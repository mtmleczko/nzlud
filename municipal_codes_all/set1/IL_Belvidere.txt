PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City 
of Belvidere, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through 
December 20, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each 
section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a 
note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By 
use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item 
in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and John 
Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Bernard Paul, former City Attorney, and Ms. Romelle R. 
Cunningham, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this 
publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances 
which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool 
in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or 
omitted are readopted as a new code of ordinances by the city council.

unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect

its discretion fine the offender any sum exceeding the minimum fine or penalty so imposed but not 
exceeding the amount set forth by the statutes of the State of Illinois as the maximum amount 
authorized for a municipality, such amount being in addition to any court cost that is applied by the 
court. 
(c) ?This section and any section of this Code imposing the penalty or providing for an administrative 
hearing or procedure shall not be construed to preclude the city from pursuing other remedies. The 
provisions of section 1-11 with regard to remedies shall apply to this section and any other section

sections of this Code, the prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed; but not more than 
one recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense, provided that the

the city which exist at law or in equity independent of this Code. All such rights of the city shall be 
deemed cumulative. A prosecuting officer or any attorney representing the city may elect to bypass 
the provisions of this Code or to enforce the provisions of this Code in conjunction with any other

a valid transaction or law enforcement purpose or unless such disclosure is otherwise required by law. 
    All forms and databases upon which Social Security numbers may be maintained shall be designed 
in a manner such that the Social Security number may be easily deleted or redacted. For example, in a

Service or the Social Security number is otherwise inherently necessary for the performance of the city's 
business. Further, Social Security numbers may be obtained for law enforcement purposes or purposes 
of collecting sums due the city. Upon request, the city shall explain to any individual the reason for 
obtaining a Social Security number and the general policies in place to secure the Social Security 
number. 
(Ord. No. 117H, § 1(exh. A), 6-20-11)

purpose for which it was collected. 
(e) ?All Social Security numbers shall be redacted prior to providing any person, other than trained 
employees as set forth above, a document (whether hard copy or electronic form) containing a 
Social Security number. 
(Ord. No. 117H, § 1(exh. A), 6-20-11) 


Sec. 2-905. - Exceptions. 
    Nothing contained in this policy shall prohibit a city employee from collecting, using or providing a 
Social Security number to others, when required by a relevant federal or state law, subpoena, 
administrative rule or warrant. Social Security numbers may be collected and used to investigate and 
prevent fraud, collect debts, obtain credit reports, locate missing individuals, verify the identity of 
individuals who may be owed a benefit, and process payroll related transactions, including but not limited 
to child support transfers and wage garnishments. Further, this policy shall not apply to law enforcement 
personnel engaged in law enforcement activities.

Sec. 10-67. - Licenses; classes and fees. 
(a) ?Liquor licenses of the city shall be divided into the following classes: 
(1) ?Class A license shall authorize the sale of alcoholic liquors for consumption on the premises or 
otherwise, in original packages or otherwise. The annual fee for each such license shall be 
$1,750.00. No new class A licenses shall be issued. 
(2) ?Class B license shall authorize the sale of beer, ale, porter and wine for consumption on the 
premises or otherwise, in original packages or otherwise. The annual fee for each such license 
shall be $1,050.00. There shall be no more than one such license in force at any time. No new 
class B licenses shall be issued. 
(3) ?Class M licenses shall authorize the retail sale on the premises specified of alcoholic liquor for 
consumption on the premises, as well as all other sales, including, but not limited to, package 
sales and retail sales of such liquor. The class M license shall be the base license for the city. 
Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, a class M license, combined with the appropriate 
state issued license (235 ILCS 5/5-1 et seq.), will allow the licensee to engage in the sale or 
manufacture of alcoholic liquor authorized by the state license. The annual renewal fee for such 
license shall be $1,750.00. A $10,000.00 initial license fee is payable prior to license issuance. 
The local liquor commissioner (the mayor) may authorize payment of the initial license in 
installments so long as the entire initial license fee is paid not later than one year from the 
actual issuance of the class M license. In such case, the license may be issued upon 
qualification under this chapter and the payment of the first installment as approved by the local 
liquor commissioner. In the event that the licensee fails to make any required installment of the 
initial license fee at the time such installment is required, such failure shall be considered a 
violation of this chapter subjecting the licensee to fine, suspension or revocation of the class M 
liquor license. The installment payments only apply to the initial license fee and the licensee still 
must pay any regularly scheduled renewal or other required fee at the time the renewal or other 
fee is due regardless of whether the initial license fee is paid in full at that time. The initial 
license fee is nonrefundable. It shall not be prorated for any license that is applied for after May 
1. Where a new class M license is issued on or after November 1 of any year, the renewal fee 
due for the immediately following fiscal year shall be waived. 
(4) ?Bed and breakfast wine and beer license (BB) . An establishment operated as a bed and 
breakfast as defined in the city zoning code may be issued a bed and breakfast wine and beer 
license. Such license shall only authorize the provision of wine and beer to overnight guests of 
the licensee (and their guests) where the wine and beer are provided at no charge or the cost is 
a package with the rack rate. The license fee shall be $1,050.00 and may be renewed annually 
for a renewal fee of $1,050.00. 
(5) ?Caterer retailer license . 
a. ?Any licensee holding a class A, class B or class M license may obtain a caterer retailer 
license by paying an additional annual fee of $200.00. The caterer retailer license shall be 
issued as an additional license which must be displayed whenever the licensee provides 
alcoholic beverages at a location other than the licensee's principal licensed premises. The 
caterer retailer license shall authorize the licensee to sell alcoholic liquor either on site or 
offsite, whether the location is licensed or un-licensed, as an incidental part of food service. 
Prepared meals and alcoholic liquors are sold at a package price agreed upon under 
contract. The licensee may only cater to a commercially available banquet facility, hotel or 
reception facility which is fully-enclosed and not open to the general public during the 
event. The licensee shall comply with all aspects of the state liquor act (235 ILCS 5/1-1 et. 
seq.) including, but not limited to, the requirements of a caterer retailer. As such, licensee 
must also obtain a relevant state license and must serve the alcoholic beverages only as 
part of a prepared meal package. 
b. ?Each event at which a caterer-retailer provides alcoholic liquor shall be limited to six hours 
in duration. 
c. ?The liquor commissioner, or his designee, is specifically granted the authority to issue an 
order directing the licensee to cease operations after an event has commenced if, in the 
liquor commissioner's opinion, the event is jeopardizing the health and safety of the 
community. 
d. ?Such authorization is subject to all applicable ordinances, regulations, and statutes and if 
the licensee violates any ordinance, regulation or statute, the liquor commissioner may 
revoke the endorsement of the licensee as provided by ordinance and statute. 
e. ?A person or entity holding a valid local license issued by another Illinois unit of local 
government and a valid state caterer retailer license may apply for and obtain a caterer 
retailer license allowing the provision of liquor on a catering basis within the city. The 
annual fee for such an endorsement shall be $1,200.00. If such an entity's foreign local 
license or state license is revoked, suspended or not renewed, such entity's city catering 
endorsements shall be immediately null and void and revoked without further action. 
(6) ?Special use permit license . A special use permit license shall allow an Illinois licensed retailer 
to transfer a portion of its alcoholic liquor inventory from its retail licensed premises to the 
premises specified in the license hereby created, and to sell or offer for sale at retail, only in the 
premises specified in the license hereby created, the transferred alcoholic liquor for use or 
consumption, but not for resale in any form. A special use permit license may be granted for up 
to three days per location in any 12-month period. An applicant for the special use permit 
license must also submit with the application proof satisfactory to the liquor control 
commissioner that the applicant will provide dram shop liability insurance to the maximum limits 
and must have a valid state special use permit license (which may be obtained after local 
approval). Application for a special use permit license shall be made upon forms supplied by the 
local liquor commissioner and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable $100.00 application 
fee. 
(b) ?No license shall be issued unless the applicant is in full and total compliance with the city zoning 
ordinances, the ordinances in this chapter, and all ordinances of the city. If a license is issued in 
error because the applicant is not in full and total compliance with all city ordinances, such license 
shall be subject to revocation. 
(c) ?All applications shall be submitted to the liquor control commissioner for his recommendation in 
accordance with sections 10-72, 10-73 and 10-74 of this chapter, prior to the filing of any 
applications with the planning and zoning commission. Final approval or denial shall be made by the 
liquor control commissioner. 
(d) ?Premises . Any license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid only for the premises described 
in the application and license and all sales, service and dispensing shall be done within an enclosed 
building, unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter. 
(e) ?Renewal of class A, B, BB and M licenses . Licenses for all retail sale of alcoholic liquor hereunder 
shall be issued by the liquor control commissioner, and he may renew the license of all present class 
A, B, BB and M licensees at the expiration of their license period; provided that each applicant for a 
license or for the renewal thereof and the premises where such business is to be carried on comply 
fully with all the conditions and provisions of this chapter. The liquor control commissioner shall not 
issue any additional new class A or class B licenses. Class A or B licenses with no remaining 
transfers shall be surrendered to the city and a class M license shall be issued as replacement so 
long as all other provisions of this Code are complied with and the licensee is otherwise eligible for a 
liquor license. 
There may be the issuance of an unlimited amount of class M licenses, provided all provisions of this 
chapter are complied with.

Sec. 10-68. - Duration; non-proration of fee; effect of transferring. 
    All licenses provided for by this article shall terminate and expire on April 30 next after the issuance 
thereof. In the event that any person to whom a license has been issued by the city authorizing the retail 
sale of alcoholic liquor sells such retail liquor establishment, or ceases operation of the establishment for 
any reason, including but not limited to revocation of the license, prior to the termination and expiration 
date of the license, there shall not be any refund of any license fee. 
(Ord. No. 126H, § 2(exh. A), 10-3-11) 


Sec. 10-69. - Transferability; renewal. 
(a) ?Transferability. A license shall be a purely personal privilege good for a period not to exceed one 
year after issuance unless sooner revoked as provided in this chapter, and shall not constitute 
property; nor shall it be subject to attachment, garnishment or execution; nor shall it be alienable or 
transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or hypothecated. Such 
license shall not descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution but shall cease upon the 
death of the licensee provided that executors or administrators of the estate of any deceased 
licensee and the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee, which estate consists in part of 
alcohol liquor, under order of the appropriate court may exercise the privileges of the deceased or 
insolvent or bankrupt licensee until the expiration of the license, but not longer than six months after 
the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such licensee. 
(b) ?Sale of licensed business. 
(1) ?On the sale of any business licensed under this article, the liquor control commissioner may, 
upon surrender of an original class A or class B license, issue a new class A or class B license 
to the vendee thereof for the unexpired period of the original license; however, such vendee 
shall first comply with all the laws of this state and the ordinances of the city relating to the retail 
sale of alcoholic liquor. It shall further be the duty of any licensee under this chapter, before 
issuance of any license to a new licensee, to submit to the commissioner a bulk sales affidavit 
or affidavits in compliance with the bulk sales provisions of the state uniform commercial code 
of S.H.A. ch. 26, section 1-101 et seq. or such other applicable statutes governing bulk sales 
within the state so that the exact amount of indebtedness of the party selling the business is 
known, and such issuance shall not be executed until the commissioner is satisfied that 
adequate provisions are made for the payment of all obligations relating to the business or 
license of the seller. Any class A and class B license issued to a vendee under the provisions of 
this section shall not be eligible to be surrendered or to be issued to another purchaser of the 
business after two transfers have occurred after December 16, 1985. Class A and class B 
licenses may be transferred on two separate occasions between vendors and vendees. These 
two transfers must be the first two transfers of that particular business in chronological order 
after December 16, 1985. These two transfers would still be eligible for class A or class B 
license and therefore, the non-refundable deposit required under section 10-67 would not be 
required. Any class A or class B license would be reissued as a class M license unless it 
qualified under the two-transfer rule as described above. As such, upon the second allowable 
transfer of a class A or class B license, the new licensee shall be issued a class M license. Any 
license that is the subject of a revocation action cannot be transferred as a class A or class B 
license while the revocation proceedings are pending or after the proceedings if a revocation 
becomes effective. 
(2) ?Any license held but not in use for a period of six months or more is void and shall be 
surrendered to the city and may not be reissued. 
(3) ?A class M license is nontransferable as set forth in subsection (a) above. If a license holder 
sells or transfers the business or the assets of the business to another, the transferee shall be 
required to apply for a new class M liquor license. 
(c) ?A transfer shall be deemed to occur: 
(1) ?In the case of a sole proprietorship upon the sale or transfer of licensee's business as a going 
concern or upon the sale of a majority of licensee's assets to another; 
(2) ?In the case of a partnership, upon the dissolution of the partnership, upon the elimination of 
one or more general or limited partners, upon the sale of the business as a going concern, or 
upon the sale of a majority of the licensee's assets. New partners may be added without a 
transfer, subject to the commissioner's approval and compliance with necessary background 
investigations; 
(3) ?In the case of a corporation, upon the sale or transfer of the licensee's local business as a 
going concern to another, either as a stand alone business or as part of a larger transfer, upon 
the sale or transfer of a majority of licensee's local assets associated with the license, upon the 
sale or transfer of 50 percent or more of the capital stock of the licensee; or upon the sale or 
transfer of 50 percent or more of the capital stock of a parent corporation of licensee that itself 
owns 50 percent or more of licensee's capital stock.

filing of a subsequent application if any principal of the subsequent applicant is also a principal of the 
prior applicant unless otherwise stated in the subsequent application.

applicant or by an officer of a corporate applicant. 
(d) ?An application may be filed at any time regardless of whether there is a license of the requested 
class available. The liquor control commissioner shall not be required to hold a hearing or otherwise 
process the application if no license of the class requested is available. If he chooses to do so, the 
liquor control commissioner may hold a hearing on an application or otherwise investigate even if 
there is presently no license available of the class requested and may update his investigation or 
hold a further hearing if he deems it advisable at the time that a license of the requested class 
becomes available.

Sec. 10-75. - Restrictions on licenses. 
    The issuance of a liquor license is a personal privilege and the commissioner may deny an 
application if the issuance of such license would tend to create a law enforcement problem, result in or 
add to an undue concentration of licenses, or have a deleterious impact on the health, safety or welfare of 
the area in which the licensed premise is to be located or in the city as a whole. No such license shall be 
issued to: 
(1) ?An applicant who is not of good character and reputation either in the city or otherwise; 
(2) ?An applicant, if it is an individual, who is not a citizen of the United States; 
(3) ?An applicant, if it is an individual, who has been convicted of a felony under any federal or state

rehabilitation shall be on the applicant;

would be ineligible to receive a license hereunder for any reason other than residence in the 
city; 
(9) ?An applicant corporation, if any officer, manager or director thereof, or any stockholder or 
stockholders owning in an aggregate more than five percent of the stock of such corporation, 
would be ineligible to receive a license hereunder for any reason other than citizenship and 
residence in the city; 
(10) ?An applicant corporation unless it is incorporated in the state, or unless it is a foreign 
corporation which is qualified under the Business Corporation Act of 1983 (805 ILCS 5/1.01 et

(11) ?An applicant whose place of business is conducted by either a manager or agent unless the 
manager or agent possesses the same qualifications required of the licensee, except those 
relating to residency;

manufacture, possession or sale of alcoholic liquor, subsequent to the passage of the Illinois 
Liquor Control Act of 1934 (235 ILCS 5/1-1 et seq.) or has forfeited bond to appear in court to 
answer charges for any such violation; 
(13) ?An applicant who neither beneficially owns the premises for which a license is sought, nor has 
a lease thereon for the full period for which the license is to be issued unless the license for said 
premises is a multi-year lease both due to expire within the license year and which contains 
provisions for renewal of said lease; 
(14) ?Any individual who is responsible for administering or enforcing any of the provisions of this 
chapter, including any employee of the police department, members of the commission, the 
mayor, chairman or member of the city council; and no such official shall be interested directly 
or indirectly in the manufacture, sale or distribution of alcoholic liquor, except that license may 
be granted to such official in relation to premises which are not located within the territory 
subject to the jurisdiction of that official if the issuance of such license is approved by the 
commissioner; 
(15) ?A person other than a beneficial owner of the business to be operated by the licensee; 
(16) ?A person who has been convicted of a gambling offense as prescribed by any of subsections 
(a)(3) through (a)(10) of 720 ILCS 5/28-1, or as proscribed by 720 ILCS 5/28-3, the Criminal 
Code of 1961, as amended, or as proscribed by a statute replaced by any of the aforesaid 
statutory provisions; 
(17) ?A person to whom a federal wagering stamp has been issued by the federal government for 
the current tax period;

Sec. 10-78. - Displaying license; replacement license. 
    Every licensee shall cause the license to be framed and hung in plain view in a conspicuous place 
on the licensed premises. In the event the current license is not displayed pursuant to this section the city

license pursuant to this section. The replacement license fee shall be $50.00. 
(Ord. No. 126H, § 2(exh. A), 10-3-11) 


Sec. 10-79. - Insurance. 
    No license or permit shall be issued hereunder unless the applicant files with the application an 
insurance certificate, issued by an insurance company that is authorized to do business in the state, 
certifying that the applicant, and the owner of the premises housing the establishment from where the 
liquor will be sold, has in force and effect liquor liability insurance of not less than $1,000.00 per

Sec. 10-80. - Renewal of license. 
(a) ?Any licensee seeking renewal of his liquor license shall make application to the liquor control 
commissioner and shall provide the same information and documentation under oath as required for

requirement for any item or document if he believes such requirement is unnecessary in determining 
qualifications of the licensee or premises. He may also, in his sole discretion, accept an affidavit in 
lieu of documentation. 
(b) ?Completed applications for renewal of license shall be submitted to the liquor control commissioner 
on or before March 15 of each year. Failure to submit a completed application for renewal (including 
all required documentation) shall constitute grounds for delay of renewal of the license and an 
additional 50 percent shall be added to the annual renewal fee. Failure to submit a completed 
application for renewal before May 1 may be treated by the liquor control commissioner as the 
forfeiture of the license and as the submission of an original license application by a non-licensee. 
(Ord. No. 126H, § 2(exh. A), 10-3-11) 


Sec. 10-81. - Special event retailer's license. 
(a) ?"Special event retailer" means an educational, fraternal, political, civic, religious, or nonprofit

and on the dates designated by a special event retail license. 
(b) ?A special event retailer's license (not-for-profit) shall permit the licensee to purchase alcoholic 
liquors from an Illinois licensed distributor (unless the licensee purchases less than $500.00 of 
alcoholic liquors for the special event, in which case the licensee may purchase the alcoholic liquors 
from a licensed retailer) and shall allow the licensee to sell and offer for sale, at retail, alcoholic 
liquors for use or consumption, but not for resale in any form and only at the location and on the 
specific dates and times designated for the special event in the license. An applicant for a special 
event retailer license must: 
(1) ?Furnish with the application: 
a. ?A resale number issued under Section 2c of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act or evidence 
that the applicant is registered under Section 2a of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act; 
b. ?A current, valid exemption identification number issued under Section 1g of the Retailers' 
Occupation Tax Act, and a certification to the commission that the purchase of alcoholic 
liquors will be a tax-exempt purchase; or 
c. ?A statement that the applicant is not registered under Section 2a of the Retailers' 
Occupation Tax Act, does not hold a resale number under Section 2c of the Retailers' 
Occupation Tax Act, and does not hold an exemption number under Section 1g of the 
Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, in which event the commission shall set forth on the special 
event retailer's license a statement to that effect. 
(2) ?Submit with the application proof satisfactory to the commissioner that the applicant will provide 
dram shop liability insurance in the maximum limits; and 
(3) ?Show proof satisfactory to the commissioner that the applicant has obtained a state license 
(which may be provided after approval of the local license). 
(c) ?The alcoholic beverages served shall be confined to a completely enclosed area, which shall be 
approved by the liquor commissioner. The area shall be enclosed by a fence or wall in a manner to 
prohibit ingress and egress to the area by persons at other than the designated entrance. No liquor

(d) ?The liquor commissioner may, upon written request of the applicant for a special festival or event, 
permit, and in his discretion, order that section 10-42 of this chapter not apply to a particular special 
event or festival. If the liquor commissioner orders that section 10-42 of this chapter does not apply 
to the special event or festival, persons under the age of 21 may enter upon or into the premises 
where alcohol is being served or consumed. However, section 10-39 of this chapter will remain 
effective and, therefore, no person under the age of 21 may be in possession of or consume any 
alcoholic beverage. No order waiving section 10-42 of this chapter shall be issued until the persons 
requesting such action satisfy the liquor commissioner that: 
(1) ?All persons serving alcohol at the event or in any way related to the sales of alcohol at the 
event (e.g. identification checkers) have been adequately trained to ascertain whether a 
customer is of legal age to possess or consume alcohol; 
(2) ?A mechanism is in place to verify the age of every person who desires to purchase or consume 
alcohol and that such persons shall be issued some form of unique, nontransferable easily 
visible identification (e.g. unique colored wristband) (hereinafter UVI); and 
(3) ?That the special festival or event shall provide adequate and competent security to protect the 
health and welfare of participants and to ensure that no person, who is not legally allowed to 
drink or possess alcohol, consumes or possess any alcoholic beverage. 
(e) ?The persons organizing and/or operating the special event shall: 
(1) ?Adequately train all persons serving alcohol to verify the age of those purchasing or possessing 
alcohol; 
(2) ?Not allow any person to purchase, possess or consume any alcohol unless that person has an 
official UVI; 
(3) ?Shall provide adequate security as set forth above; and 
(4) ?Shall comply with all other portions of this chapter, the city municipal code and state statutes. 
(f) ?No person shall possess, purchase or consume any alcoholic beverage at a special event unless 
that person has in his or her possession a valid UVI and unless that person is otherwise lawfully able 
to consume alcohol. 
If a special event is in violation of a portion of this Code, or if any person is found to possess, purchase or 
consume alcohol in violation of this Code, the liquor commissioner may immediately and summarily 
revoke the special event liquor license and order the immediate termination of all alcohol sales, 
consumption and possession at the special event. Further, the organizers and operators of the festival or 
event may be fined or penalized as set forth in this chapter and any other provision of state statute or the 
city municipal code. 
(g) ?The city liquor commissioner shall impose such restrictions on the sale, dispensing, consumption or 
possession of alcoholic beverages at such events as he deems proper including, but not limited to, 
location, hours, noise, number of persons, qualifications of bartenders, types of beverages, 
containers for beverages, litter containers, lighting and traffic control. 
(h) ?A licensee that is issued a special permit under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the 
same restriction and penalties as a liquor licensee for transfer or delivery of alcoholic liquor to any 
person to whom such transfer or delivery is prohibited, and shall be under the same obligation as a 
liquor licensee to demand presentation of identification of persons whom the corporation or its agent 
has reason to believe are not legally entitled to possess such alcoholic liquor.

commissioner under this article;

would render the licensee ineligible for a license at the subject premises; 
(4) ?Any violation of any law that is connected to operation or ownership of the licensed business or 
premises; 
(5) ?Any violation of a rule or regulation of the state liquor control commission in connection with the

southerly streets. The word "streets" shall include avenues. One hundred numbers shall be assigned 
on each street to each block or square not exceeding 400 feet, and an additional 100 numbers shall 
be assigned for each 400 feet, provided the numbers shall be maintained, as nearly as practicable, 
so that the numbers of blocks shall show their range easterly or westerly of State Street or northerly 
or southerly of the Kishwaukee River. Twenty feet shall be the standard length of a single number. 
The intervening narrow streets and alleys shall not be taken or considered as the boundaries of 
blocks or squares.

hundred as aforesaid, and in all respects shall adhere to the decimal system of enumeration. Also on 
all streets not extending to the initial point, the same order of enumeration shall be observed as 
though such street did actually extend to such point, so that blocks in the same relative situation on

numbers. And it is made the duty of the owners or occupants of buildings situated in the city to 
number such buildings in the manner herein provided.

    Structure. See "Building". 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cumulative 
percentage of damage during the life of the building equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of 
the structure before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and 
materials must be included in this determination. The term includes "Repetitive loss buildings" (see 
definition). 
    Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a structure 
taking place during the life of the building in which the cumulative percentage of improvements: 
(1) ?Equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or

policy to be suspended. 
The director is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The 
stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if 
necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes a 
suspension of the permit.

planning and zoning commission. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and 
shall state: 
(1) ?The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation; and 
(2) ?The time and place of the hearing.

requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including: Ordinance 873G. However, this article 
does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does

article and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever 
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

ARTICLE III. - GENERAL BUSINESS REGISTRATION LICENSE 


Sec. 26-76. - Purpose. 
    Each business establishment located within the city is an integral part of, and affects, the physical 
and economic development of the city. This article is intended to keep a current listing of all businesses 
doing business in the city, aid the police department, fire department and other departments in their 
responsibilities and to ensure proper zoning compliance. 
(Ord. No. 361H, § 1(Exh. A), 7-17-17) 


Sec. 26-77. - Definitions. 
    Business. The term business, for purposes of this article, means any occupation or endeavor 
resulting in or intending to sell any commodity, whether at wholesale or retail or the provision of any 
service from a fixed location within the city, or territory subject to the city's ordinances, except businesses, 
trades or occupations which have been preempted from municipal regulation. The term business 
excludes any not for profit organization, or other organization that does not receive compensation for its 
services or goods. 
    Person. The term person, for purposes of this article, shall include any person, partnership, 
corporation, association, firm or other association. 
(Ord. No. 361H, § 1(Exh. A), 7-17-17)

    It shall be unlawful for any person to operate, conduct or engage in any business within the city, or 
any territory subject to its ordinances, without first having obtained a business registration license from 
the city. The business registration license shall be specific to a single location within the city. If a person 
operates more than one location for the same business or multiple businesses, each location must obtain 
a separate business registration license. If one person operates more than one business from a single 
location only one business registration license is required. However, if multiple persons operate legally 
unrelated businesses from the same location, each business must obtain an individual business 
registration license. 
(Ord. No. 361H, § 1(Exh. A), 7-17-17) 


Sec. 26-79. - Business registration license issuance (BRL). 
    The business registration license shall be issued by the city clerk, upon application, on forms

the property owners' and business' owners' name, address, email address including a home address or 
outside corporate address, phone number. If the business is operated by a manager (not the owner), then 
the same contact information is required for the manager. The applicant shall also describe the nature of 
the proposed business and the type of goods to be offered for sale or services offered. No fee shall be 
charged for issuance of a business registration license nor is any background check required. However, 
any other license and/or fee required by another section (eg' second hand stores etc.) must obtain that 
license permit and pay the applicable fee. 
    The business registration license is not transferable and in the event of the sale or transfer of the 
business, the sale or transfer of a majority of the stock of any person owning the business, or upon the 
sale or transfer of the majority of the assets of the business {including good will), a new business 
registration license must be obtained within 60 days of the sale or transfer by the person then owning or 
operating the business. 
    The BRL shall be prominently displayed at the location for which it is issued. The issuance of a BRL 
shall not relieve the person or business, to whom it is issued, from complying with any other relevant 
ordinance or statute, including but not limited to the city zoning ordinance. Issuance of the BRL does not 
guarantee compliance with such other laws and ordinances and it is the responsibility of the person or 
business to whom the BRL is issued to ensure compliance with such laws and ordinances.

owner of the property at which the business is located. For purposes of this section, a person 
shall be deemed to have knowingly allowed a criminal use of the business or location if a 
similarly situated reasonable person would have suspected the existence of criminal activity. 
(b) ?Suspension of a business registration license shall begin immediately upon the ruling of suspension 
and shall be for a term of not more than 30 days after the reason for the suspension is cured.

suspending or finding insufficient reason to revoke or suspend the business registration license. In 
making the decision, the commission may consider whether the reasons articulated and presented

Sec. 58-91. - Certificate of appropriateness required. 
(a) ?It shall be unlawful for any person, group of persons, association or corporation to make any 
alteration to any landmark or any building, structure or site, or part thereof, in a historic district unless 
a certificate of appropriateness is issued for such alteration by the commission, or by the city council 
on appeal, or unless such alteration is specifically permitted by subsection (b) of this section, or

of subsection (c) of this section. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required before a building 
permit, moving permit or demolition permit is issued for any landmark or property within a historic 
district. A certificate of appropriateness is required if the building, structure or site will be altered, 
extended or repaired in such a manner as to produce a major change in the exterior appearance of 
the building, structure or site. Such major changes include but are not limited to: 
(1) ?Major changes by additions, alterations, maintenance, reconstruction, rehabilitation, renovation 
or repair; 
(2) ?Any new construction and/or demolition in whole or in part requiring a permit from the city; 
(3) ?Moving a building; 
(4) ?Any construction, alteration, demolition or removal affecting a significant exterior architectural 
feature or one specified in the ordinance designating the landmark or historic district. 
(b) ?No certificate of appropriateness shall be required for the following listed alterations: 
(1) ?Change in exterior paint scheme or colors; 
(2) ?Installation of, or change in, storm doors, storm windows or screens; 
(3) ?Installation of, or change in, window air conditioners; 
(4) ?Installation of, or change in, radio or television antennae or satellite dishes; 
(5) ?Ordinary repair and maintenance of existing exterior architectural features which is not a 
change in materials and which does not change the basic structural appearance of the building 
or structure. 
(c) ?The planning department is expressly authorized to issue certificate of appropriateness for the 
following listed alterations: 
(1) ?Construction and repair of fences; 
(2) ?Roof and gutter replacement, but only with like materials; 
(3) ?Driveway and sidewalk replacement;

style; and 
(6) ?Any replacement of materials with like materials.

commission and the appeal shall be treated as an application for a certificate and shall be subject to 
all prescribed procedures. 
(Ord. No. 94H, § 1(exh. A), 12-20-10) 


Sec. 58-92. - Natural destruction or demolition. 
(a) ?In the case of partial or complete natural destruction or demolition of a landmark or site within a 
historic district, the owner will be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the 
commission prior to reconstruction. 
(b) ?Although exact duplication of the previous structure may not be required, the exterior design of the 
property shall be in harmony with:

(2) ?The character of the historic preservation district. 
(Ord. No. 94H, § 1(exh. A), 12-20-10) 


Sec. 58-93. - Criteria for certificate of appropriateness. 
    In considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall be guided by 
the following general standards: 
(1) ?A property owner is entitled to a reasonable economic use of his property and consideration 
shall be given to the economic loss or hardship that would result from the denial of an 
application. 
(2) ?Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which 
requires minimum alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment or to use a 
property for its originally intended purpose. 
(3) ?The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its 
environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or 
distinctive architectural feature should be avoided when possible. 
(4) ?All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations 
that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be 
discouraged. 
(5) ?Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and 
development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have 
acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(6) ?Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, 
structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(7) ?Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In 
the event replacement is necessary, the new materials should match the material being 
replaced in composition, design, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of 
missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features, 
substantiated by historical, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or 
the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(8) ?The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. 
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall 
not be undertaken. 
(9) ?Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources 
affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
(10) ?Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be 
discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, 
architectural or cultural material and such design is compatible with the size, scale, material and 
character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(11) ?Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings should be done in such a manner 
that if they were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original 
building would be unimpaired. 
(12) ?Contemporary design for new buildings in a historic district and additions to existing buildings 
or landscaping should not be discouraged if the design is compatible with the size, scale, color, 
material and character of the district, building or its environment. 
(13) ?Design guidelines for applying the criteria for review of certificates of appropriateness shall, at 
a minimum, consider the following architectural criteria: 
a. ?Height. The height of any proposed alteration or construction should be compatible with the 
style and character of the landmark, and with surrounding structures in a historic district. 
b. ?Proportions of windows and doors. The proportions and relationships between doors and 
windows should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark. 
c. ?Relationship of building masses and spaces. The relationship of a structure within an 
historic district to the open space between it and adjoining structures should be compatible. 
d. ?Roof shape. The design of the roof, facia and cornice should be compatible with the 
architectural style and character of the landmark. 
e. ?Landscaping. Landscaping should be compatible with the architectural character and 
appearance of the landmark. 
f. ?Scale. The scale of the structure after alteration, construction or partial demolition should be 
compatible with its architectural style and character and with surrounding structures in an 
historic district. 
g. ?Directional expression. Facades in historic districts should blend with other structures with 
regard to directional expression. Structures in an historic district should be compatible with 
the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding structures. The directional 
expression of a landmark after alteration, construction or partial demolition should be 
compatible with its original architectural style and character. 
h. ?Architectural details. Architectural details, including types of materials, colors and textures 
should be treated so as to make a landmark compatible with its original architectural style 
and character, and to preserve and enhance the architectural style and character of an 
historic district. 
i. ?New structures. New structures in a historic district shall be compatible with the architectural 
styles and design in the district. 
(Ord. No. 94H, § 1(exh. A), 12-20-10) 


Sec. 58-94. - Application for a certificate of appropriateness. 
    An owner of a landmark or property within a historic district shall apply to the planning department for

forward all completed application for major changes and additions and those certificates denied by the 
planning department to the commission for review. 
(Ord. No. 94H, § 1(exh. A), 12-20-10) 


Sec. 58-95. - Grant or denial of certificate of appropriateness. 
(a) ?An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission at its next 
regularly scheduled meeting following the filing with the planning department. However, if the 
application is filed with the department fewer than 21 days prior to the next meeting, then the 
application shall be reviewed at the second regularly scheduled meeting following the filing, unless 
the commission, on its own motion, votes to review it earlier. 
(b) ?Notice of time and place for review of a certificate of appropriateness shall be given to the property 
owner, by regular mail, not less than five days prior to the meeting. The owner proposing the

(c) ?If the commission finds that the alteration proposed by the owner of the landmark or property

with any applicable design guidelines adopted by the commission, then the commission shall 
approve the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for the alteration. 
(d) ?If the commission finds that the alteration proposed by the owner of the landmark or property 
located in a historic district is not in compliance with the criteria listed in section 58-93 of this chapter 
or with any design guidelines adopted by the commission, then the commission shall disapprove the 
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for such alterations. If the commission disapproves the 
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission may, in its discretion, approve the 
issuance of a certificate for alterations contingent upon certain modifications. 
(e) ?The planning department, within five days after the commission approves the issuance of a 
certificate of appropriateness shall, by regular mail communicate the approval to the owner. A copy 
of the approved certificate of appropriateness shall be forwarded to the building department. 
(f) ?A certificate of appropriateness shall be invalid if changes in the plans, approved by the commission 
are necessary in obtaining a building permit or if the building permit issued for the work becomes 
invalid. The certificate of appropriateness remains valid for the same period as the building permit 
(one year).

Sec. 58-96. - Certificate of demolition. 
(a) ?If the owner of a landmark or property in a historic district proposes to demolish all or any part of a 
designated landmark or property within a historic district, the owner shall apply for a certificate of 
demolition. Procedures provided in section 58-95 of this chapter shall be followed concerning the 
application, except as expressly modified. 
(b) ?In addition to the criteria and guidelines for a certificate of appropriateness provided in section 58-
95, the commission shall also consider evidence and testimony on the following factors: 
(1) ?The state of repair and structural stability of the structure, or portion thereof, proposed for 
demolition; 
(2) ?The extent and process of demolition, including any proposed changes in landscaping. 
(c) ?The commission may, in its discretion, continue its consideration of the application for a certificate of 
demolition to some date certain, not to exceed four months. During the period of continuance, the 
planning department and the commission shall attempt to preserve the structure by contacting 
private citizens, civic groups or other government boards or agencies seeking potential buyers, or by 
any other appropriate means. During the period of continuance, if required by the commission, the 
owner of the landmark or property within a historic district must place the structure on the open 
market for sale. The owner is under no obligation to accept any offer to purchase received during this 
period; however, refusal to accept a bone fide offer may be considered by the commission as 
evidence regarding the economic loss of hardship to the owner. 
(d) ?At either the original or the continued hearing for a certificate of demolition, the decision of the 
commission shall be according to the criteria for the issuance of certificate of appropriateness. 
(Ord. No. 94H, § 1(exh. A), 12-20-10) 


Sec. 58-97. - Penalty. 
    Any person who undertakes or causes an alteration, construction, demolition or removal of any

functions, or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and

material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to that 
audience. 
(d) ?Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity

Sec. 74-37. - Harmful material. 
(a) ?Generally. A person who, with knowledge that a person is a child, that is a person under 18 years of 
age, or who fails to exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly 
distributes to or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to, or offers to distribute or exhibit any 
harmful material to a child, is guilty of a violation of this section. 
(b) ?Predominantly prurient in interest. 
(1) ?Material is harmful if, to the average person, applying contemporary standards, its predominant 
appeal, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, 
sex or excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or 
representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming social importance of which is 
substantially less than its prurient appeal. 
(2) ?"Material," as used in this section, means any writing, picture, record, or other representation or 
embodiment. 
(3) ?"Distribute" means to transfer possession of, whether with or without consideration. 
(4) ?"Knowingly," as used in this section, means having knowledge of the contents of the subject 
matter, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection that would have disclosed the 
contents thereof. 
(c) ?Prurient interest judged in reference to children. 
(1) ?The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall be judged with reference to 
average children of the same general age of the child to whom such material was offered, 
distributed, sent or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the 
circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for specially 
susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the material shall be judged with 
reference to its intended or probable recipient group. 
(2) ?In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, 
dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate the material is being commercially exploited for 
the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the 
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is in 
fact substantially less than its prurient appeal. 
(d) ?Exceptions to prosecution. 
(1) ?Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any library operated by an accredited 
institution of higher education from circulating harmful material to any person under 18 years of 
age, provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational purpose; and it 
shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that the act 
charged was committed in aid of legitimate scientific or educational purposes. 
(2) ?Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from distributing to his child any harmful 
material. 
(3) ?Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance on any of the following 
documents as proof of the age of a child shall be a defense to any prosecution under this 
section: a document issued by the federal government or any state, county or municipal 
government or subdivision or agency thereof, including but not limited to a motor vehicle 
operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act or an

or request for, any money or property (whether for profit or charitable purposes), to call from house to 
house or to engage in street solicitations for charitable solicitation or allied purposes in the city without

(Ord. No. 660G, § 1, 9-20-04) 


Sec. 78-107. - Regulations. 
(a) ?An application for certificate of registration for house-to-house or street solicitation for charitable

of sales or subscription methods involving fraud, misrepresentation, or false and misleading 
statements. The certificate shall be valid for 30 days (one month).

shall indemnify and hold the city harmless for any injuries to any person or property or claims by any 
person arising out of such solicitation.

(b) ?A sign or card so exhibited shall constitute sufficient notice to any solicitor or person engaged in 
commercial canvas merchandising that the occupant(s) of the building prohibit uninvited solicitation 
or commercial canvas merchandising. 
(c) ?If a building contains the sign "NO SOLICITORS" or "NO SOLICITATION" regardless of whether the 
sign complies with subsection (a) above, all solicitors and/or persons engaging in commercial 
canvass merchandising shall immediately and peacefully depart the premises without making 
contact with the occupants thereof. 
(d) ?It is unlawful and shall constitute a nuisance for any person to go upon any premises and/or ring the 
door bell upon or near any door, or create any sound in any other manner which is commonly

audience with the occupant and engage in solicitation or commercial canvass merchandising in

Sec. 78-111. - Time limit on soliciting and commercial canvass merchandising.

(Ord. No. 660G, § 1, 9-20-04) 


Sec. 78-112. - Activities not requiring registration. 
    No person shall be required to comply with sections 78-106, 78-107, and 78-113 if said person does

merchandising. However, any such person shall comply with the remainder of this chapter, including but 
not limited to section 78-112. 
(Ord. No. 660G, § 1, 9-20-04) 


Sec. 78-113. - Purpose. 
    The corporate authorities of the city recognize the need to guarantee the rights to freedom of 
expression, religion, association and speech embodied in the United States Constitution as well as the 
state constitution. However, the corporate authorities also find that the unregulated solicitation of funds 
and/or property, constitutes a danger to the city's residents. Some solicitors and commercial canvass 
merchandisers have and do utilize their activities to engage in criminal conduct, including but not limited, 
to fraud and identity theft. Residents are even more susceptible to these activities when the solicitor or 
commercial canvass merchandiser appears at their home or place of business, uninvited, and attempts to 
sell goods, services or solicit funds. The corporate authorities also recognize the right of its citizens to 
privacy and the quite enjoyment of their homes and business which are frequently invaded by uninvited 
solicitors and commercial canvass merchandisers. 
    This article is intended to: 
(1) ?Limit the opportunity for fraudulent or other criminal behavior by solicitors or commercial 
canvass merchandisers; 
(2) ?Provide a mechanism to identify and locate those engaging in fraudulent or criminal solicitation 
or commercial canvass merchandising; and 
(3) ?Create a mechanism by which residents may "avert their eyes/ears" from unwanted solicitation 
and commercial canvass merchandising, without unreasonably infringing upon constitutional 
protections including, but not limited to, free speech, freedom of expression, freedom of religion 
and freedom of association.

primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage 
over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary 
policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to 
cover such loss.

this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to 
demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required 
under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under

(a) ?Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this 
section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the 
permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The 
security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1) ?The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2) ?Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the permittee's failure to 
comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued 
pursuant to this article; and 
(3) ?The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the city 
may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this 
article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the 
permittee is required by this article to perform that the city must perform itself or have completed 
as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other 
payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b) ?Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the form, at the permittee's 
election, of a surety bond in a form acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form 
acceptable to the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, 
at a minimum: 
(1) ?Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the city and the permittee; 
(2) ?Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the city of any amounts 
covered by it; and 
(3) ?Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the State of Illinois at which it can be 
drawn. 
(c) ?Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably 
estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the 
construction under the permit, as determined by the director, and may also include reasonable, 
directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform 
such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in 
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one 
location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be 
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the 
director may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of 
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of 
the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been 
required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d) ?Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its 
intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the 
security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-
day notice period. The bond or letter of credit shall provide that the city may withdraw monies with or 
without the consent or notice to permittee. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit 
required under this article. 
(1) ?Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree trimming permits shall include 
assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are 
experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an 
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished. 
(2) ?Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be 
tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment 
of damages. The city will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees 
removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of 
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or 
unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the removal and replacement of trees if 
trimming or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition. 
(c) ?Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The city may require that special measures be taken 
to preserve specimen trees or trees of special significance. The required measures may consist of 
higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means. 
(d) ?Chemcial use. 
(1) ?Except as provided in the following paragraph, no utility shall spray, inject or pour any 
chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation in the city for any purpose, including the 
control of growth, insects or disease. 
(2) ?Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be permitted on rights-of-way unless the 
utility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that such spraying is the only practicable 
method of vegetation control.

Sec. 98-818. - Removal, relocation, or modifications of utility facilities. 
(a) ?Notice. Within 30 days following written notice from the city, a utility shall, at its own expense, 
protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the 
position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the director determines that such 
removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, 
maintenance, or installation of any city improvement in or upon, or the operations of the city in or 
upon, the rights-of-way. 
(b) ?Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within ten days following written notice from the city, any utility 
that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-
of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the 
rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(1) ?Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise 
permitted by applicable law; 
(2) ?If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if 
required; 
(3) ?If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation 
of this article; or 
(4) ?If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license 
or franchise. 
(c) ?Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move 
any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, 
appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, 
the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and 
shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. 
(d) ?Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the city, the 
utility shall notify the city within 30 days. Following receipt of such notice the city may direct the utility 
to remove all or any portion of the facility if the director determines that such removal will be in the 
best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the city does not direct the 
utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the city, the 
abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the 
facility by another utility or person. 
(Ord. No. 972G, § 2, 8-5-08) 


Sec. 98-819. - Clean-up and restoration.

procedures for securing a permit: 
(1) ?If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall 
take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public 
on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not 
exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on 
the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be 
provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other 
means of access to the facility is available. 
(2) ?In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the director or his or her duly 
authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for

should be granted. 
(b) ?Authority to grant variances. The director shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each 
provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual basis. 
(c) ?Conditions for granting of variance. The director may authorize a variance only if the utility 
requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
(1) ?One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an 
irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the 
provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
(2) ?All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the 
provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested 
approach. 
(d) ?Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the 
director may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions 
that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of this 
article. 
(e) ?Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including 
denial of a variance, made by the director under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to 
appeal to the city's committee-of-the-whole, or such other board or commission as it may designate.

Sec. 98-822. - Penalties. 
    Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of 
this article shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be 
times when the city will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not 
or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another 
allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's 
costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility 
that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a 
permit related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay 
the costs apportioned to it. 
(Ord. No. 972G, § 2, 8-5-08) 


Sec. 98-823. - Enforcement. 
    Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the city 
may have for enforcement of this article.

approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support 
structure at the cost of the provider. 
The city shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or 
application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the documentation to the 
applicant on or before the day the city denies an application. 
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the revised 
application once within 30 days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying 
an additional application fee. The city shall approve or deny the revised application within 
30 days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to 
resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the application to 
submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement of the city's review 
period. 
The applicant must notify the city in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted 
activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the revised application. 
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. 
However, this revised application does not apply if the cure requires the review of a new 
location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless 
equipment associated with the small wireless facility. 
e. ?Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved permit to collocate a small 
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the city and the applicant shall enter into a 
Master Pole Attachment Agreement, provided by the city for the initial collocation on a 
municipal utility pole by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a 
small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the city and the applicant shall enter into a 
license supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement. 
(3) ?Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the city shall 
determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is 
incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be 
deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all 
documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in the city's permit application form 
are submitted by the applicant to the city. 
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the city sends the notice of incompleteness to the 
time the applicant provides the missing information. 
(4) ?Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by: 
a. ?An express written agreement by both the applicant and the city; or 
b. ?A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes the delay. 
(5) ?Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the 
jurisdiction of the city shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated 
application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if 
the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and 
substantially the same type of structure. 
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the City may remove small wireless 
facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations 
for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated 
treatment or that are denied. The city may issue separate permits for each collocation that is 
approved in a consolidated application. 
(6) ?Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, 
and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the city makes a finding that the 
small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable city 
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this article. 
If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be subject to 
the applicable city code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of renewal. 
(7) ?Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information 
and notices to the city by personal delivery at the city's designated place of business, by regular 
mail postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including electronic 
mail. 
(c) ?Collocation requirements and conditions. 
(1) ?Public safety space reservation. The city may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future 
public safety uses, for the city's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not 
preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the city reasonably determines that 
the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
(2) ?Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its 
small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the 
requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its 
employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities 
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental 
standards and regulations. 
(3) ?No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's 
operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public 
safety agency for public safety communications. 
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not 
cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry 
standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety 
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given 
written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own 
expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and 
resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC 
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the 
wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous 
paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public 
nuisance. 
(4) ?The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on city utility poles that are part 
of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone 
of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the 
communications space on the city utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise 
unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of 
the pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space," "communication worker 
safety zone," and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National 
Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(5) ?The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or 
regulations that concern public safety. 
(6) ?The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable 
for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that 
are set forth in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, a comprehensive plan or 
other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a 
historic landmark or in a historic district. 
(7) ?Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions 
section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any 
specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna 
systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a 
small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the city may propose that the small 
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure 
within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to 
use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and 
structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the 
applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the applicant shall provide written 
certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate 
location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(8) ?Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten 
feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is 
collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities 
are collocated may not exceed the higher of:

voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one 
percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before 
the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable

liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment 
was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid 
and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the 
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any 
additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this

valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax 
administrator shall:

(2) ?Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and 
(3) ?Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

provision unless the repeal is made by explicit reference to the specific adopted provision by title or 
numerical designation. In case of a direct conflict between the ordinance so passed and an adopted 
provision, the operation of one of the provisions shall be temporarily suspended in accordance with the

or anticipated cost to the city, not to exceed $65.00 per towing. The cost per towing may be 
determined as a just portion of the city's total cost or anticipated cost for towing during a snow 
removal operation rather than on a case-by-case basis if the chief of police determines that the 
number of towings or anticipated towings makes a case-by-case cost determination impractical. 
(f) ?The police department shall keep records of each such towing, including the license number of the 
vehicle, if any; the date and time, place and location of towing; and any other information required by 
the chief of police. The public works department shall cooperate with the police department in 
furnishing such information. 
(g) ?The police department may settle and compromise violations of this section in accordance with the 
provisions of section 110-221. 
(h) ?Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize parking in an area where such parking would 
otherwise be restricted or prohibited. 
(Code 1982, § 74.09) 


Sec. 110-196. - Parking in downtown area. 
(a) ?Parking for any vehicle (in any marked parking space) on the streets in the city shall be restricted to 
a two-hour period during the hours from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Additional 
parking restrictions are set forth in section 110-198 below. Parking in municipally owned parking lots 
is restricted to a two hour period during the hours from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through 
Saturday unless different periods are provided elsewhere in this Code. 
(b) ?Any vehicle displaying a valid handicapped parking decal issued pursuant to 11-1301.2 of the 
Illinois Vehicle Code as amended (625 ILCS 5/11-1301.2) or a valid handicapped parking license 
plate issued pursuant to 3-616 of the Illinois Vehicle Code as amended (625 ILCS 5/3- 616) is 
hereby exempt from the two-hour parking time restriction described in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Code 1982, § 74.10; Ord. No. 931F, § 2, 1-17-95; Ord. No. 151H, § 1, 5-21-12) 


Sec. 110-197. - Exemption from parking provisions. 
    The provisions of this article regulating the movement or parking of vehicles shall not apply to 
emergency vehicles while the driver thereof is engaged in the performance of emergency duties. Nor 
shall such provisions apply to persons actually engaged in repairing or otherwise improving the streets 
under authority of the city council or of the state. 
(Code 1982, § 74.11)

(d) ?Unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty or administrative fee imposed 
under this article which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of the deadline to seek 
judicial review under the administrative review law may be enforced in the same manner as a 
judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 114-34. - Water and sewer tap-on inspection charge. 
    There is hereby established the charge of $100.00 as the fee payable to the city for its inspection of 
the physical tap-in to either the water or the sewerage system of the city. Such charge shall not be part of 
the connection charge authorized by statute but shall merely defray the cost to the city for employing and 
maintaining personnel to carry out the inspection of tap-in connection into either its water or its sewerage 
system. The fee shall be uniform with regard to each physical connection into either system without 
regard to the size of the connection or the number or type of units which the single connection shall 
serve. This fee may be waived by the director of public works if an engineer's review is utilized pursuant 
to the subdivision code of the city. 
(Code 1982, § 55.04) 


Sec. 114-35. - Establishing a connection fee and subclasses thereof. 
(a) ?Fee established; when assessed; determination. Pursuant to authority granted in the 65 ILCS 5/11-
150-1, as amended, and upon authority contained in other provisions of the state statutes, there is 
hereby established within the city a charge for connecting into the waterworks or sewerage or 
combined systems of the city. Such charge is to be assessed against new or additional users of the 
sewage collection and treatment system or the water system of the city and shall be known as the 
"connection charge." The charge shall be payable at the time a building or connection permit is 
issued or at the time of preliminary plat approval on those properties where an engineer's review is 
utilized pursuant to the subdivision code of the city. Payment of the connection charge may be 
delayed or amended by a two-thirds vote of the city council members holding office. Contained within 
the "connection charge" are a number of subcharges or subcategories. In some instances, the 
charge established shall be a sum fixed within this article. In other instances, such charge shall be 
based upon the cost to the city of the extension of a particular part of the system. In some instances, 
a subcharge may be based upon the volume and strength of the proposed usage. If the building 
plans are not susceptible to an accurate estimate of the volume and strength of the usage, the 
person desiring to make the connection shall pay that portion of the fee based upon the most 
accurate estimate that can be made upon the plan submitted. At the time the sewer and/or water 
connection is in full use, a reevaluation of the volume and strength of the usage shall be made and 
an adjustment of the fee shall be applied. Such reevaluation shall be made within one year of the 
date at which the operation, in the opinion of the director of public works, shall have reached its full 
use. The connection charge shall be determined by adding together the subcharges that are 
applicable to the particular new or additional user of the system. There shall be three subcharges, 
the sum of which shall constitute the total connection fee for entrance into the water and/or sewer 
system. The three subcharges shall be known as: 
(1) ?The water connection tap-on fee; 
(2) ?The sewer connection tap-on fee; and 
(3) ?The water and sewer expansion and extension connection fee. 
(b) ?Water connection tap-on fee. 
(1) ?The water connection tap-on fee shall be based upon the size of the water tap made into the 
water system. This fee is intended to reimburse the city for a portion of the water system 
previously created by the city into which the user now seeks to connect. The schedule of taps 
and charges shall be as shown in section 114-36. 
(2) ?The charges for tapping into the water system of the city that are larger than 12 inches in 
diameter, or for properties located outside of the corporate limits and which the city at its 
absolute discretion wishes to allow to tap into the city system, shall be determined on an 
individual basis by the mayor and city council. The corporate authorities in reaching such a 
decision shall seek the opinion of the director of public works with regard to the proportionate 
cost to the city in producing and transporting the volume of water through existing facilities 
required by the user. 
(3) ?The water connection tap-on fee charge described above pertains to each single-family, 
commercial or industrial connection. In the event any particular building or premises shall 
contain more than one dwelling, there shall be an additional water connection tap-on fee of an 
amount equal to the fee for a three-quarter-inch water connection for each additional residential 
dwelling unit to be served. A residential dwelling unit is defined as one or more rooms designed 
or used as living quarters for one family only. 
(c) ?Sewer connection tap-on fee. 
(1) ?The sewer connection tap-on fee shall be based upon the size of the water tap made into the 
water system. This fee is intended to reimburse the city for a portion of the sewer system 
previously created by the city into which the user now seeks to connect. The schedule of taps 
and charges shall be as shown in section 114-36. 
(2) ?The charges for tapping into the sewerage system of the city that has a water connection larger 
than 12 inches in diameter, or for properties located outside the corporate limits and which the 
city at its absolute discretion shall agree to provide sewage treatment service to an area outside 
of its corporate limits, the sewer connection tap-on fee for such user or users shall be 
determined on an individual basis by the mayor and city council. The corporate authorities in 
reaching such a decision shall seek the opinion of the director of public works with regard to the 
proportionate cost to the city in transporting and treating the volume of sewage through existing 
facilities required by the user. 
(3) ?The charges described above, except as otherwise provided, pertain to each single-family, 
commercial or industrial connection. In the event any particular building or premises shall 
contain more than one dwelling unit, there shall be an additional sewer connection tap-on fee of 
an amount equal to the fee for a three-quarter-inch sewer connection for each additional 
residential unit to be served. A residential dwelling unit is defined as one or more rooms which 
are designed or used as living quarters for one family only. 
(d) ?Water and sewer expansion and extension connection fee. 
(1) ?The water and sewer expansion and extension connection fee is hereby established to 
reimburse the city for its costs in extending sewer and water lines to serve new and additional 
users and to increase its capacity to produce and transport water and to transport and treat 
sewage. The city may provide, at its own initial expense, for the drilling of wells and the 
construction of expansions and extensions of its water supply system and for the increase in 
size of its sewage treatment plant and the extension and expansion of its sewer mains to certain 
areas within the city. In so doing, the city seeks to provide a material benefit to the property 
owners abutting such improvements and to encourage the development of such property. To 
reimburse the city for the funds so expended, the city has created a water and sewer expansion 
and extension connection fee. Such fee shall be based upon the pro rata share of the cost of 
exploration, construction and extension, which cost was required to provide the sewer and 
water services being made available to the new or additional user. The water and sewer 
expansion and extension connection fee shall be based upon all such costs, including but not 
limited to engineering fees, supervision, legal fees, land costs and construction. 
(2) ?When a new or additional user of the system wishes to connect into the sewer and/or water 
system of the city, he shall request from the director of public works an estimate of the sum of 
the water and sewer expansion and extension connection fee attributable to the property which 
he wishes to serve with municipal utilities. Within ten days after such application, the director of 
public works shall certify to such applicant the then-current amount of the water and sewer 
expansion and extension connection fee attributable to the property sought to be served. In 
arriving at the water and sewer expansion and extension connection fee, the director of public 
works may request such information from the applicant as shall be reasonably necessary in 
order that he may compute the amount of the fee. He shall, for example, be allowed to inquire 
as to the use which the applicant desires to make of the land. Any water and sewer expansion 
and extension connection fee so certified by the city shall remain in effect for a period of 60 
days and may, at the option of the city, be further extended. After such 60-day period, if the 
connection fee has not been paid, the city may recompute the amount of such connection fee. 
In arriving at a recomputed figure, the director of public works shall consider any additional cost 
incurred by the city in providing the sewer and/or water services desired by the applicant. If an 
applicant should disagree with or dispute the amount of the water and sewer expansion and 
extension connection fee, in whole or in part, as determined by the director of public works, he 
shall be allowed to appeal such decision to the city council. The city shall allow the applicant to 
appear before it, either at a regular or special city council meeting or otherwise, to present his 
objections to the estimate of costs. The city council may require the director of public works to 
appear before it to explain the manner in which such connection fee has been computed. The 
decision of the city council regarding this matter shall be final. 
(e) ?Disposition of revenue. 
(1) ?The revenue received by the city from the tap-on inspection charges shall be deposited into the 
sewer and water operations and maintenance funds of the city. 
(2) ?The revenue received by the city from the water connection tap-on fee, the sewer connection 
tap-on fee, and the water and sewer expansion and extension connection fee, shall be used by 
the city for its general corporate purposes, with primary application thereof being made to the 
necessary expansion of the works of the system to meet the requirements of new or additional 
users thereof; such funds shall be placed, until they are used, into a fund, which shall be known 
as the water and sewer system improvement funds. The moneys to the credit of such fund may 
be invested from time to time by the treasurer of the city as provided by law. All accrued interest 
on any investments shall be credited to such fund. 
(f) ?Acceptance of donations in lieu of fees. The city may accept a donation of construction, expansion 
or extension of the works of its system in lieu of all or part of the connection charges established by 
this article. 
(Code 1982, § 55.05)

(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-303. - Building sewer and connections. 
(a) ?Permit requirements. No person shall construct a new wastewater source or alter, repair or 
reconstruct an existing source and connect same to the wastewater facilities of the city without first 
making application for the privilege of making said connection to the city. 
(1) ?No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with, or opening into; use, alter, 
or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from 
the public works department of the city, with sign-off by the DPW and receipt of an IEPA permit 
when required under 35 IAC 309. 
(2) ?No addition to or alteration of any building sewer shall be made or caused to be made by any 
person without a permit from the building department and then only through a sewer contractor. 
A sign-off from the DPW is required prior to the issuance of the permit. No permit shall authorize 
anything not explicitly stated in the application. 
(3) ?The sanitary sewer connection permit is included with the building permit. A user will secure a 
building permit if the waste source is for new equipment to be installed in an existing with an 
existing sewer connection. The owner or his agent shall make application on a special form 
furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, 
or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the building official and the DPW. A 
sign-off from the DPW is required for all sewer connections. A permit and inspection fee as 
defined in division 5 of article V shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed. 
(4) ?All disposal by any person into the sanitary sewer system is unlawful except those discharges 
in compliance with federal standards promulgated pursuant to the Federal Act, the Illinois 
Environmental Protection Act and regulations promulgated thereto, and the city Code. 
(5) ?Persons desiring to construct a new waste source and connect it to the wastewater facilities of 
the city shall state the quantity, quality and rate of discharge into the public sewer or treatment 
works. A non-residential user, as a condition of permit authorization, must provide information 
describing its wastewater constituents, characteristics and type of activity per section 114-311 
of this division. In the case of any fraudulent representation upon the part of the user, the permit 
fees will be forfeited and the use of the sewer stopped. 
(6) ?A building sewer permit will only be issued and a sanitary sewer connection shall only be 
allowed if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewage facilities, including sewers, 
pump stations and wastewater treatment works, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately 
and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load based on the population equivalent. 
(7) ?A user will also secure a building permit if the waste source is for new equipment to be installed 
in an existing building with an existing sewer connection. 
(8) ?Each excavation for any of the purposes set out in this subsection shall require a separate 
permit, pursuant to the building code. 
(9) ?All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be 
borne by the applicant. The person installing the building sewer for the owner shall be a 
licensed plumber or sewer contractor and he shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the 
city from loss or damage that may directly or indirectly occasioned by said installation. Before a 
building sewer permit is issued, the plumber or sewer contractor shall file with the DPW a right-
of-way bond and an indemnity bond with corporate surety licensed to do business in the State 
of Illinois, on bond forms supplied by the city. In addition, thereto, the plumber or sewer 
contractor shall file with the DPW a certificate of insurance covering public liability for bodily 
injury and property damage naming the city as an additional insured. 
(10) ?The building sewer connection permit will be issued for a period of 24 months consistent with 
the IEPA permits. 
(11) ?Any permit issued in this section may be revoked in accordance with division 9 of article V. 
(b) ?Building sewer connections (lateral line connections). 
(1) ?A separate and independent building sewer or lateral line shall be provided for every building, 
except that where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private 
sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, 
yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building 
and the whole considered as one building sewer and may be done only with the explicit 
approval of the building official. In no case shall any owner be permitted to maintain, without the 
consent of the building official, any connection of a building drain to a building sewer located 
across or under the property of another. 
(2) ?An existing building sewer may be used in connection with new buildings only when it is found, 
on examination and test by the building official or pretreatment coordinator or his designee, to 
meet all requirements of this division. All costs for this examination shall be borne by the 
applicant. 
(3) ?The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer and the methods to be 
used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all 
conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes or other applicable rules and 
regulations of the city. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the 
materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society of 
Testing Materials, Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9, and Standard 
Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois shall apply. If any connection 
violates the rules and specifications, the city may, in addition to any other penalty or remedy 
available, refuse to issue, revoke or cancel any permit, including but not limited to building 
permits and certificates of occupancy. Additionally, in the event that an existing connection is 
found to violate the rules and specifications the city may disconnect said connection and assess 
the cost thereof to the property owner. 
(4) ?When authorized by the DPW, low pressure systems (LPS) may be used for discharge of 
domestic wastes from the building to drain to the public sewer. All pump stations used to 
discharge domestic wastes will be furnished complete and factory built. Stations will consist of a 
semi-positive displacement grinder pump(s) suitably mounted in a basin constructed of high 
density polyethylene (HDPE), pump removal system, shut-off valve, anti-siphon valve, check 
valve assembled within the basin and all necessary internal wiring and controls. For ease of 
service, all pump-motor/grinder units shall be of like type and horsepower. 
(5) ?No sanitary sewer shall exceed 12 feet in depth below grade without the prior written approval 
from the DPW. The DPW shall not approve any sanitary sewer at a depth greater than 12 feet 
unless, after a review of all plans and engineering, he is satisfied that the proposed depth will 
not be detrimental to the sanitary sewer and water system, will not place an additional burden 
upon the city for maintenance of the system and that the increased depth of the system is in the 
best interests of the city and the surrounding property owners. 
(c) ?Building sewer construction requirements. Construction of a building sewer may not be started until 
fees are paid consistent with section 114-304 of this division and a written permit is issued by the city 
after issuance and receipt of an IEPA permit for the project when applicable. It shall be unlawful to 
extend any sewer main to be so connected in order to serve additional buildings without payment to 
the city of an additional sewer connection fee for each such additional building or unit within said 
building. The following conditions are also required: 
(1) ?The applicant shall secure a permit from the building official when appropriate in conformance 
with the provisions of the building code. 
(2) ?All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and 
lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public 
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the 
city. Failure to properly barricade will be cause for the job site to be shut down and a fee as 
provided in division 5 of article V must be paid before any further work can commence. 
(3) ?The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the building official two city business 
days prior to the start of any underground piping installation and when the building sewer is 
ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under 
the supervision of a qualified duly authorized agent of the city during regular city working hours. 
(4) ?Sewer service lines shall not be connected to manholes for residential users. All sanitary sewer 
service lines serving single-family residences shall have "blind" connections to the sewer main 
(as stated in paragraph (c) section (8)). Only exceptions are when homes are located in a cul-
de-sac and the connection to the sewer main would be impractical. This exception must be 
approved by the DPW. 
(5) ?Whenever possible, the lateral line shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the 
basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is either too low to permit gravity flow 
to the sewer main or lower than one foot above the crown of the adjacent street, sanitary 
sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to 
the interference in order to there from permit gravity flow to the sanitary sewer system. 
(6) ?All low pressure systems will have a minimum one and one-fourth-inch diameter discharge 
pipe. All services will be installed complete including a combination curb stop/check valve 
assembly with curb box, marked sewer on the cap, located five feet outside the property line in 
the public right-of-way. All fittings and valves shall be rated at 150 psi working pressure. All LPS 
piping shall be buried a minimum of 54 inches below the finished ground surface. 
(d) ?Sanitary sewer uses outside of the corporate limits of the city. There are existing agreements for 
sanitary sewer uses outside the corporate limits of the city. No new permit shall be issued for the 
tapping into or use of sanitary sewer facility under the jurisdiction of the city for any location outside 
of the corporate limits of the city unless approved by the city council. Costs and expenses to retain 
independent review by a consulting engineer for issues arising from potential connections shall be at 
the expense of the property owner. 
(e) ?Sewer installation acceptance. 
(1) ?At a minimum, a one-year warranty will be submitted to the city by the contractor doing the 
sewer installation against all defects including poor workmanship, improper installation, 
restoration items (turf, sidewalk, pavement, etc.) or material failure. The warranty will require the 
contractor to correct any problems with the installation discovered during that one-year period. 
(2) ?The applicant for the permit shall notify the DPW and building department two city business 
days in advance when the lateral line is ready for inspection and connection to the sewer main. 
The DPW inspects the portion of the lateral line located within the public right-of-way and the 
building department inspects the portion located on private property. 
(3) ?Each and every part of a sewer connection shall be inspected and approved by the DPW and 
building department before being concealed or backfilled. 
It shall be unlawful to fill an excavation without having first received the written approval of the 
DPW and building department as provided in this division, and any person violating this 
provision shall (in addition to suffering upon conviction the fine herein imposed) expose the 
sewer for inspection by the DPW and building department at no cost to the city. 
(4) ?In any case, where the DPW and/or building department finds the work on any sewer not 
accomplished as herein provided, he shall serve written notice on the person to whom the 
permit is issued, stating wherein such work is deficient and ordering said person to remedy such 
defect within 24 hours. 
In the event such person fails to comply therewith, the inspector shall cause such defect to be 
corrected at the expense of the person to whom the permit was issued. 
(5) ?An inspection fee as identified in division 5 of article V, shall be paid to the city as a fee for 
each inspection made by the DPW and/or building department. 
(f) ?Maintenance and repair. The owner of the premises served by the sanitary sewer system shall 
properly maintain the operation and repair the building sewer or lateral line located on private 
property shall be the responsibility of the [owner]. The city owns and maintains the portion of the 
building sewer or lateral line located in the public right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-304. - Fees. 
    The following types of fees shall be charged when permitting and constructing a new wastewater 
source and connecting it the wastewater facilities of the city. All review, inspection and connection fees 
shall be based upon current fees identified in division 5 of article V and shall be reviewed and updated 
annually. 
(1) ?A review and connection fee for sewer permit shall be paid to the city at the time the residential 
application is filed. Non-residential fees will be based on an individual case basis measured by 
the impact of the application on the current POTW capacity. A minimum sanitary sewer 
connection fee shall be established for any non-residential users at four population equivalents 
(PE). The first inspection that is required for a service is separate from the review fee. Additional 
inspection fees shall be paid for additional inspections where a building official finds that the 
work on any sewer connection is deficient. 
(2) ?An inspection fee shall be paid for any additional inspections. This includes but is not limited to 
inspections of sampling manhole, common interceptors, flow metering or sampling equipment, 
garbage grinders, grease, oil and sand interceptors, and grease traps. A separate review fee 
may be charged based on the cost and expense to review equalization and/or pretreatment 
facilities required at a non-residential user. 
(3) ?A review fee shall be paid for review of any waiver requests allowed under section 114-343(f) 
in this Code. 
(4) ?Connection permit fees. The fee for each sewer connection permit shall be in the amount set 
forth in appendix A. Such permit shall not be issued until the payment has been made to the city 
for the fees outlined in each subsection for each building to be served by means of such 
connection, and it shall be unlawful to extend any sewer main to be so connected in order to 
serve additional buildings without payment to the city of an additional sewer connection fee for 
each such building or unit within said building. 
(5) ?Connection fees involving non-residential strength wastewater. 
a. ?PE determination: 
1. ?The pretreatment coordinator may require non-residential users to report the 
concentrations and flow rates of wastewater discharged to the city sanitary sewer system. 
Flow rate averages will be calculated based on the number of actual days discharged. For 
wastewater the strength of which exceeds normal residential wastewater as defined as 
population equivalent in section 114-291 in this Code in any constituent, the fees shall be 
based as follows: 
i. ?A PE connection fee shall be calculated on the basis of the impact on the wastewater 
treatment works as the equivalent of the highest PE of the three parameters: flow, 
BOD or TSS. 
ii. ?In the event that the wastewater exhibits a ratio of COD to BOD that is greater than 
3.0, the BODPE will be calculated on the basis of 0.33 of the COD value. 
iii. ?The difference between the connection fee based on water meter size and the 
wastewater connection fee based on PE shall be identified as the strength connection. 
In the event that the PE connection fee is larger than the water meter size based 
connection fee, the strength connection fee will be added to the water meter size 
connection fee. 
2. ?When the volume and strength of the wastewater to be discharged to the public sanitary 
sewers is not known at the time of the connection, the fee shall be estimated and adjusted 
to reflect actual conditions during the billing period after a full year of operation of all 
equipment. 
3. ?The volume and strength of the wastewater for fee purposes shall be based on the 
maximum actual daily discharge of constituents. 
4. ?When a connection is made based on the applicant's statement that the strength of the 
wastewater does not exceed residential wastewater in any constituent, and normally at the 
end of the billing period after a full year of operation of all equipment, it is determined that 
the wastewater does exceed residential wastewater in strength, the pretreatment 
coordinator and DPW may accept or reject the wastewater and back-charge the applicant 
for fees plus applicable penalties for the non-residential wastewater or have the service 
disconnected and the premises closed. 
5. ?The pretreatment coordinator may review non-residential users flow and loadings on an 
intermittent frequency, normally every two years, to identify increases to the baseline PE. 
The pretreatment coordinator and building official may bill the non-residential user, for 
increases to the baseline, a connection fee as defined in division 5 of article V. On 
payment of the fee, the property baseline shall be adjusted to the newly established PE. 
(6) ?Properties outside corporate limits. The connection fee calculated for any user not located 
within the corporate limits of the city is listed in appendix A. On payment of the fee, the property 
baseline shall be adjusted to the newly established PE. 
(7) ?All review inspection and connection fees are set forth in appendix A and may be reviewed 
from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-305. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a) ?Sampling manhole applicability. 
(1) ?All non-residential users are required to install a sampling manhole for each separate 
discharge in the building sewer in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the 
city and section 114-305 of this Code. 
When required by the city, a significant industrial user (SIU) or non-significant regulated user 
(NSRU), that does not have a unique sampling chamber at end-of-pipe, shall install a sampling 
manhole or sampling chamber for use as the regulation location of local limits in the building 
sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city. This sampling chamber 
may be required to be installed within the building. 
(2) ?When required by the city, a categorical industrial user shall install a sampling manhole or 
sampling chamber for use as the regulation location of the categorically regulated discharge in 
the building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city. This 
sampling chamber may be required to be installed within the building and may be in addition to 
an end-of-pipe sampling manhole. 
(3) ?In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist, the "sampling manhole" shall be 
considered to be either the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at 
which the building sewer is connected or the point of process wastewater discharge if 
accessible by the city. 
(b) ?An inspection fee as provided in appendix A shall be paid to the city prior to issuance of the permit 
should it be determined that the user is required to install any of the following structures: 
(1) ?Sampling manhole requirements. All users located in areas zoned industrial park and such 
other users as required by the pretreatment coordinator, except residential users, are required 
to install a sampling manhole for each separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance 
with the plans and specifications approved by the building official. Each manhole shall be 
situated on the user's premises in an easement dedicated to the city. 
The sampling manhole shall be located on the sewer connection pipe at a point where there are 
no changes in grade or alignment for at least five feet upstream and downstream from the 
manhole. The grade (slope) of the pipe shall not exceed one percent (one foot per 100 feet) 
through the manhole and for a distance of five feet upstream and downstream from the 
manhole. 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to allow accurate sampling and 
preparation of samples for analysis. The manhole shall be installed and maintained by the 
owner/user at his or her sole expense so as to be safe and accessible to the city at all times. 
The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for 
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
a. ?Where such a sampling manhole location would be impractical or cause extreme hardship 
on the user, the pretreatment coordinator may concur with the manhole being constructed 
in the public right-of-way provided that the manhole is located so that it shall not be 
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. If a sampling manhole is located in a parking 
lot, a permanent barricade, such as a vertical pipe shall be placed around the manhole to 
prevent vehicles from driving or parking over the sampling manhole cover. 
b. ?The pretreatment coordinator and building official may postpone the installation of the 
sampling manhole when specific circumstances (e.g., weather) prevent the installation of a 
manhole. 
c. ?When a postponement for a sampling manhole installation is granted by the city, a bond 
shall be posted and an affidavit will be signed by the property owner to install the sampling 
manhole at a later date should business practices change at the location where the 
manhole installation was postponed. 
d. ?The pretreatment coordinator may determine sub-classes of business that do not require 
the installation of sampling manholes and will advise the building official of such sub-
classes. Sampling manholes will always be required in zoned industrial parks. 
(2) ?Liquid quantity measurements. All significant industrial users may be required to install an open 
channel flow measuring device in said sampling manhole. when required, the sampling 
chamber shall contain a palmer-bowlus or parshall flume or equivalent, unless a weir or similar 
device is approved by the city. 
The city may, at its option, based on the water usage and/or waste loadings, require the user to 
install a device with a recording and totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity. 
The device shall include a circular chart recorder, suitable to record seven calendar days of flow 
or provide a computerized chart that is acceptable to the city. The equipment required to 
indicate, record and totalize the flow shall be located in a warm dry location and be accessible 
to the city for reading. This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at his sole 
expense. Should the requirement be made, the user shall complete installation of the flume and 
secondary flow measuring device based on the installation schedule approved for such device 
by the city. 
The user shall be required to calibrate and maintain the flow metering equipment in accordance 
with the manufacturer's recommended procedures and frequencies. Users who operate flow 
measuring devices will submit the procedure for operation and maintenance (O&M) to the city. 
The user shall further document O&M in a log which shall be available for inspection by city 
personnel. At minimum, the user shall submit a semi-annual calibration report performed by an 
outside representative by the deadline defined in the user's discharge permit. The user may be 
required to submit flow records to the pretreatment coordinator monthly. 
(3) ?Sampling equipment. The city may, at its option, based on water usage and/or waste loadings 
or when the waste loads cannot be accurately evaluated by time composite samples, require 
the user to install sampling equipment. This equipment shall be installed and maintained by the 
user at his sole expense. 
Users shall submit the procedure for O&M to the city. The user shall further document O&M in a 
log which shall be available for inspection by city personnel. At minimum, the user shall submit 
an annual report confirming the accurate operation of the equipment performed by an outside 
representative by the deadline defined in the user's discharge permit. 
(c) ?Wastewater monitoring and/or flow measurement facility operation and maintenance. 
(1) ?Such facilities will be installed and maintained at all times at the user's expense. The failure of 
a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to 
claim that the sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. Installation will be consistent 
with the requirements of this section. 
(2) ?The sampling manhole located on a building sewer discharge located in dedicated easements 
shall be easily accessible to representatives of the city 24 hours per day, seven days per week. 
(3) ?The sampling manhole at a discharge location within the building shall be accessible to 
representatives of the city. 
(4) ?Metered water supply may be used to determine wastewater flow if it is substantiated to the city 
that the metered water supply and wastewater quantities are approximately the same, or where 
an adjustment agreed to by the city is made in the metered water supply to determine 
wastewater flow which is documented through the use of sub-meters and/or production records. 
In the event that the wastewater flow cannot be substantiated at any regulated location to the 
satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator, the user will be required to install flow monitoring 
consistent with this section. 
(5) ?The sampling manhole, flow metering device, sampling equipment and documentation of the 
frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analysis of samples shall be subject, at any 
reasonable time, to inspection by the city.

discharged to the public sewer. Wastes classified as properly shredded garbage contain all 
particles being carried freely under the flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with 
no particle greater than one-half inch (1.27 centimeters) in any dimension. The installation and 
operation of any garbage grinder equipped, with a motor of three-fourths horsepower (0.76 hp 
metric) or greater shall be subject to review and approval of the city. The discharge of grinders 
is prohibited to be connected to a grease interceptor. 
(2) ?Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. Interceptors shall be provided in services connected to the 
city where it is determined that they are necessary for the proper handling of the wastewater 
containing excessive amounts of grease, oil, and sand except that such interceptors shall not be 
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interception units shall be of type and 
capacity approved by the city and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and 
inspection. They shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt 
and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and 
equipped with easily removable covers that when bolted in place shall be gastight and 
watertight. Oil and sand interceptors used for petroleum, grease and oils may be located inside

device discharging polluting substances, to any storm sewer or stormwater drainage 
system within the corporate limits of the city. 
b. ?Discharge of sanitary and industrial waste into storm drainage systems prohibited, 
nuisance declared. For reasons of the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the 
inhabitants of the city, it is the declared policy of the city to prohibit sanitary and industrial 
waste from entering into the stormwater drainage system, and any such connection to the 
stormwater drainage system is determined to be injurious to the public health and welfare 
and is hereby declared a public nuisance. 
c. ?Prohibited discharges into natural outlets. It shall be unlawful to discharge into any natural 
outlet within the city or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, any sanitary sewage, 
industrial wastes or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been 
provided in accordance with subsequent provisions of this article. 
(6) ?Requirements of unpolluted discharges. 
a. ?Discharge of sump pumps. A sump pump or sump pumps must discharge into a storm 
sewer system; or with the prior written permission of the director of public works (DPW) or 
other public works department employee may discharge outside a building in an area first 
approved by the DPW. A shut-off value or similar device which can divert the unpolluted 
discharge from the sump pump into the sanitary sewer system, rather than into the storm 
sewer system, or vice versa, shall not be constructed or installed, and any construction or 
installation of same shall be deemed a violation of this article. It shall be prima facie 
evidence of a violation of this article if any person or user has on his premises or under his 
control a sump pump, or any other pump, fixture, or gravity drain connected to the sanitary 
sewer system which would allow the flow of unpolluted water into the sanitary sewer 
system.

other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically 
designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the DPW. Industrial cooling 
waters or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, upon approval by the 
pretreatment coordinator and the IEPA if appropriate, to a storm sewer or natural outlet. 
c. ?Discharge of unpolluted discharges upon adjacent property or public streets or ways 
prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person or user to discharge any stormwater, surface 
water, ground water, roof runoff, or subsurface drainage, including the use of a sump pump 
for such purpose in such manner as to cause waters to overflow onto adjacent property or 
to be discharged upon any public street or public way. 
(7) ?Storm sewers. Storm and surface water runoff as outlined in section 114-301(f) of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-323. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
    The pretreatment requirement shall apply to all non-residential users subject to national categorical 
pretreatment standards, promulgated by the USEPA in accordance with section 307(b) and (c) of the Act, 
currently discharging or scheduled to discharge to the city. The national categorical pretreatment 
standards, found in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405—471 are hereby incorporated into this 
division. 
    Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge from the process regulated 
by the standard or as otherwise specified by the standard. Compliance with national categorical 
pretreatment standards is mandatory. The national categorical standards may be contained in the IEPA 
operating permit. 
(1) ?Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the 
concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent 
concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c) unless specifically restricted 
by the categorical pretreatment standard. These equivalent limitations calculated in accordance 
with the following requirements are deemed pretreatment standards. Users shall be required to 
comply with the equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from 
which the equivalent limitations were derived. An alternative pretreatment limit shall not be used 
if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants. 
(2) ?When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of 
pollutant per unit production, the city may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed 
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of 
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users. 
The city calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations shall calculate such limitations by 
multiplying the limits in the standard by the user's average rate of production. This average rate 
of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity, but rather upon a 
reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term daily production during a representative 
year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production. 
The city calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall calculate such limitations by 
dividing the mass limitations by the average daily flow rate of the user's regulated process 
wastewater. This average daily flow rate must be based upon a reasonable measure of the 
user's actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the 
representative year. 
(3) ?When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not 
regulated by the same standard, the pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit 
using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) provided that the regulation 
allows the wastewaters to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to allow 
issuance of an alternative limit. 
(4) ?A user may request a variance from USEPA based on fundamentally different factors. The 
request must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13. 
(5) ?A user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in 
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(6) ?When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant 
concentrations, a user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The 
determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the 
pretreatment coordinator. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the user meets 
all the conditions set forth in Sections a.1. through a.5. below. 
a. ?To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the user must: 
1. ?Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and 
technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its individual 
wastewater discharge permit; 
2. ?Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance 
with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a 
substitute for treatment; 
3. ?Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate 
for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring 
device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual 
average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be 
representative of current operating conditions; 
4. ?Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly 
that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5. ?Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards 
during the period prior to the user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b. ?A user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1. ?Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to 
achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2. ?Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow 
monitoring device; 
3. ?Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the pretreatment 
coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent 
from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph a.3. of this section. Upon 
notification of a revised production rate, the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the 
equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions 
at the facility; and 
4. ?Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and 
technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph a.1. of this section so long 
as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c. ?When developing equivalent mass limits, the pretreatment coordinator: 
1. ?Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow 
rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the concentration-based daily 
maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment 
standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2. ?Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit 
and recalculate the limit necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3. ?May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater 
discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely 
as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, 
and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the 
equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for 
treatment pursuant to section 114-322(2) in this Code. 
(7) ?The pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment 
standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating 
limitations applicable to individual users. The conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment 
coordinator. 
(8) ?Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must comply with the equivalent 
limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical pretreatment 
standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(9) ?Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily 
discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day 
average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow 
figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations. 
(10) ?Any user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits 
calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the pretreatment coordinator within two 
city business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will 
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the pretreatment 
coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits 
in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
    All users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards are required to file reports as 
required in this division, signed by an authorized representative per sections 114-452 and 114-453 of this 
Code. These reports shall include all information that the city deems necessary to make compliance 
determinations.

effluent from the sewer system or treatment plant to exceed 0.0005 mg/l of mercury. 
e. ?No person shall cause or allow any discharge of mercury to a publicly owned or publicly 
regulated sewer system which, alone or in combination with other sources, causes a 
violation by the sewer treatment plant discharge of the water quality standard of 35 IAC 
302 for mercury applicable in the receiving stream. 
f. ?For purposes of permit issuance, the IEPA may consider application of the exception of 
subsection b. or c. to determine compliance with this section. The IEPA may impose permit 
conditions necessary or required to assure continued application of the exception. When 
subsection b. or c. applies, the IEPA may impose an effluent limitation in the permit which 
allows the discharge of a concentration of mercury greater than 0.0005 mg/l but not more

F) for a period of 30 minutes, except as permitted by subsection b. below. 
b. ?Upon application by a county, municipality, sanitary district or public utility and approval by 
the IEPA, based upon determination by the IEPA that no violation of the effluent standards 
of 35 IAC 304 will result and that no hazard to workers in such sewage works will result, 
limited additional amounts of cyanide exceeding the standards in subsection a. above may 
be discharged to the sewage works of such county, sanitary district, municipality or public 
utility. 
c. ?Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority of any county, 
municipality, sanitary district or public utility to impose any more stringent standards or 
limitations on cyanide discharges to its sewage works. 
d. ?Any actions undertaken pursuant to subsection b. above shall be subject to the limitations 
of 35 IAC 307.2400(b)(7).

(a) ?The city reserves the right to establish, by article or in wastewater discharge permits or general 
permits, more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the 
purpose of this division. The specific limitations on discharge listed in section 114-325 of this division 
are derived from the maximum allowable industrial loading (MAIL) calculation. The MAILs are 
allocated only to those IUs, at the city's discretion, that contribute the regulated pollutant and all 
remaining IUs are held to either the background concentration or slightly higher than background but 
lower than the specific discharge limit. In no case shall the total of all allocations exceed the MAIL. 
(b) ?The city will maintain a reserve of the maximum allowable headworks pollutant loading for each 
pollutant for new industries or increase with existing industries. The city will recalculate the maximum 
concentrations from time to time using site specific data taking into consideration revisions to state 
and federal regulations that may impact the calculations. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-327. - Monitoring facilities and requirements. 
(a) ?Monitoring facilities. Monitoring facility requirements are outlined in section 114-305 of this Code. 
(b) ?Applicability. At minimum, all SIUs including categorical industrial users as well as NSRUs are 
required to sample based on the city monitoring frequency as stated in the wastewater discharge 
permit. Other users are required to sample upon the request of the city. The users shall pay the 
costs of sampling of its discharge and the costs of analyses of its samples, whether or not the 
sampling and analyses are done by the user or by the POTW. 
(c) ?Frequency. 
(1) ?All SIUs including categorical industrial users with wastewater discharge permits must sample 
their effluent consistent with the permit requirements and report the results to the POTW at least 
twice yearly for those parameters specified in the user's permit. The reporting requirement may 
be increased as defined in the permit for those parameters which have more frequent 
monitoring requirements. 
(2) ?Any NSRUs with an individual or general wastewater discharge permit shall sample their 
effluent and report the results to the POTW consistent with the requirements of the wastewater 
discharge permit and the city monitoring frequency. 
(3) ?The city shall have the right to perform its own sampling at any time at any location that has 
been issued a permit. 
(4) ?The city may initiate sampling and analyses at a higher frequency than in a wastewater 
discharge permit as a result of a violation of any discharge permit limit including cases where 
hot spot maintenance issues or blockage to the sanitary sewer system has occurred. 
(5) ?Cost of additional sampling and analyses for any monitoring will be invoiced to the applicable 
user. 
(d) ?Sample collection. 
(1) ?Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on representative 
conditions throughout the sampling and reporting period. The sampling data must be obtained 
using appropriate sampling and analysis criteria as defined in the wastewater discharge permit. 
(2) ?Except as indicated in subsection (d)(3) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 
flow proportional composite collection techniques. 
(3) ?In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the pretreatment coordinator may 
authorize the use of time proportional sampling at minimum collecting samples every 15 
minutes during a 24-hour workday; or a minimum of four grab samples. A single grab sample 
may be taken where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the 
effluent being discharged and the pretreatment coordinator approves this sample technique. A 
proportional number of samples shall be collected for wastewater discharges less than 24 
hours. 
(4) ?Single grab samples may be required in the event of an infrequent batch discharge or to show 
compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(5) ?Samples for fats, oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, hexavalent chromium, phenols, 
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using the number of grab samples 
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and 
requirements. Multiple grab samples that are individually preserved as specified in 40 CFR 136 
and appropriate USEPA guidance that are collected during a 24-hour period may be 
composited prior to the analysis, as follows: 
a. ?For cyanide, hexavalent chromium, phenols, and sulfides: multiple grab samples may be 
composited in the laboratory or in the field; 
b. ?For volatile organics and oil and grease: multiple grab samples may only be composited in 
the laboratory. 
(6) ?Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as 
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate.

provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and 
operating procedures shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator for review, and shall be 
acceptable to the pretreatment coordinator before such facilities are constructed. The review of such 
plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such 
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. 
    All users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements. Users shall obtain all necessary 
construction-operating permits from the IEPA prior to the city connection and/or discharge permit(s) being 
issued. IEPA will make the determination of actual permitting requirements based on changes in the 
wastewater volume or characteristics generated at the user site. The city will track and parallel this IEPA 
permitting process. No sources of non-residential wastewater will be allowed to discharge to city POTW 
until all permitting requirements have been satisfied. Such pretreatment facilities shall be under the 
control and direction of an IEPA-certified wastewater operator. 
    Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to the 
city and IEPA prior to the user's initiation of the changes. Users shall obtain all additional construction-
operating permits from IEPA and the city for the changes prior to discharge.

make unannounced inspections of any additional pretreatment measures during normal business hours 
whether the user has been issued an individual or general wastewater discharge permit or not. 
(1) ?Whenever deemed necessary, the pretreatment coordinator may require users to restrict their 
discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into 
specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste 
streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to 
protect the POTW works and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this 
division. 
(2) ?The pretreatment coordinator may require any person or user discharging into the POTW to 
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control 
facility to ensure equalization of flow. The city may issue an individual or general wastewater 
discharge permit solely for flow equalization. 
(3) ?Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and 
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

shall consist of a fixed charge for accounting, billing and auditing, a basic service charge 
indebtedness, operation and maintenance, plus equipment replacements, and buildings and 
structure depreciation. 
(b) ?The basic service charge shall be based on water usage, excluding usage metered by a sprinkler 
meter, as recorded by water meters and sewage meters for wastes having the following average 
domestic waste characteristics: 
(1) ?A five-day, 20 degrees Celsius BOD of 200 mg/l. 
(2) ?A total suspended solids content of 260 mg/l. 
(c) ?It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as 
follows: 
(1) ?Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater 
facilities, including an equipment replacement fund and building depreciation fund for the year, 
for all works categories. 
(2) ?Proportion the estimated costs for wastewater facility categories by volume, total suspended 
solids and BOD. 
(3) ?Compute costs per 100 cubic feet of domestic waste. 
(d) ?The adequacy of the service charge shall be reviewed annually by the certified public accountants 
for the city in their annual audit report. The service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a 
change in the number of users and in operation and maintenance costs, including depreciation and 
equipment replacement cost.

Sec. 114-352. - Measurement of flow. 
    The volume of flow used for computing basic service charges shall be the metered water 
consumption, excluding usage metered by a sprinkler meter. 
(1) ?If persons or other dischargers (industrial or commercial) discharging wastes into the public 
sewers procure any part or all of their water from sources other than the public waterworks 
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the dischargers shall, if 
directed by the city, install and maintain, at their expense, water meters of a type approved by 
the department of public works for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained 
from these other sources. 
(2) ?Dischargers manufacturing products that utilize water that does not reach the sewer system will 
be allowed a reduction in their water consumption reading if they can demonstrate (by meter 
reading or calculations) the volume not discharged to the sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-353. - Computation of service charge. 
    The service charge shall be computed by the following formula: 
CW = CM + (VU) CU

charge. Fees for these items are provided in appendix A of this Code. 
(1) ?Basic user charge. A basic user charge per billing shall be applied to each single metered or 
multiple unit served. The basic user charge may be referred to as a billing charge (based on the 
cost of billing). This charge shall apply to all users, whether located inside or outside the city 
limits, and whether or not contiguous to the city limits. In addition, each user with a sewer meter 
shall pay an annual sewer meter maintenance charge, which is based upon the cost of meter 
maintenance and calibration. The sewer meter maintenance fee shall be billed in either the 
February or March billing for the relevant user. 
(2) ?Basic user rate plus debt service. A basic user rate shall be applied to each user based upon 
metered water consumption to pay the cost of operation maintenance, and replacement of the 
system and debt service. 
(3) ?Surcharge. All commercial, industrial, and institutional/governmental users shall pay a 
surcharge in addition to the above charges whose discharges exceed the average 
concentrations for BOD 5 and/or total suspended solids as provided in section 114-351(b) of this 
division. In addition, surcharge will be assessed for total dissolved solids greater than 260 mg/l

DIVISION 6. - SURCHARGES AND OTHER COST RECOVERY 


Subdivision I. - Surcharge 


Sec. 114-370. - Surcharge. 


Sec. 114-371. - Cost recovery required. 
    Each industrial user shall pay that portion of the city's indebtedness and the operation, maintenance, 
equipment and depreciation costs for financing the annual costs of the wastewater treatment works. The 
user's share shall not include an interest component. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-372. - Basis for cost recovery charges. 
    An industrial user's portion of cost recovery charges shall be based on the volume and strength of 
wastewater discharged to the wastewater treatment works of the city less domestic waste discharges. 
This shall be determined based on the following parameters: 
(1) ?Volume. This value equals the average daily rate of water consumption as determined by the 
consumption records of the past year minus 25 gallons per employee per eight-hour shift for 
domestic waste or, where water consumption does not reflect the actual quantity of wastewater 
tributary to the treatment works from the user, the average daily flow as recorded in the control 
manhole required by section 114-384 of this division minus 25 gallons per employee per eight-
hour shift for domestic waste. 
(2) ?BOD. This value equals the average daily pounds of billable BOD in the wastewater as 
determined in section 114-384 of this division minus 0.0425 pound of BOD per employee per 
eight-hour shift for domestic waste. 
(3) ?Total suspended solids. This value equals the average daily pounds of total suspended solids 
in the wastewater from the user as determined in section 114-384 of this division minus 0.055 
pound of total suspended solids per employee per eight-hour shift for domestic waste. 
(4) ?Total dissolved solids or polar FOG. This value equals the average daily pounds of total 
dissolved solids or polar FOG in the wastewater from the user as determined in section 114-384 
of this division. 
(5) ?Flat rate. A flat rate charge per bill based on the supervisory, audit, billing and collecting costs 
and the number of bills issued per year. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-373. - Unit cost. 
    The dollar unit cost shall be determined as follows: 
(1) ?Volume. 
a. ?Annual cost proportioned to industrial volume discharged to the plant divided by metered 
water consumption by user multiplied by 100 cubic feet. Refer to appendix A for unit cost. 
b. ?Except that all industrial weak strength wastes shall be charged the domestic wastewater 
discharge rate in section 114-354(b) of this Code. Surcharges for BOD, total suspended 
solids or total dissolved solids, and polar FOG shall be charged to industrial discharges for 
waste strengths in excess of domestic waste. 
(2) ?BOD. Annual cost proportioned to BOD divided by pounds of BOD per year multiplied by 100 
pounds. Refer to appendix A for unit cost. 
(3) ?Total suspended solids. Annual cost proportioned to total suspended solids divided by pounds 
of total suspended solids per year multiplied by pounds of total suspended solids. Refer to 
appendix A for unit cost. 
(4) ?Total dissolved solids or polar FOG. Refer to appendix A for unit cost. 
(5) ?Annual cost. Annual cost for supervisory, audit, billing and collecting services is equal to the 
number of bills issues per year. Refer to appendix A for annual cost. 
(6) ?Annual fixed cost. Annual fixed cost, proportioned to property divided by assessed value of the 
real estate in the city multiplied by $1,000.00 assessed value. Refer to appendix A for annual 
fixed cost. 
(7) ?CU. Basic service rate for domestic waste discharge in section 114-354(b) of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-374. - Cost for industrial user. 
    The cost to be recovered from an industrial user (CI) shall be determined as follows: 
(1) ?CI is equal to volume multiplied by CU plus BOD plus total suspended solids plus total 
dissolved solids plus polar FOG plus Z. 
(2) ?CU is equal to basic service rate. 
(3) ?Volume is equal to cubic feet of waste discharged to plant per year. 
(4) ?BOD and total suspended solids is equal to BOD and total suspended solids in excess of 
domestic waste strength as outlined in section 114-351(b) of this Code. 
(5) ?Total dissolved solids and polar FOG in excess of levels outlined in section 114-354(b)(3) of 
this Code. 
(6) ?Z is equal to flat rate billing charge. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-375. - Charge for cost recovery. 
    Each year each industrial user of the treatment works shall pay the cost recovery amount determined 
by section 114-374 of this division. Where an industry is connected to a public sewer after the startup of 
the facilities constructed under a state or federal grant, the industry shall only pay its portion of the 
industrial waste cost recovery amount for each quarter during the use of the project. The industry will not 
be required to pay for those quarters prior to connection to a public sewer.

Sec. 114-377. - Delinquency and termination of service. 
    In the event the charges for industrial waste cost recovery are not paid within 30 days after the 
rendition of that bill, then service charges shall be deemed and are declared to be delinquent, and 
thereafter the delinquent charge shall constitute a lien on the real estate for which the sewer services 
were supplied. The city may file sworn statements showing the delinquencies in the office of the county 
recorder of deeds, and the filing of the statements shall be deemed notice of a lien for the payment of the 
charges for sewer service. If the delinquency in the payment of the recovery cost continues for a period of 
more than 20 days, the sewer service shall be discontinued. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-378. - Time of first payment.

deemed necessary by the director of public works for determination of the industrial waste cost recovery 
charge for that industrial user. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-384. - Measurement of industrial waste flow and strength. 
(a) ?The city shall reserve the right to sample and test all discharges at any time and bill the dischargers 
for all involved costs. The city shall establish discharge loads and industrial waste cost recovery 
charges based on either or both tests and this shall be binding as a basis for industrial waste cost 
recovery charges. 
(b) ?Industrial waste dischargers, within 90 days of the date of notification to be included in the 
surcharge program by the city, shall, subject to city control and direction, install and maintain at their 
expense acceptable water meters or flow metering devices and samplers and manholes as required 
to determine waste characteristics discharged to the public sewers. 
(1) ?Flow metering devices, installed in monitoring manholes on service lines, will be required for 
measurement of the volume of waste discharged to the sewers when volumes cannot otherwise

Individual wastewater discharge permits identify requirements for testing of these pollutants. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-413. - Other local limit requirements. 
(a) ?The city will normally apply the local limits found in sections 114-411 and 114-412 of this division at 
the end-of-pipe point where the non-residential wastewater is discharged to public sewer system. 
The city reserves the right to apply said local limits at an end-of process discharge location that 
connects to the public sewer system in the event that a unique sampling manhole at end-of-pipe is 
not available. 
(b) ?The city may also establish, by code or in a wastewater discharge permit or general permit, control 
over the quantities and rates of discharge. 
(c) ?The city may also establish, by code or in a wastewater discharge permit, mass limitations rather 
than concentration limitations on discharges, particularly in cases when users are using dilution to 
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of 
mass limitations is appropriate. 
(d) ?The city may also establish site-specific conventional and toxic limits for any applicable pollutant on 
a case-by-case basis. These limits shall be set forth in a wastewater discharge permit per section 
114-442 in this Code. 
(e) ?The city may also require development and implementation of best management practices (BMPs), 
by code or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement local limits 
and the requirements of section 114-322 in this Code and categorical limits in section 114-323 in this 
Code. 
(f) ?Any user, discharging pollutants to the city's facilities, where the city determines it is more effective 
that the city pretreat but causes the city to alter its method of wastewater treatment or sludge 
disposal to a more costly method, shall be assessed the differential cost between the more costly 
method of treatment and the less costly method of treatment. Such costs shall only be assessed 
upon approval of the city council. 
(g) ?The city reserves the right to set specific limits for those pollutants not identified in sections 114-411 
or 114-412 in this Code on a case by case basis for impacts caused to the treatment works including 
but not limited to interference, upset, pass through and prevention of beneficial sludge re-use. Those 
limits shall be set forth in a wastewater discharge permit per section 114-442 in this Code. 
(1) ?Local limits for additional pollutants not identified in sections 114-411 or 114-412 in this division 
will be noticed to the permit holder a minimum of 30 days prior to the effective date of the 
wastewater discharge permit. In the event that the city receives written comment on said limit 
during the comment period, the limit will take effect within 60 days of the public notice date to 
allow review and comment by the city. 
(2) ?The city may alter the implementation date of a new site specific limit to another date as a 
provision of an implementation schedule that is included as an attachment to the wastewater 
discharge permit as a result of pretreatment construction provided the waste does not exceed 
prohibitive discharge limitations in section 114-322 in this Code and the city can meet its 
limitations for water and bio-solids in the interim. 
(3) ?In the event that the city can mitigate the impact for an interim period by using additional 
treatment alternatives, the user will be required to pay those additional costs as a result of the 
mitigation.

Subdivision I. 


Sec. 114-430. - Wastewater discharge permit requirements and application. 


Sec. 114-431. - Wastewater information and analysis. 
    When requested by the pretreatment coordinator, a user must submit information on the nature and 
characteristics of its wastewater within 30 calendar days of the request. The pretreatment coordinator is 
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this 
information. The pretreatment coordinator may also prepare specialized forms for various business types 
and functions. Information that may be required will be consistent with that identified in section 114-310 in

Sec. 114-432. - Wastewater discharge permit authority and requirements. 
(a) ?Individual wastewater discharge permit issued to significant industrial users (SIUs) which includes 
categorical industrial users (CIUs). No SIU, including any CIU, shall discharge wastewater into the 
POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit from the pretreatment 
coordinator except that a SIU, including any CIU, that has filed a timely application pursuant to this 
division may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. The city may issue general 
wastewater discharge permits to SIU or CIU if the conditions in subsection (b) below are met. 
(b) ?General wastewater discharge permit issued to SIU and CIU. At the discretion of the pretreatment 
coordinator, the city may use general permits to control discharges to the POTW if the following 
conditions are met: 
(1) ?Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 
(2) ?Discharge the same types of waste; 
(3) ?Require the same effluent limitations or best management practices; 
(4) ?Require the same or similar monitoring and/or reporting requirements; and 
(5) ?In the opinion of the pretreatment coordinator, are more appropriately controlled under a 
general permit than under individual wastewater discharge permits. 
(c) ?Other wastewater discharge permits. The pretreatment coordinator may require other non-
residential users to obtain either individual or general wastewater discharge permits as necessary to 
carry out the purposes of this division. The wastewater discharge permit will define that holders of 
permits issued under this section shall not be classified as significant industrial users. Non-
residential users with wastewater discharge permits in this class may include but are not limited to: 
(1) ?Any user that has been determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user as defined 
in section 114-291 in this Code; 
(2) ?Any user that has been determined not to be a SIU as defined in section 114-291 in this Code 
that the pretreatment coordinator requires to be regulated by wastewater discharge permit; 
(3) ?Any user subject to national categorical pretreatment standards that opts not to discharge said 
regulated waste shall obtain a zero process wastewater discharge permit;

    In the event that either the city, EPA or a user determines that the user is regulated as a categorical 
industrial user by standards and requirements promulgated by the USEPA in accordance with section 
307(b) and (c) of the Act, the following reports are required to be filed by the user with both the city and 
USEPA. 
(1) ?Baseline monitoring reports. Within either 180 calendar days after the effective date of a 
categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category 
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users 
currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the pretreatment 
coordinator a report which contains the information listed below. At least 90 calendar days prior 
to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical 
industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall 
submit to the pretreatment coordinator a report which contains the information listed below. A 
new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable 
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and 
quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
Users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
a. ?Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the 
operator and owner. 
b. ?Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c. ?Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, 
(including each product produced by type, amount, processes, and rate of production), and 
standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This 
description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of 
discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d. ?Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily 
flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, 
as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 
403.6(e). 
e. ?Measurements of pollutants. 
1. ?The user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each 
regulated process; 
2. ?The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and 
concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the pretreatment 
coordinator, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. 
Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations, (or mass, 
where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily 
operations. In cases where the standard requires a best management practice or 
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by 
the pretreatment coordinator or the applicable standards to determine compliance with 
the standard; 
3. ?The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to complete the data 
necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. A minimum of four grab 
samples may be required to be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, 
sulfide, and volatile organic compounds; 
4. ?Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such 
exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. 
If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the 
user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow the use of the 
combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance 
with pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been 
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with 
supporting data shall be submitted to the city; 
5. ?Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 114-
327 in this Code and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in 
section 114-328 in this Code; 
6. ?The pretreatment coordinator may allow the submission of a baseline report which 
utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to 
determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; and 
7. ?The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods 
of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of 
normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the city. 
f. ?Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative of 
the CIU (as defined in section 114-291 in this Code), and certified by a qualified 
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent 
basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional 
pretreatment is required for the CIU to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g. ?Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the 
pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule is required by which the user will provide 
such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not 
be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A 
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in 
section 114-452(b) of this division. 
h. ?Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and 
certified in accordance with section 114-436 of this division. 
(2) ?Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance 
schedule required by above: 
a. ?The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the 
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation 
of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment 
standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing 
preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and 
completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
b. ?No increment referred to above shall exceed nine calendar months; 
c. ?The user shall submit a progress report to the pretreatment coordinator no later than 14 
calendar days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance 
including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the 
reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the 
established schedule; 
d. ?In no event shall more than nine calendar months elapse between such progress reports to 
the pretreatment coordinator; and 
e. ?All compliance schedule progress reports must be signed and certified in accordance with 
section 114-436 of this division. 
(3) ?Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 calendar 
days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, 
or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into 
the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to 
the pretreatment coordinator a report containing the information described in section 114-452(a) 
of this division. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in 
accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable 
measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical 
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of 
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production 
during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in 
accordance with section 114-436 of this division. All sampling will be done in conformance with 
section 114-327(d). 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-453. - Periodic compliance reports/self-monitoring reports. 
(a) ?Significant industrial users. 
(1) ?Significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the pretreatment coordinator, 
but in no case less than twice per year (on dates specified by the city), submit a report to the 
city with a description of the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are 
limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily 
flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in 
accordance with section 114-436 of this division. 
(2) ?These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the 
report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR part 136 and 
amendments thereto. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge 
and comply with the requirements of sections 114-327 and 114-328 of this Code. 
(3) ?If the city elects, all sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of significant 
industrial user. In such cases, the city will issue an attachment to the wastewater discharge 
permit that specifies the city will perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at minimum. All 
costs of sampling and analysis will be performed at the expense of the SIU. 
(4) ?In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management 
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required 
by the pretreatment coordinator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the 
compliance status of the user. 
(5) ?If the city elects, where the city itself collects all the information required for the report, the 
significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
(b) ?Categorical industrial users. 
(1) ?All categorical industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the pretreatment 
coordinator, but in no case less than twice per year, on dates specified by the city (normally in 
July and January), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the 
discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average 
and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. At the discretion of the city and in 
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the 
city may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. All 
periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 114-436 of 
this division. 
(2) ?These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the 
report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR part 136 and 
amendments thereto. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge 
and comply with the requirements of sections 114-327 and 114-328 of this Code. 
(3) ?If the city elects, this sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of the 
categorical industrial user. In such cases, the city will issue an attachment to the wastewater 
discharge permit that specifies the city will perform sampling and analysis semi-annually at 
minimum. All costs of sampling and analysis will be performed at the expense of the CIU. 
(4) ?If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more 
frequently than required by the pretreatment coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in 
sections 114-327 and 114-328, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(5) ?Where the city has imposed mass limitations on users as provided for by 40 CFR 403.6(c), the 
report required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated 
by the pretreatment standards in the discharge from the industrial user. 
(6) ?For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city in 
accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (b)(1) 
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users 
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant 
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by 
paragraph (b)(1) shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
(7) ?In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management 
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required 
by the pretreatment coordinator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the 
compliance status of the user. 
(8) ?Upon approval of a monitoring waiver for pollutants found to be not present and revision of the 
user's permit by the pretreatment coordinator, the user must certify on each periodic report with 
the statement in section 114-436 of this division, that there has been no increase in the pollutant 
in its wastestream due to activities of the user with the following statement: 
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance 
with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR _______ (specify applicable national categorical 
pretreatment standard part(s)), I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has 
been no increase in the level of the _______________ (list the categorically regulated 
pollutant(s)) in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic 
report." 
(9) ?In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because 
of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the 
monitoring requirements of section 114-453(b)(1) of this division or other more frequent 
monitoring requirements imposed by the pretreatment coordinator, and notify the pretreatment 
coordinator. 
(c) ?Non-significant categorical users. 
(1) ?Non-significant categorical industrial users as defined in section 114-291 in this Code shall, at 
a frequency determined by the pretreatment coordinator but no less frequently than annually (on 
dates specified by the city) submit a report which contains the certification statement contained 
in section 114-453(c)(2) of this division below. 
(2) ?Certification statement. 
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance 
with the categorical pretreatment standards under 40 CFR _______, I certify that, to the best of 
my knowledge and belief that during the period from __________, __________ to _________, 
__________ (months, days, year):

The report is required to be signed by an authorized representative of the user. 
(d) ?Other non-significant regulated users. 
(1) ?Categorical zero process dischargers, non-categorical zero process dischargers, batch 
dischargers, food service establishments and any firms regulated by individual or general permit 
requirements including but not limited to best management practices shall, at a frequency 
determined by the pretreatment coordinator, submit a periodic report at a frequency defined in 
their wastewater discharge permit. 
(2) ?The reports may require sampling and analyses or some other measure to determine 
compliance with permit pretreatment standards and requirements. This sampling and analyses 
may be performed by the city in lieu of the user. All costs of sampling and analyses will be 
performed at the expense of the user. The user must submit documentation necessary to 
determine the compliance status of user as defined by the pretreatment coordinator and 
identified in the wastewater discharge permit. 
(3) ?All FSE with GT and GI must maintain cleaning logs. These logs shall be immediately available 
at the time of an inspection and are required to contain the following information:

in section 114-291 in this Code shall file a change notice with the city within 30 calendar days. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-455. - Reports of changed conditions. 
    Each user must notify the pretreatment coordinator of any planned substantial changes to the user's 
operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 
calendar days before the change that results in an increase or addition or planned shutdown or deletion 
of products. Immediate shutdowns or deletions of products are required to be noticed within five work 
days of determination. 
(1) ?The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to submit such information as may be 
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater 
discharge permit application under section 114-435 of this division. 
(2) ?The pretreatment coordinator may issue or modify an existing individual or general wastewater 
discharge permit under sections 114-442 and 114-444 of this division in response to changed 
conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3) ?For purposes of this requirement, substantial changes include, but are not limited to, flow 
increases of 20 percent or greater, the addition or deletion of a shift, the discharge of any 
previously unreported pollutants including changes to the listed or characteristic hazardous 
wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under section 114-458 of this division, 
introduction of a pollutant for which a monitoring waiver had been obtained, the addition of a 
new process regardless of waste discharge or lack of discharge, shutdown of a process, or 
addition or deletion of a product. 
(4) ?Significant industrial users and categorical industrial users are required to immediately notify 
the pretreatment coordinator of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug 
discharge. 
(5) ?When shutdowns are scheduled, a closure plan is required to be submitted to the pretreatment 
coordinator along with the notification. When shutdowns are not scheduled, a closure plan will 
be required to be submitted prior to the start of the cleanup and closure of the facility. 
Documentation of the disposal of concentrated wastes in accordance with EPA requirements 
will be required. In the case of an FSE, the GT and/or GI are required to be cleaned prior to 
vacating the property. An inspection of a shutdown site shall be required to confirm all 
chemicals and wastes have been removed from the site. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-456. - Reports of potential problems. 
(a) ?Initial accidental discharge notification. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, 
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch 
discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, any user shall 
immediately telephone, and notify the pretreatment coordinator of the incident. If this notification 
cannot be made to the POTW staff during routine business hours, the user shall consult the city's 
website for the after-hours phone number. This notification shall include the name of the caller, 
location of the discharge, physical state of discharge, chemical composition, concentration and 
volume, if known, and date and time of discharge as well as duration of the discharge, and corrective

fails. 
(c) ?Written accidental discharge notification. Within five work days following such discharge, the user 
shall, unless waived by the pretreatment coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing the 
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future 
occurrences. 
(d) ?Such notifications shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which 
may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW works, natural resources, or any other damage 
to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other 
liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(e) ?A notice/sign shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place 
advising employees in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event of a 
discharge described in paragraph (a) above. Employers shall ensure through documentation that all 
employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification 
procedure. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-457. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
    If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the pretreatment 
coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling 
and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator within 30 
calendar days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the 
pretreatment coordinator monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the pretreatment 
coordinator samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this 
sampling. If the city performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the user, the city will perform the 
repeat sampling and analysis at the user's expense unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires 
the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-458. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a) ?Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12(P) any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall 
notify the POTW, the USEPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous 
waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise 
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the 
name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, 
and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the 
following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an 
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and 
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and 
an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the 
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 calendar days after the 
discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each 
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under 
section 114-455 of this division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to 
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-
monitoring requirements of sections 114-452(a), 114-452(c), and 114-453(b) of this division. 
(b) ?Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in 
which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute 
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). discharge of more than 15 
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous 
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent 
months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not 
require additional notification. 
(c) ?In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics 
of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify 
the pretreatment coordinator, the USEPA regional waste management waste division director, and 
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 calendar days of the 
effective date of such regulations. 
(d) ?In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in 
place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has 
determined to be economically practical. 
(e) ?This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be 
discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Sec. 114-470. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 


Sec. 114-471. - Upset. 
(a) ?For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is 
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of 
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the 
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment 
facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b) ?An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with 
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c) ?A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly 
signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1) ?An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2) ?The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in 
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3) ?The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment coordinator within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written report must 
be provided within five work days): 
a. ?A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b. ?The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the 
anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c. ?Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the 
noncompliance. 
(d) ?In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have 
the burden of proof. 
(e) ?Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an 
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f) ?Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with 
categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the 
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the 
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, 
lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-472. - Bypass. 
(a) ?For the purposes of this section: 
(1) ?Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment 
facility. 
(2) ?Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the 
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss 
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. 
Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b) ?A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or 
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient 
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c) ?Bypass notifications. 
(1) ?Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to 
the pretreatment coordinator, at least ten work days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2) ?Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an 
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the 
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five 
work days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall 
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact 
dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to 
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the 
bypass. The pretreatment coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if 
the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d) ?POTW actions. 
(1) ?Bypass is prohibited, and the pretreatment coordinator may take an enforcement action against 
a user for a bypass, unless: 
a. ?Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b. ?There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment 
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of 
equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should 
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a 
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive 
maintenance; and 
c. ?The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2) ?The pretreatment coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse 
effects, if the pretreatment coordinator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

    The pretreatment coordinator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that 
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by the POTW, a list of the users which, 
during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards 
and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users 
and categorical industrial users (or any other user that violates paragraphs (c), (d) or (h) of this section 
and shall mean: 
(1) ?Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or 
more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period 
exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including 
instantaneous limits as defined in section 114-291(b) in this Code; 
(2) ?Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of 
wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals 
or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including 
instantaneous limits, as defined by section 114-291(b) in this Code multiplied by the applicable 
criteria (1.4 for BOD, COD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except 
pH); 
(3) ?Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by division 4 of article 
V (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the 
pretreatment coordinator has determined caused, alone or in combination with other 
discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel 
or the general public; 
(4) ?Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the 
environment, or has resulted in the pretreatment coordinator's exercise of his or her emergency 
authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5) ?Failure to meet, within 90 calendar days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule 
milestone contained in an individual or general wastewater discharge permit or enforcement 
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;

Subdivision IV. 


Sec. 114-510. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 


Sec. 114-511. - Notification of violation and administrative fines. 
(a) ?When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any 
provision of article V, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other 
pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may serve upon that user a 
written notice of violation (NOV). An explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory 
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user 
to the pretreatment coordinator within 20 city business days of issuance excluding holidays. 
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or 
after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b) ?The pretreatment coordinator may initiate a pretreatment review issued under section 114-451(a) in 
this Code for any violation but most likely for the first violation of any parameter. Upon the issuance 
of the pretreatment review, the city shall schedule a pretreatment review meeting, normally within 30 
calendar days of the determination that a meeting is required. 
    As a result of a pretreatment review meeting, the city may issue a compliance directive stating that 
the user is in a "corrective action" status. A plan for correction and compliance schedule illustrating 
milestones may be issued by the city to the user. This plan for correction and compliance schedule may 
become part of the user's permit. The user is responsible for meeting the permit limits at all times. The 
plan for correction, compliance schedule and revised permit do not relieve the user of meeting the permit 
limits and/or article requirements. The user shall take whatever actions are necessary to meet the permit 
limits and permit conditions. 
(c) ?As a result of a violation, the city may continue or increase sampling, analyses and inspection of the 
user's progress towards meeting milestones as needed to determine if the user is complying with the 
conditions of the plan of action, compliance schedule and/or permit. In the event that the city detects 
and documents any violation, a NOV will be issued to the user. The costs of the additional sampling, 
analyses, and inspections shall be invoiced to the user. 
(d) ?Each detected violation of the plan of action, compliance schedule, and permit, will result in an NOV 
being issued to the user. Any violation may result in the user being issued a "non-traffic complaint 
citation." 
(e) ?When the user has met the conditions of the plan of action, compliance schedule, and permit, the 
city will notify the user in writing that the conditions have been satisfied and that the user is no longer 
under a "corrective action" status if such a status was formally issued. 
(f) ?When the user has not received an NOV for 365 calendar days for a specific parameter or reporting 
violation, the count will be reset to zero. 
(g) ?Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the pretreatment coordinator to take any action, 
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of 
violation. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-512. - Compliance agreements. 
    The pretreatment coordinator may enter into compliance agreements, i.e. consent orders, 
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user 
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to 
correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have 
the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 114-514 and 114-515 
of this division and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-513. - Show cause order. 
    The pretreatment coordinator may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any 
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other 
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the representatives of the city and show cause 
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying 
the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a 
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice 
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at 
least ten city business days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized 
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any 
other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-514. - Compliance orders. 
    When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any 
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other 
pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may issue an order to the user 
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the 
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless 
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. 
Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including 
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants 
discharged to the public sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance 
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of 
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a 
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-515. - Cease and desist orders. 
    When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any 
provision of article V, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment 
standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the pretreatment coordinator 
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1) ?Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2) ?Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a 
continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any 
other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-516. - Emergency suspensions. 
    The pretreatment coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to 
the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which 
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare 
of persons. The pretreatment coordinator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after 
informal notice, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may 
present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1) ?Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its 
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the 
suspension order, the pretreatment coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, 
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the 
POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals or the environment. The 
pretreatment coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator that the period of 
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 114-517 of this 
division are initiated against the user. 
(2) ?A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent 
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful 
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment 
coordinator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 114-513 
and 114-517 of this division. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension 
under this section. 
(Ord. No. 308H, § 1, 9-6-16) 


Sec. 114-517. - Termination of discharge. 
    In addition to the provisions in section 114-516 of this division, any user who violates the following 
conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1) ?Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2) ?Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3) ?Failure to report substantial changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and 
characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4) ?Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, 
or sampling; or 
(5) ?Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 320 in this Code. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity 
to show cause under section 114-513 of this division why the proposed action should not be taken. 
Exercise of this option by the pretreatment coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking 
any other action against the user.

violation or discharge. The city may invoice the costs, including but not limited to, sampling and analyses 
associated with the investigation, costs of mitigating impact to the wastewater treatment works, costs of 
preparing the administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders; investigative and/or 
correction actions, and review of response(s) from the user. In the event of damage, losses or 
impairments, the city shall bill the user for the costs incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair, 
replacement or other investigative and/or corrective action(s) as a response to the violation or discharge. 
Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this division enforceable under the 
provisions of section 114-510 of this division.

    When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any 
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other 
pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may petition a court of competent 
jurisdiction through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as 
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, 
order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The pretreatment 
coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a 
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be 
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

individual or general wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other 
pretreatment standard or requirement may be subject to the imposition of a civil penalty in at least 
the amount of $1,000.00 a day for each violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term 
average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each calendar day during the period of the 
violation. 
(b) ?The pretreatment coordinator may recover costs, including but not limited to, filing fees, witness 
fees, consultant fees, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement 
activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred 
by the city. 
(c) ?In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant 
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the 
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, 
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice 
requires.

reasonably access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized 
or required by this article. 
(7) ?If the city, or other authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the 
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable 
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect 
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify 
compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public 
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may

prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the 
use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or 
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said 
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of 
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a 
valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the 
extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be 
part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of 
the NPDES permit.

including but not limited to, court costs and attorney's fees, unless the court finds in favor of the 
violator. 
(c) ?In the event of an illegal discharge that constitutes an immediate threat to persons, property or the 
environment, the authorized enforcement agency is authorized to summarily abate the nuisance and 
the cost of such abatement, together with ancillary administrative costs, shall be borne by the violator 
and/or owner of the property on which the violation occurred, and the cost of such abatement shall 
be a lien upon said property.

employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red

Ord. No. 801G, § 4, provided that the zoning code adopted by § 3 would become effective on the 
effective date of the ordinance adopting the new zoning map for the city. The new zoning map was 
adopted on April 3, 2006. 


ARTICLE 0. - INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS 


Sec. 150.001. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the "City of Belvidere Zoning Ordinance," 
except as referred to herein, where it shall be known as "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.002. - Authority. 
    This Chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by the State of Illinois Statutes. Specific 
statutory references are provided within the body of this chapter solely as a means of assisting the 
reader. Such references are not to be considered as all inclusive and shall in no manner be construed so 
as to limit the application or interpretation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.003. - Legislative intent and purpose. 
    In enacting this chapter, special attention has been given to ensuring a direct relationship of these 
regulations to the city's comprehensive plan. The general intent of this chapter is to implement certain 
goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan which are best addressed through zoning approaches, as 
enabled by state statutes. 
(1) ?This Chapter is designed to control and lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from 
fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to promote adequate 
light and air; to encourage the protection of groundwater resources; to prevent the overcrowding 
of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to preserve, protect and promote property 
values; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, 
and other public facilities; and to preserve burial sites. 
(2) ?Specifically, this chapter is adopted for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, 
morals, comfort, convenience and general welfare by implementing certain goals and objectives 
of the comprehensive plan. Additional purposes of this chapter are specified throughout this 
chapter. 
Rationale: In developing the specific regulations of this chapter, much effort has gone into 
balancing the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. The current status of this chapter 
and its components (including the official zoning map) represents the cohesive result of 
carefully considered plan implementation practices. Amendments to these provisions and/or the 
official zoning map shall seriously consider the effect of such changes on the interrelationships 
which exist within this chapter, and between this document, the comprehensive plan, and 
related long-range planning policies and programs (see §§ 150.902 and 150.903). 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.004. - Rationale and the appearance of ordinance text. 
(a) ?Rationale. Throughout this chapter, paragraphs labeled "Rationale" are included to ensure a 
complete understanding of the purpose and reasoning of the city in adopting that particular portion of 
this chapter. Each rationale is intended as an official statement of the legislative findings or 
purposes, and shall be treated in the same manner as other aspects of legislative history, and shall 
serve to guide the administrative and judicial interpretation of this chapter. The specific rationale 
expressed in each rationale section are not intended to be exhaustive, and other non-explicit 
rationale may also be applicable. 
(b) ?Appearance of ordinance text. The underlined, boldfaced, italicized, alternative point-sized, and/or 
capitalized typefaces used in this chapter are inserted only for convenience, and are in no way to be 
construed as part of the provisions of this chapter or as a limitation on the scope of the particular 
sections or subsections to which they refer. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.005. - Separability and nonliability. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the several provisions of this chapter 
are severable in accordance with the following: 
(1) ?If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this chapter to be invalid, 
such judgment shall not affect any other provisions of this chapter not specifically included in 
said judgment. 
(2) ?If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any portion of this 
chapter to a particular property, water, building, or structure, such judgment shall not affect the 
application of said provision to any other property, water, building, or structure not specifically 
included in said judgment. 
(3) ?If any requirement or limitation attached to an authorization given under this chapter is found 
invalid, it shall be presumed that the authorization would not have been granted without the 
requirement or limitation and, therefore, said authorization shall also be invalid. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.006. - Rules of interpretation. 
(a) ?In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum 
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and shall be liberally 
construed in favor of the city and shall not be construed to be a limitation or repeal of any other 
power now possessed by the city. 
(b) ?Where property is affected by the regulations imposed by any provision of this chapter and by other 
governmental regulations, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher 
standards or requirements shall prevail. Regardless of any other provision of this chapter, no land 
shall be developed or used, and no structure erected or maintained in violation of any state or federal 
regulations. 
(c) ?No structure, land, water or air shall hereafter be used and no structure or part thereof shall 
hereafter be located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, converted or structurally 
altered without full compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable local, 
county and state regulations. 
(d) ?Nothing herein contained shall require any changes in plans, construction, size or designated use of 
any building or part thereof, for which a zoning or building permit has been issued before the 
effective date of this chapter and the construction of which shall have been started within six months 
from the date of such permit. However, any such building or part thereof that is inconsistent with this 
chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming use and be subject to the provisions of § 150.801. 
(e) ?Except as provided in this chapter, under provisions for nonconforming uses (§ 150.801), 
nonconforming developments (§ 150.802), substandard lots (§ 150.803), and nonconforming 
structures and buildings (§ 150.804), no building, structure, development or premises shall be 
hereinafter used or occupied and no applicable permit granted, that does not conform to the 
requirements of this chapter. 
(f) ?In cases of mixed-occupancy or mixed-use buildings or parts thereof, the regulations for each land 
use shall apply to that portion of the structure or land so occupied or so used. 
(g) ?Except for outlots authorized under the city's subdivision regulations to contain permanently 
protected green space area, no yard or other open space shall be considered as providing a yard or 
open space for a building or structure on any other lot. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.007. - Jurisdiction. 
    This chapter is applicable to all territory located within the corporate limits of the city and any 
additional extraterritorial territory as authorized by state statute. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.008. - Re-enactment and repeal. 
(a) ?This chapter, in part, carries forward by re-enactment some of the provisions of the regulations 
governing zoning and related matters, being previously known collectively as the "zoning code," 
chapter 150 of the Belvidere Municipal Code, adopted prior to the effective date of this chapter. It is 
not the intention of this chapter to repeal, but rather to re-enact and continue in force such existing 
provisions so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are preserved and may be 
enforced, unless explicitly surrendered by specific provisions of this chapter or altered by the official 
zoning map. 
(b) ?All provisions of chapter 150 of the Belvidere Municipal Code which are not re-enacted herein are 
hereby repealed. 
(c) ?The adoption of this chapter shall not adversely affect the city's right to prosecute any violation of 
the predecessor zoning ordinance provided the violation occurred while that chapter was in effect. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.009. - Effective date. 
    All plans approved under previous zoning regulations shall be valid and may be used to obtain 
permits for a period of not more than one year after the effective date of this chapter, except where 
subject to developer's agreement provisions. However, any such building or part thereof resulting from 
these plans that is inconsistent with this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming use and be subject to 
the provisions of § 150.801. This chapter shall become effective upon passage and posting according to 
law, following the date of repeal and re-enactment of the official zoning map. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06)

Sec. 150.011. - Word usage.

lines shall be construed as following the centerline of such streets or railroad lines. 
(C) ?Zoning district boundary lines shown as following or approximately following platted lot lines or 
other property lines as shown on the city or county tax maps shall be construed as following 
such lines. 
(D) ?Zoning district boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerlines of 
streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing watercourses shall be construed as following the 
channel centerlines of such watercourses, and, in the event of a natural change in the location 
of such streams, rivers, or other watercourses, the zoning district boundary shall be construed 
as moving with the channel centerline. 
(E) ?Zoning district boundaries shown as following or approximately following ridgelines or 
watershed boundaries shall be construed as following such lines. 
(F) ?Zoning district boundaries shown as separated from, any of the features listed in paragraphs

shown on the official zoning map, the location of the line shall be determined by the zoning 
administrator. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.105. - Purpose and intent of standard zoning districts. 
    The following subsections specify the purpose and intent of the standard zoning districts established 
by this chapter. 
(A) ?Agricultural district. 
(1) ?Rural holding (RH) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit development that is solely of a 
rural community character. The land use standards for this district permit very low-density 
single-family residential development at a density of one dwelling unit for every 40 gross 
acres, as well as a variety of agricultural and agricultural support land uses. Density and 
intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that development that requires 
even a minimum of urban services does not occur until such services are available. As 
such, the rural holding (RH) district shall either serve as a designation which preserves and 
protects agricultural activities, or as a "holding zone" which provides for an interim land use 
(agriculture) that will easily permit further development (with rezoning to another district) at 
the appropriate time. 
Rationale: This district is used to provide for the protection of agricultural activities, and a 
very low density residential area for those who want to live in a rural environment and who 
retain enough land with their residence to ensure that the rural environment is maintained 
as long as the rural holding (RH) district designation is retained. In this manner, even if all 
property were developed in a given area with the rural holding (RH) district designation, the 
rural community character of that area would still be maintained.

(C) ?Nonresidential districts. 
(1) ?Neighborhood office (NO) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit high-quality office land uses at 
an intensity compatible with the older portions of the city predominately developed with 
large homes which are desirable to maintain, where traffic volumes and adjacent land uses 
dictate the transition of these areas to certain nonresidential uses. The desired 
neighborhood character of the development is attained through landscape surface area 
ratio (LSR) requirements, and by restricting the maximum building size (MBS) of all 
buildings within each instance of this district to 5,000 square feet. A range of dwelling unit 
types may be allowed. Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to 
ensure that this effect is achieved. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to adjacent 
residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a 
local residential street or a residential collector street. 
Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of an area, which 
preserves the original residential appearance, yet permits office land uses, and which 
ensures that the neighborhood character is maintained as long as the NO district 
designation is retained, regardless of how much development occurs within that area.

an intensity compatible with the overall community character of the city. A relatively low 
maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and significant areas of landscaping are required in this 
district to ensure that this effect is achieved. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to 
residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a 
local residential street or a residential collector street. 
Rationale: This district is used to provide for the permanent protection of an area for those 
who desire a high quality office environment which maintains the attractiveness of the site 
and retains enough open land in their development to ensure that the community character 
is maintained as long as the PO district designation is retained, regardless of how much 
development occurs within that area.

(3) ?Neighborhood business (NB) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit small-scale commercial 
development, which is compatible with the desired overall neighborhood community 
character of the area in general and with adjacent residential development in particular. 
The desired neighborhood community character of the development is attained through 
landscape surface area ratio (LSR) requirements, and by restricting the maximum building 
size (MBS) of all buildings within each instance of this district to 5,000 square feet. 
Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure that this effect is 
achieved. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no 
development within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a 
residential collector street. 
Rationale: This district is used to provide both convenience oriented goods and services 
and for the permanent protection of adjacent residential areas by permitting only a limited 
range of commercial activities. Together, these requirements ensure that the desired 
character is maintained as long as the NB district designation is retained, regardless of 
how much development occurs within that area.

(4) ?Planned business (PB) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit large and small-scale 
commercial development that is compatible with the desired overall community character 
of the area in general. Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure 
that this effect is achieved. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are 
permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential 
development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local 
residential street or a residential collector street. 
Rationale: This district is intended to provide the principal zoning district for commercial 
development that occurs after the adoption of this chapter. The standards of this district are 
designed to provide a clear distinction from the general business and central business 
districts in terms of permitted intensity of development, treatment of outdoor sales, and 
required green space areas. The desired suburban community character of the 
development is attained through the landscape surface area ratio (LSR) requirements. 
Together, these requirements ensure that the desired community character is maintained 
as long as the planned business district designation is retained, regardless of how much 
development occurs within that area.

(5) ?General business (GB) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit both large and small-scale 
commercial development at intensities that provide significant incentives for infill 
development and the continued economic viability of existing development. To accomplish 
this effect, minimum required green space ratios (GSRs) are substantially lower than those 
required in the planned business district. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land 
uses are permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to 
residential development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a 
local residential street or a residential collector street. 
Rationale: This district is intended to provide an alternative designation for commercial 
activity to the planned business district. Performance standards for the general business 
district are designed to ensure the long-term economic health of strip commercial 
development areas, existing as of the effective date of this chapter, by limiting the 
attraction of the planned business district to those uses which can afford the relatively 
higher development costs and rents associated with development in that district.

(6) ?Central business (CB) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit both large and small-scale 
"downtown" commercial development at an intensity that provides significant incentives for 
infill development, redevelopment, and the continued economic viability of existing 
development. To accomplish this effect, minimum landscape surface ratios (LSRs) 
permitted in this district are much lower than those allowed in the planned business and 
general business districts. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are 
permitted within this district. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential 
development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a local 
residential street or a residential collector street. No requirements for onsite landscaping or 
parking are required in this district. This district is strictly limited to the central city locations. 
Rationale: This district is intended to provide an alternative, primarily infill development, 
designation for commercial activity to the planned business (PB) and general business (GB) 
districts are designed to assist in maintaining the long-term viability of the central city.

(7) ?Planned industrial (PI) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit both large and small scale 
industrial and office development at an intensity that is consistent with the overall desired 
suburban community character of the community. Beyond a relatively high minimum green 
space ratio (GSR), the primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to 
indoor industrial activities not typically associated with high levels of noise, soot, odors and 
other potential nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of 
disruption to residential development, no development within this district shall take direct 
access to a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for suburban intensity light 
industrial land uses such as assembly operations, storage and warehousing facilities, 
offices, and light manufacturing which are protected from potential nuisances associated 
with certain development permitted within the general industrial (GI) district. In addition, 
land uses shall comply with the minimum performance standards presented in article 7.

(9) ?Heavy industrial (HI) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to permit both large and small scale 
industrial and office development at an intensity that provides ample incentive for infill 
development and redevelopment of industrial areas existing as of the effective date of this 
Chapter. This district is designed to permit a very wide variety of industrial uses which may 
occur both indoors and outdoors, including certain land uses which are permitted in no 
other zoning district because of their potential to create nuisances for adjoining properties. 
In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to residential development, no development 
within this district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a residential 
collector street. 
Rationale: This district is intended to provide a location for both light and heavy industrial 
uses in a zoning district in which the potential for nuisance complaints from nearby 
properties is minimized. It must be emphasized that this is not a district where virtually any 
land use is permitted, as all uses shall comply with the minimum performance standards 
presented in article 7. In addition, certain land uses such as extraction, junkyards and 
salvage operations, and freight terminals are permitted within this district only upon the 
granting of a special use permit.

standards for this district are designed to ensure that the Institutional District shall serve as 
a designation that reflects and protects the community character of its surrounding area. 
Rationale: This district is used to provide an appropriate mechanism for regulating 
institutional land uses to ensure that the development reflects and protects the community 
character of its surrounding area. This district is intended to be mapped either to provide 
clusters of institutional use (such as a campus) or to provide individual sites for institutional 
use (such as a neighborhood school or religious institution) within areas predominated by 
other zoning districts.

(E) ?Tollway corridor districts. 
(1) ?Planned mixed use 1 (PM-1) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to be similar to a Transit Oriented District 
(TOD). While TOD developments are mixed use, higher density communities that 
encourage people to live near transit services and decrease their dependence on driving, 
this district will be located near a tollway interchange and is anticipated to be near transit 
services in the future. TOD developments typically include a mix of land uses including 
moderate to high density residential, commercial and retail, both of which have easy, 
nearby access and walking routes to transit stations. To accomplish this effect, minimum 
landscape surface ratios (LSRs) and parking ratios permitted in this district are lower than 
those allowed in other business districts. A wide range of institutional, commercial, office, 
residential and transit uses are permitted within this district. Densities are greater nearer to 
the transit center. 
Rationale: This district is generally located along the 1-90 Corridor providing necessary 
services to both the southern portion of Boone County and the surrounding municipalities. 
This district is intended to provide a carefully controlled mix of institutional, commercial, 
office, residential, and transit uses based on high quality detailed plans. Buildings will be 
developed at one to three stories.

(3) ?Planned mixed use 4 (PM-4) district. 
A. ?Description and purpose. This district is intended to be similar to a transit oriented district 
(TOD). While TOD developments are mixed use, higher density communities that 
encourage people to live near transit services and decrease their dependence on driving, 
this district will be located near a tollway interchange and is anticipated to be near transit 
services in the future. TOD developments typically include a mix of land uses including 
moderate to high density residential, commercial and retail, both of which have easy, 
nearby access and walking routes to transit stations. To accomplish this effect, minimum 
landscape surface ratios (LSRs) and parking ratios permitted in this district are lower than 
those allowed in other business districts. A wide range of institutional, commercial, office, 
residential and transit uses are permitted within this district. Densities are greater nearer to 
the transit center. 
Rationale: This district is primarily located south of US Highway 20 and south of Interstate 
90, with close proximity to both the Irene interchange and any future transit stop. 
Development in this district is at a higher density allowing commuters to access businesses 
easier while the compact design helps prevent sprawl. This district is intended to provide 
an intensive but carefully controlled mix of institutional, commercial, office, residential, and 
transit uses based on high quality detailed plans. Buildings will be developed at four to ten 
stories.

undeveloped areas of the community, which require flexible zoning treatment because of 
factors that are specific to the site. This district is designed to forward both aesthetic and 
economic objectives of the City by controlling the site design and the land use, 
appearance, density, or intensity of development within the district in a manner consistent 
with sound land use, urban design, and economic revitalization principles. The application 
of these standards will ensure long-term progress and broad participation toward these 
principles. Refer to § 150.907 for the procedures applicable to proposal review in this 
standard zoning district. 
B. ?Development standards. Development standards are flexible within this zoning district.

Sec. 150.106. - Overlay districts. 
(A) ?Purpose. Overlay districts are created for the purpose of imposing special regulations in given 
designated areas of the city to accomplish stated purposes that are set forth for each overlay district. 
Overlay districts shall be in addition to, and shall overlap and overlay all other zoning districts within 
which lands placed in each district also lie, so that any parcel of land lying in an overlay district shall 
also lie in one or more of the other zoning districts provided for in this chapter. 
(B) ?Establishment. Overlay zoning districts and amendments thereto shall be established in the same 
fashion and by the same procedures set forth in § 150.902 and § 150.903 for other zoning districts 
provided for by this chapter unless these procedures are qualified by the provisions of a particular 
overlay district as set forth herein. 
(C) ?Downtown overlay district. This district is intended to implement the urban design recommendations 
of the comprehensive plan, by preserving and enhancing the historical quality of the downtown, and 
by attaining a consistent visually pleasing image for the downtown area. All buildings located on 
either side of the street along North State Street between West Madison Avenue and the 
Kishwaukee River; South State Street between the Kishwaukee River and West Second Street; and 
Logan Avenue between South State Street and South Main Street are included in the downtown 
overlay district, excluding the property located at the southeast corner of South State Street and 
Logan Avenue commonly known as 600 South State Street (Lots 1 through 5, Block 2 and Lots 1, 2 
and 10 and the east 33 feet of Lot 6, Block 6, Cohoon and Allens Addition); and excluding the 
property commonly known as 620-624 South State Street (the west 132 feet of Lot Six, Block Six of 
Cohoon and Allen Addition). These streets comprise the core downtown area. 
    As emphasized by the comprehensive plan, this district is designed to forward both aesthetic and 
economic objectives of the city by controlling the site design and appearance of development within the 
district in a manner that is consistent with sound land use, urban design, and economic revitalization 
principles. The application of these standards will ensure long-term progress and broad participation 
toward these principles. Refer to § 150.908 for the procedures applicable to proposal review in this 
overlay district.

K. ?Transom: A horizontal bar of stone, wood or glass across the opening of a door or window. 
(2) ?Urban design standards for the downtown design overlay zoning district overall design theme. 
The design theme for the downtown area is based on the historic character of the city's 
settlement period characterized in the buildings and storefronts along the core downtown 
streets. 
A. ?Nonresidential development. The design theme varies by location. 
 
Nonresidential Development 
1. ?Street frontage. Along the core downtown streets, the nonresidential design theme is 
characterized by a variety of architectural styles popular at the time, including 
Italianate, Romanesque and Neoclassical, in a two-story format with office, storage or 
residential located over commercial. The facades of these buildings have a traditional 
main street storefront appearance, are relatively small in scale, have street-yard and 
side-yard setbacks of zero feet, have prominent horizontal and vertical patterns 
formed by regularly-spaced window and door openings, detailed cornice designs, rich 
detailing in masonry coursing, window detailing and ornamentation, and are 
predominantly of brick, stone or wood. Exterior building materials are of high-quality. 
Exterior appurtenances are minimal. Exterior colors are harmonious, simple and 
muted. Exterior signage blends, rather than contrasts with buildings in terms of 
coloring (complementary to building), location (on-building), size (small) and number 
(few). 
2. ?Remainder of downtown design overlay zoning district. In this area, the nonresidential 
design theme is characterized by a variety of architectural styles popular throughout 
the entire 20th century. Building styles, heights, setbacks and details vary 
significantly. In the desired theme, exterior building materials are of high-quality. 
Exterior appurtenances are minimal. Exterior colors are harmonious, simple and 
muted. Exterior signage blends, rather than contrasts with buildings in terms of 
coloring (complementary to building), location (on-building), size (small) and number 
(few). 
3. ?Residential development. This theme is characterized by a variety of architectural 
styles popular at the time, including Queen Anne, Gothic, High Victorian, Georgian, 
and Prairie. These homes have generous street-yard, side-yard and rear-yard 
setbacks, and are well-landscaped with a mixture of canopy and understory yard 
trees, and foundation shrubs and/or flower beds. For illustrative purposes, examples 
of architectural styles which tend to have elements incompatible with downtown 
historic styles include (with no attempt to be inclusive) Spanish Mission, Scandinavian 
Modern, Bavarian, and California Contemporary. 
B. ?Nonresidential construction. 
 
Nonresidential Construction 
1. ?General. Nonresidential construction, including new structures, building additions, 
building alterations, and restoration or rehabilitation shall correspond to the urban 
design guideline requirements for building setback; height; building mass; horizontal 
rhythms (created by the placement and design of facade openings and related 
elements such as piers, columns); vertical rhythms (created by the placement and 
design of facade details such as sills, transoms, cornices and sign bands); roof forms; 
exterior materials; exterior surface features and appurtenances; exterior colors; 
exterior signage; on-site landscaping; exterior lighting; parking and loading area 
design; and the use of screening. 
2. ?Determination. Design guideline requirements shall be determined by either the 
zoning administrator or the planning and zoning commission, as specified in §§ 
150.908(D). 
3. ?Building setback. Throughout the district, the setback of buildings from street-yard and 
side-yard property lines shall be compatible with existing buildings in the immediate 
area which conform to the general design theme noted above. 
4. ?Building height. Throughout the district, the height of buildings shall be compatible 
with existing buildings in the immediate area which conform to the general design 
theme noted in §§ 150.106(D)(2)A., above. In no instance shall buildings be more 
than one story taller or shorter than the height of a building of similar use on one of 
the immediately adjoining properties, which conform to the general design theme 
above. 
5. ?Building mass. Throughout the district, the mass of buildings shall be compatible with 
existing buildings in the immediate area which conform to the general design theme 
noted above. The characteristic proportion (relationship between facade height and 
width) of the general design theme shall be maintained. Building mass for large 
structures (with a facade area exceeding 5,000 square feet) shall be disguised 
through the use of facade articulations, or through the use of exterior treatments 
which give the impression of directly adjoining individual buildings. 
6. ?Horizontal rhythms. Along the core downtown streets, the horizontal pattern of exterior 
building elements formed by patterns of building openings for windows and doors, and 
related elements such as piers and columns shall be spaced at regular intervals 
across all visible facades of the building, and shall be compatible with those of 
existing buildings in the immediate area which conform to the general design theme 
noted above. 
7. ?Vertical rhythms. Along the core downtown streets, the floor heights on main facades 
shall appear visually in proportion to those of adjoining buildings. The rhythm of the 
ground floor shall harmonize with the rhythm of upper floors. The vertical pattern of 
exterior building elements formed by patterns of building openings for windows and 
doors, and related elements such as sills, headers, transoms, cornices and sign 
bands shall be compatible in design and elevation with those of existing buildings in 
the immediate area which conform to the general design theme noted above. 
8. ?Roof forms. Along the core downtown streets, flat or gently sloping roofs which are not 
visible from the street shall be used. Mansards or other exotic roof shapes not 
characteristic of the general design theme noted above, shall not be used. Throughout 
the district, roof shapes not characteristic of the general design theme noted above, 
shall not be used. 
 
Roof Forms 
9. ?Exterior building materials. Selected building materials shall be compatible with those 
of existing buildings in the immediate area which conform to the general design theme 
noted above. In addition: 
A. ?Masonry. Along the core downtown streets, stone or brick facing should be of 
even coloration and consistent size. Cinder block, concrete block, concrete slab, 
or concrete panel shall not be permitted. 
B. ?Siding. Along the core downtown streets, wood or thin board textured vinyl or 
textured metal clapboard siding may be appropriate — particularly if the 
proposed non-masonry exterior was used on a building which conforms to the 
general design theme noted above. In certain instances clapboard, board and 
batten may be in keeping with the general design theme. Asphalt shingles shall 
not be permitted. 
C. ?Glazing. Along the core downtown streets, clear, or slightly tinted glass or related 
glazing material shall be used. Mirrored glass, smoked glass, or heavily tinted 
glass shall not be permitted. 
10. ?Exterior building colors. Selected exterior colors for structures and appurtenances 
including fixtures shall be compatible and harmonious with those of existing buildings 
in the immediate area which conform to the general design theme noted above. 
Specifically, throughout the district: 
A. ?Fluorescent, "day glow", and/or "neon" colors shall not be permitted. Earth tone 
colors are encouraged. 
B. ?High gloss paints, lacquers, varnishes or other "shiny" non-glazing surfaces shall 
not be used on the exterior of buildings. 
C. ?Color combination schemes shall not detract from the architectural features of a 
building and shall complement the existing natural materials on the building. 
D. ?Color schemes shall be used consistently throughout the property, including on 
both the upper and lower portions of buildings, and on all facades of a building or 
structure. 
11. ?Exterior surface appurtenances. Exterior surface appurtenances shall be compatible 
with those of existing buildings in the immediate area which conform to the general 
design theme noted above. In addition: 
A. ?Along the core downtown streets, the traditional storefront design theme 
(characterized by strong horizontal and vertical rhythms formed by building 
openings, storefront columns, storefront cornices, upper cornices, kickplates, 
signbands, large display windows, and transom windows) shall be employed for 
all new nonresidential buildings — including retail, office, professional service, 
personal service, maintenance, lodging, entertainment, and storage uses. 
B. ?Throughout the district, avoid cluttering building facades with brackets, wiring, 
meter boxes, antennae, gutters, downspouts and other appurtenances Where 
necessary, such features shall be colored so as to blend in, rather than contrast, 
with the immediately adjacent building exterior. Extraneous ornamentation which 
is inconsistent with the general design theme noted above, is also prohibited. 
C. ?Throughout the district, awning size, color and placement should complement 
the architectural character of the building. Soft, weather-treated canvas or vinyl 
materials, which allow for flexible or fixed installation, shall be used. Aluminum or 
suspended metal canopies shall be prohibited. Signage applied to awnings shall 
be simple and durable. Backlit awnings are prohibited. 
12. ?Exterior signage. The city council finds that having a cohesive sign ordinance is 
beneficial in advancing the revitalization of the city's downtown district. In order to 
better guide the redevelopment of the downtown overlay district so as not to lose the 
architectural uniqueness of the area, all signage which is located on the exterior of 
buildings or structures shall be compatible and harmonious with the general design 
theme noted throughout the downtown overlay district regulations. Signage located 
within this district shall be geared towards the pedestrian and less towards vehicle 
traffic. When wall mounted signage is used in combination with window signage, the 
reiteration of colors and design shall be used. In addition to signage that is compatible 
to each other, wall signs shall be harmonious in scale and proportion with the building 
they are mounted to and with the architectural elements of the building as outlined in 
the regulations. Signage shall not visually overpower architectural elements nor 
detract from the composition of the building. 
In order to further the goals of the downtown overlay district, signage located in the 
district shall: be compatible with their surroundings and the zoning district; be 
appropriate to the type of activity they advertise; and be expressive of the identity of 
the individual proprietors. Signage shall foster high quality development and enhance 
the economic vitality of existing businesses by promoting the reasonable, orderly and 
effective display of street graphics; and encouraging better communication between 
an activity and the public it seeks with its message. The downtown overlay district 
signage shall protect the public investment in streets and highways by reducing the 
obstructions and distractions that could cause traffic accidents and promote the 
convenience, enjoyment and free flow of traffic within the city. Signage shall assist in 
preserving the value of private property by assuring the compatibility of signs with 
nearby land uses and protect the physical and mental well-being of the general public 
by recognizing and encouraging a sense of aesthetic appreciation for the visual 
environment. 
Regulations found within article ten: Signs apply within the downtown overlay district. 
However, in the event of any inconsistencies, regulations found within this § [150.106] 
supercede those found within article ten: Signs. A signage photo book is available at 
the planning department to help illustrate the intent of the downtown overlay district 
regulations.

(1) ?Conventional residential development. This land use includes, but is not limited to, all 
residential developments which do not provide permanently protected natural resource areas. 
Property which is under common ownership of a property owners' association is permitted, but 
is not a required component of this type of development. Up to ten percent of a conventional 
residential development's gross site area (GSA) can contain natural resource areas which must 
be protected (or other permanently protected natural resource areas), without a reduction in 
maximum gross density (MGD). 
Conventional residential development can be made up of the following dwelling unit types (on 
the following pages):

than 50 percent of the front facade of the house in width. 
B. ?Garage setback: Garages shall be set back a distance equal with or further from the 
primary front facade of the house. This setback is not meant to prevent the garage from 
being setback a distance equal to a porch that is placed in the front of the house adjacent 
to the garage facade. The primary front facade shall be defined as the closest plane of the 
house facade that comprises 50 percent or greater of the width of the house, excluding the 
garage sections. 
C. ?Single-family detached (site built). A dwelling designed for and occupied by not more than 
one family and having no roof, wall, or floor in common with any other dwelling unit. This

Sec. 150.205. - Group developments. 
(A) ?Definition. A group development is a special use development containing: 
(1) ?Two or more structures containing principal land uses on the same lot, except for agricultural 
uses on lands zoned RH, and on lands zoned GB, GI or HI; 
(2) ?Any new institutional or commercial buildings in excess of 40,000 gross square feet. 
(3) ?Any building additions to institutional, or commercial buildings that bring the total building size 
to over 40,000 gross square feet. These regulations shall apply to the building addition, the 
older portions of the building constructed prior to the adoption of this section, and to the site. 
A group development does not offer the ability to customize the regulations of this zoning ordinance as 
could be achieved using a planned development per § 150.105(E). 
(B) ?Special use regulations. Any land use that is permitted as a permitted by right land use or as a 
special land use within the applicable zoning district(s) is permitted to locate within a group 
development. The detailed land use regulations of this subsection that pertain to individual land uses 
shall also apply to individual land uses within a group development, as will all other applicable 
provisions of this ordinance. Therefore, land uses permitted by right in the zoning district shall be 
permitted by right within an approved group development (unless otherwise restricted by the 
conditions of approval imposed during the special use approval for the group development as a 
whole), and land uses permitted as a special use in the zoning district shall be permitted within the 
group development only with special use approval for the specific use. In all cases, the following 
special use conditions shall be applied to the group development as a whole, and to individual uses 
within the group development: 
(1) ?All required off-street parking spaces and access drives shall be located entirely within the 
boundaries of the group development. 
(2) ?The development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to accommodate all trash and 
waste generated by the land uses in a convenient manner. 
(3) ?No group development shall take access to a local residential street. 
(4) ?All development located within a group development shall be located so as to comply with the 
intent of this chapter regarding setbacks of structures and buildings from lot lines. As such, 
individual principal and accessory structures and buildings located within group developments 
shall be situated within building envelopes that serve to demonstrate complete compliance with 
said intent. Building envelopes shall be depicted on the site plan required for review of group 
developments. The use of this approach to designing group developments will also ensure the 
facilitation of subdividing group developments in the future, if such action is desired. 
(5) ?The following standards shall apply to all group developments: 
A. ?Building exterior materials shall be of high quality on all sides of the structure including 
glass, brick, decorative concrete block, or stucco. Decorative architectural metal with 
concealed fasteners may be approved with special permission from the city. 
B. ?Building exterior design shall be unified in design and materials throughout the structure, 
and shall be complementary to other structures in the vicinity. However, the development 
shall employ varying building setbacks, height, roof, treatments, door and window 
openings, and other structural and decorative elements to reduce the apparent size and 
scale of the structure. A minimum of 20 percent of the combined facades of the structure 
shall employ actual facade protrusions or recesses. A minimum of 20 percent of the 
combined linear roof eave or parapet lines of the structure shall employ differences in 
height of eight feet or more. Roofs with particular slopes may be required by the city to 
complement existing buildings or otherwise establish a particular aesthetic objective. 
C. ?Mechanical equipment, refuse containers and any permitted outdoor storage shall be fully 
concealed from on-site and off-site ground level views, with materials identical to those 
used on the building exterior. 
D. ?Standard corporate trademark building designs, materials, architectural elements, and 
colors all shall be acceptable, as determined by the city, only as subtlety integrated into the 
more generic design of the building as a whole. Color schemes of all architectural elements 
shall be muted, neutral, nonreflective and non-use nor tenant specific. 
E. ?Public entryways shall be prominently indicated from the building's exterior design, and 
shall be emphasized by on-site traffic flow patterns. 
F. ?Loading areas shall be completely screened from surrounding roads, residential, office, 
and commercial properties. Screening may be accomplished by ensuring internal loading 
areas, screening wall that will match the building exterior in materials and design, fully 
opaque landscaping at time of planting, or combinations of the above. Gates and fencing 
may be used for security purposes, but not for screening, and shall be of high aesthetic 
quality. 
G. ?Vehicle access from public streets shall be designed to accommodate peak traffic volumes 
without disrupting traffic on public streets. The impact of traffic generated by the proposed 
development shall be demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis performed by the 
applicant's traffic engineer to not adversely impact off site public roads, intersections, 
interchanges during the traffic peak associated with a full parking lot. Where the project 
shall adversely impact offsite traffic, the city may deny the application, may require a size 
reduction in the proposed development, may require access control/consolidation of 
driveways to and from development, and/or may require off-site improvements. 
H. ?Parking lot design shall employ interior landscaped islands with a minimum of 360 square 
feet at all parking islands, and in addition shall provide a minimum of one landscaped 
island of a minimum of 360 square feet in each parking isle for every 20 cars in that aisle. 
Aisle-end islands shall count toward meeting this requirement. Landscaped medians shall 
be used to break large parking areas into distinct pods, with a maximum of 100 spaces in 
any one pod. 
I. ?A minimum of one 200 square foot cart return area shall be provided for every parking area 
pod. For commercial retail establishments, there shall be no exterior cart return nor cart 
storage areas located within 25 feet of the building in areas located between the building 
and a public street. 
J. ?The applicant shall demonstrate full compliance with city standards for stormwater, utilities, 
erosion control and public safety. 
K. ?On site landscaping shall be provided per the landscaping requirements of the city zoning 
ordinance except that building foundation landscaping and paved area landscaping shall 
be provided at 1.5 times the required landscape points for development in the zoning 
district. 
L. ?A conceptual plan for exterior signage shall be provided at time of detailed site plan or 
GDP that provides for coordinated and complimentary exterior sign location, 
configurations, and colors throughout the planned development. All freestanding signage 
within the development shall compliment the on-building signage. Freestanding sign 
materials and design shall compliment building exterior, and may not exceed the maximum 
height requirement of the zoning ordinance and Belvidere Municipal Code. 
M. ?The entire development shall provide for full and safe pedestrian and bicycle access within 
the development, and shall provide appropriate connections to the existing and planned 
pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the community and in surrounding neighborhoods, 
including sidewalk connections to all building entrances from all public streets. The 
development shall provide secure bicycle parking and pedestrian furniture in appropriate 
quantities and location. A central pedestrian gathering area shall be provided. 
(C) ?Discrimination against condominium forms of ownership. It is not the intent of this section, nor any 
other provision of this chapter, to discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any 
manner which conflicts with Illinois State Statutes. As such, the provisions of this section are 
designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same standards and 
procedures of review and development as other physically identical forms of development. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


ARTICLE 3. - DENSITY AND INTENSITY 


Sec. 150.301. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to indicate the maximum permitted density (for residential projects) and 
maximum permitted intensity (for nonresidential projects) of development on any given site within the 
jurisdiction of this chapter (see § 150.007). The development potential of any site is determined by a 
variety of factors, including but not limited to: 1) the area of the site; 2) the proportion of the site not 
containing sensitive natural resources; 3) the zoning district(s) in which the site is located; 4) the 
development option(s) the site is developed under; and 5) the use(s) considered for development. 
    Rationale: Article 3 regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this 
chapter. Article 3 is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city 
comprehensive plan (see also, § 150.003). Many of these are extremely difficult to address using 
conventional zoning techniques, particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to 
establish maximum permitted residential densities, and maximum floor area ratios to establish the 
character of nonresidential developments. Such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility and/or the 
needless destruction of sensitive natural resources. The approach employed by Article 3, relying on 
maximum gross densities (MGDs) and minimum required landscape surface ratios (LSRs) for residential 
development, and minimum required landscape surface ratios (LSRs) in combination with maximum 
permitted floor area ratios (FARs) for nonresidential development, (both in conjunction with a variety of 
development options available in every zoning district) results in a very high degree of site design 
flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community 
goals and objectives. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.302. - How to use article 3. 
    Article 3 contains the standards that determine the maximum amount of development permitted on 
any given site. Prior to using the provisions of article 3 to determine the development potential of a given 
property, the guidelines provided by § 150.303(A) through (C) should be reviewed. Article 3 recognizes 
inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses, and thus regulates their 
development in slightly different manners. The description of the process addressing residential 
development in § 150.304(A) and (B) refers to the residential density standards within each district 
located in article 1. The description of the process addressing nonresidential development in § 
150.304(A) and (C) refers to the nonresidential intensity standards within each district located in article 1. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.303. - Required natural resources site evaluation. 
(A) ?Purpose. An important goal of the city comprehensive plan is the protection of natural resources, 
which are sensitive to disruption caused by development and/or other land use activities. These 
resources include: Floodways, floodplain areas, floodfringe, shorelands, wetlands, drainageways, 
lakeshores, steep slopes, and woodlands. These resources serve important functions, which are lost 
when these areas are subject to development and/or other land use activities, in the absence of 
correct mitigation approaches. In many instances, these functions cannot be provided by other 
natural or man-made features. Specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and 
enhancement of air, surface water, ground water, and soil quality; habitat provisions and 
diversification; aesthetic diversification; and buffering effects. 
(B) ?Mitigation. In certain instances, natural features can accommodate development and/or other land 
use activities without a significant loss of their functional benefits if proper mitigation practices are 
employed. 
(C) ?Natural resources site evaluation worksheet. A natural resources site evaluation worksheet must be 
completed per the requirements described in § 150.304(A)(3).

A. ?Check comprehensive plan recommendations. The city's comprehensive plan should be 
checked for implications related to the subject property, particularly the land use and 
transportation plan maps (copies of the comprehensive plan are available from the city.) 
From time to time, the comprehensive plan may be amended. The city should be consulted 
regarding any changes to the comprehensive plan that may affect the subject property or 
its environs. 
(2) ?Check the zoning of the subject property. The potential amount and type of development any 
given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located. The 
subject property should be identified on the city's official zoning map (see § 150.103), and the 
current zoning designation should be compared with the description of that district provided in § 
150.105. The official zoning map is on display at the city's public works department and 
planning department. From time to time, the official zoning map may be amended. The zoning 
administrator should be contacted regarding potential changes in the official zoning map, which 
may affect the subject property or its environs. 
(3) ?Complete a natural resources site evaluation for the site. The effect of protected natural 
resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated. All 
resources listed in the natural resources site evaluation worksheet below should be identified on 
the subject property, located on a map (or air photo) of the subject property, and the total area 
of the property (in acres) covered by those resources, known as permanently protected natural 
resource area (PNRA), should be determined, as should gross site area (GSA) and the net 
developable area (NDA) of the subject property. The natural resource protection plan (§ 
150.503) shall be required in addition to this worksheet.

The Zoning Administrator should be contacted if assistance is desired in completing these calculations. 
(B) ?Instructions for only residential development. 
(For steps (1) through (3), see (A), above.) 
(4) ?Determine what types of dwelling units are permitted. Article 1 should be checked to determine 
which types of dwelling units are permitted within the zoning district for the subject property (§ 
150.204(A) describes each dwelling unit type). 
(5) ?Check the minimum site area requirement against the gross site area. The required minimum 
site area (MSA), given in the zoning district identified (b), should be compared with the gross 
site area (GSA) required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site 
evaluation in step (3), above. If the GSA is less than the MSA required by the selected 
development option, then a different development option must be selected, or additional 
property should be acquired. 
(6) ?Determine maximum gross density permitted on the site. The maximum gross density (MGD), 
given in the zoning district identified in Step (2), above, should be noted; and used in step (7), 
below. 
(7) ?Determine the maximum number of units permitted on the site. The maximum gross density 
(MGD), identified in step (6), above, multiplied by the gross site area (GSA) calculated in step 
(3), above, equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property 
under the selected development option within the selected zoning district. The ability to actually 
develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the 
provisions of this chapter. Inefficient site design, poor property configuration, and other factors 
may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site. 
(8) ?Check the minimum permitted lot area. The minimum lot area (MLA) requirement given in the 
zoning district identified in step (2), is the smallest size lot permitted within the zoning district. 
The MLA must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit 
proposed for the project in step (4), above. If the MLA given in the zoning district is larger than 
the lot size requirement given in step (4), then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be 
selected (in which case, it may be advantageous to repeat steps (4) through (8) using a different 
dwelling unit type). 
(C) ?Instructions for only nonresidential development. 
(For steps (1) through (3), see (A), above.) 
(4) ?Determine what types of land uses are permitted. Article 1 should be checked to determine 
which types of land uses are permitted within the zoning district designated on, or proposed for, 
the subject property. A complete description of each land use is presented in § 150.204. 
(5) ?Check the minimum lot area requirement against the gross site area present on the subject 
property. The required minimum lot area (MLA), given in the zoning district should be compared 
with the gross site area (GSA) required on the subject property as determined under the natural 
resources site evaluation in step (3), above. If the GSA is less than the MLA required by the 
zoning district, then additional property should be acquired. In other words, the GSA (from step 
(3)) must be greater than or equal to the MLA (from step (5)). 
(6) ?Check minimum landscape surface ratio requirement against the permanently protected natural 
resource area present on the subject property. The required landscape surface ratio (LSR), 
given in the zoning district identified in step (2), should be multiplied by the gross site area 
(GSA) used in step (5), above. The resulting product is the area of the site that must be 
permanently protected as green space. This area should be compared with the permanently 
protected natural resource area (PNRA) required on the subject property as determined under 
the natural resource site evaluation in step (3), above. If the area of the site containing sensitive 
natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required, then 
more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the 
site. In other words, if the RPA (from step (3)) is greater than the LSR, the use of more floors 
may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property. 
(7) ?Determine maximum floor area ratio permitted on the site. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) 
for the zoning district identified in step (2), above, should be noted. This number will be used in 
step (8), below. 
(8) ?Determine the maximum floor area permitted on the site. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR), 
identified in step (7) above, multiplied by the gross site area (GSA) calculated in step (3), above, 
equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property within 
that zoning district. The ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by 
the provisions of this chapter. Inefficient site design, poor property configuration, and other 
factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site. 
(9) ?Check the maximum building size requirement (NO and NB districts). The maximum building 
size (MBS) requirement given in the zoning district identified in step (2), above, is the largest 
size building permitted within the neighborhood office and neighborhood business districts. The 
MBS must equal or be greater than the building size proposed for the project in step (8), above. 
If the MBS given in NO or NB zoning districts (per § 150.105) is smaller than the proposed 
building size calculated in step (8) above, then a smaller building must be built, or the use of 
additional buildings should be considered. 
Rationale: The combinations of maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and minimum landscape 
surface ratio (LSR) requirements within each zoning district are designed to result in a 
consistent community character of development within that district. The minimum lot area (MLA) 
requirements for each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood 
character within each zoning district is maintained and attainable, under efficient site design 
practices. The maximum building size (MBS) requirements ensure that development within the 
neighborhood office and neighborhood business districts retain a neighborhood function and 
maintains a scale compatible with nearby residential development. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


ARTICLE 4. - BULK REGULATIONS 


Sec. 150.401. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of article 4 is to indicate the requirements for building location and bulk in both 
residential and nonresidential developments. The provisions of article 4 interact closely with the 
provisions of article 3, density and intensity regulations. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.402. - Residential bulk standards. 
(A) ?All residential lots created under the provisions of this chapter shall comply with the standards of 
this section. These standards are related to the specific zoning district used (see bulk regulations 
table in the appendix to compare the bulk regulations for all zoning districts.) 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.403. - Nonresidential bulk standards. 
    All nonresidential lots created under the provisions of this chapter shall comply with the standards of 
this section. These standards are related to the specific zoning district used (see appendix B, bulk 
regulations to compare the bulk regulations for all zoning districts.) 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.404. - Yard setback adjustments. 
(A) ?Front yard setback adjustment. 
(1) ?Exemption for established front yards. Where 50 percent or more of the frontage on the same 
side of a street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have front 
yards greater or lesser in depth than otherwise required, new buildings shall be erected no 
closer to the street than the average front yard so established by the existing buildings but may 
be erected using the average front yard so established. In CB, GB, PB, NO, and PO districts, 
the front yard need not exceed the specified front yard for the districts. 
(2) ?Front yards on corner lots. Where front yards have been established or may be required on 
each side of two intersecting streets, there shall be a front yard on each street side of a corner 
lot, with the following exception: In SF districts, where established front yards exceed 30 feet, 
only one front yard in excess of 30 feet shall be required. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.405. - Intrusions into required yards. 
    The minimum setback requirements of each zoning district establish the minimum required yards for 
all uses, except those exempted by the provisions of this section. 
(A) ?No yard shall be reduced in area or dimension so as to make such yard less than the minimum 
required by this chapter. If an existing yard is less than the minimum required, it shall not be 
reduced further, except where exempted by the provisions of this section. 
(B) ?In instances where the required bufferyard width (per § 150.607) exceeds the minimum 
required setback width, the minimum required bufferyard width shall prevail. Absolutely no 
intrusions of a building or structure, except fences otherwise complying with code, are permitted 
within the required bufferyard. 
(C) ?Permitted intrusions into required yards. The following intrusions by buildings and structures 
are permitted into the specified required yards:

Other similar structures or uses not listed may be classified in similar structure or use categories as 
determined by the zoning administrator and are permitted within the yard(s) identified in such categories. 
"P" indicates accessory structure or use is a permitted yard obstruction in the indicated yard as defined in 
§ 150.202(A). 
An accessory structure or use not listed in this table and not classified as a similar structure or use shall 
be considered a permitted yard obstruction unless otherwise specified in the zoning ordinance. 
If the requirements of this section are in variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted 
rules, regulations, or ordinances, the most restrictive or those imposing the higher standards shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.406. - Exceptions to maximum height regulations. 
    The maximum height regulations listed for residential and non-residential uses and accessory 
structures in each zoning district are the maximum permitted heights for all buildings and structures, 
except those exempted by this section, below: 
(A) ?The following are permitted to exceed the maximum height regulations by ten feet, within any 
district where permitted: church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes which do not contain 
useable space, public monuments, water towers, fire and hose towers, flag poles, chimneys, 
smokestacks, cooling towers, and elevator penthouses. Such uses may exceed said maximum 
by more than ten feet with the approval of a special use permit. 
(B) ?Any building or structure not otherwise accounted for by § 150.406(A), above, may exceed 
said maximum height regulations with the granting of a special use permit which specifically 
states the maximum permitted height of the proposed building or structure.

ARTICLE 5. - NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION STANDARDS 


Sec. 150.501. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to set forth the requirements for the protection and preservation of 
natural resource areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter. In part, the provisions of this article are 
designed to ensure the implementation of the adopted city comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.502. - How to use this article. 
    This article contains the standards which govern the protection, disturbance, and mitigation of 
disruption of all permanently protected natural resource areas. The provisions of this article are intended 
to supplement those of the city, the county, the state, and the federal government of the United States 
which pertain to natural resource protection. This article recognizes the important and diverse benefits 
which natural resource features provide in terms of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of 
the community. Each of the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type, and is designed 
to accomplish several objectives: 
    First, a definition of the natural resource is provided. Second, the specific purposes of the protective 
regulations governing each natural resource type are provided. Third, the required method of identifying 
and determining the boundaries of the natural resource area is given. Fourth, mandatory protection 
requirements are identified. Fifth, where permitted, mitigation standards are provided. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.503. - Natural resource protection standards. 
(A) ?Compliance. All new development (including building construction, other site improvements, and/or 
site preparation), additions to existing development (including building construction, other site 
improvements and/or site preparation), along with all new subdivision plats, condominiums, and site 
plans, in all zoning districts, shall comply with the resource protection standards set forth in Table 
150.503. 
(B) ?Natural resources to remain undisturbed. All of the natural resources required to be protected under 
this article shall remain undisturbed and in a natural state except those natural resources where 
mitigation is permitted and where that mitigation is in strict accord with those requirements set forth 
in this article. 
(C) ?Disturbance of existing natural resources. Removal of protected natural resources as defined in this 
article from a property before any development approvals from the city are sought shall not be 
allowed unless the property owner obtains a site plan approval and meets the standards of this 
article for natural resource preservation. All clear cutting and destruction of natural resource features 
shall: 
(1) ?Require a site plan review and approval as per § 150.906, and shall be in compliance with the 
provisions of this article. 
(2) ?Be required to meet the protection levels described in this article. 
(3) ?Where such clear cutting and/or destruction violations occur, be required to meet the mitigation 
standards set forth under the provisions of this article.

Footnotes: 
(1) ?Including residential PD districts (or residential portions thereof). 
(2) ?Including nonresidential PD districts (or nonresidential portions thereof). 
(3) ?Protection standards for steep slopes and woodlands shall be enforced over the total combined 
occurrences of such features on lands held in common ownership, rather than over each of any 
two or more individual occurrences of steep slopes or woodlands on such lands. Lands shall be 
considered to share a common boundary even if they are divided by a public road or navigable 
waterway, or if they connect at only one point. 
(4) ?Whether mitigation is permitted shall be determined by the zoning administrator on a case-by-
case basis. 
(5) ?If not otherwise restricted by state or federal regulations, the zoning administrator may allow 
the filling or alteration of up to one acre of wetland without mitigation if such filling or alteration is 
essential for public safety purposes as defined under state law. 
(D) ?Natural resource protection plan. If natural resource features defined and described in this article 
are present on a property, a "natural resource protection plan" shall be submitted with the site plan (§ 
150.906) which shall show the following: 
(1) ?Proposed name. The proposed name of the development. 
(2) ?Location. The location of the proposed development. 
(3) ?Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the owners, subdividers, lessee and/or 
developer. The names, addressees, and telephone numbers of the owners, subdividers, lessee 
and/or developer(s) of the property and of the designer of the plan. 
(4) ?Date. Date of the "natural resource plan" submittal and all applicable revision dates. 
(5) ?Site boundary. The boundary line of the site with dimensions and bearings, indicated by a solid 
line, and the total land area encompassed by the site. 
(6) ?Lot lines, right-of-way lines, and easements. The location of all proposed lot lines, right-of-way 
lines, and easements. 
(7) ?Existing streets. The location, ownership, widths, and names (if available) of all existing and 
previously platted streets, rights-of-way, parks, and other public or open spaces located within 
or adjacent to the subject property. 
(8) ?Easements and neighboring property boundaries. The location and dimensions of all 
permanent easements and the subject property boundary lines adjacent to the site. 
(9) ?Location and extent of existing natural resource features. The location and extent of any 
existing natural resource features defined and described in this article. Each individual resource 
area on the site shall be graphically shown on the "natural resource protection plan." 
(10) ?Disturbed and preserved natural resource features. Graphic and numerical illustration shown 
on the "natural resource protection plan" of those existing natural resource features that will be 
disturbed and those that will be preserved and showing on the illustration the area (in square 
feet or acres) of each existing resource and those areas of resources that are to be preserved. 
Numerical data may be shown in tabular form with labeled reference to specific areas 
designated on the "natural resource protection plan." Any areas of the site where natural 
resources are to be mitigated and how and where the mitigation is to take place with the natural 
resource protection easements shall be indicated. 
(11) ?Method of natural resource preservation. Graphic illustration and notes relating to how those 
natural resource features, which are to be preserved, will actually be preserved (conservation 
easements, deed restrictions, protective covenants, etc.) 
(12) ?Scale, north arrow, contours. A drawing legend containing the scale appropriate to the size of 
the site plan, the date of preparation, north arrow, and designation of existing and proposed 
contours at a maximum two foot counter interval. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.504. - Natural resource measurement. 
(A) ?Natural resources measurement. All land area within a proposed development, site plan, 
subdivision plat, or condominium consisting of the natural resource features defined in this article 
shall be accurately measured by the petitioner. The total square feet and acreage of each natural 
resource feature shall be multiplied by its respective "natural resource protection standard" as set 
forth in Table 150.503. to determine the amount of each natural resource feature to be protected by 
a conservation easement. If two or more natural resource features are present on the same area of 
land, only the most restrictive natural resource protection standard shall be used. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.505. - Natural resource features mitigation. 
(A) ?Intent of mitigation. The city recognizes that property owners, subdividers, or condominium 
developers may wish to develop in portions of those protected natural resource feature areas shown 
as eligible for mitigation in table 150.503. Provisions in this article set forth the conditions for 
mitigation and mitigation standards for the various natural resource features for which mitigation is 
allowed under the provisions of table 150.503. The intent of these provisions is not to permit greater 
destruction of natural resource features than is permitted under the requirements of this article for a 
typical property or development. This article sets specific standards for use when the extent of the 
natural resources on a site and the use of the regulations would create a major hardship for said 
natural resource feature protection. Thus, mitigation is intended to be used instead of a variance 
request when severe hardships would result from the strict enforcement of the natural resource 
protection standards and requirements set forth in this article. 
(B) ?Off-site mitigation. Off-site mitigation may be permitted if such off-site mitigation occurs within the 
same watershed as the natural resource feature or property being mitigated and follows the 
methods, requirements, standards, and/or criteria set forth under this article. All permitted off-site 
mitigation shall occur within the corporate limits of the city. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.506. - Steep slopes. 
(A) ?Definition. Three categories of steep slopes are defined herein for use in this chapter. These 
categories are based upon the relative degree of the steepness of the slope as follows: 
(1) ?Slopes of 20 percent to 30 percent inclusive. 
(2) ?Slopes greater than 30 percent. 
(3) ?No land shall be considered a steep slope unless the steep slope area has at least a 20 
percent vertical drop and has a minimum area of 5,000 square feet. 
(B) ?Purpose. Steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption, 
primarily related to soil erosion. Such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally 
disturbed. Such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil, results in exacerbated erosion downhill, 
and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways, wetlands, streams, ponds and lakes. 
Beyond adversely affecting the environmental functions of these resource areas, such sedimentation 
also increases flood hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system 
components, thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas. Beyond these 
threats to public safety, disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and 
slumping—unstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties, buildings, and public 
facilities such as roads and utilities. 
(C) ?Determination of presence. Steep slopes are to be determined by using the following sources 
and/or methods in the order indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or 
inappropriate, as determined by the zoning administrator, the succeeding source shall be used: 
(1) ?A topographic survey prepared by and certified by an Illinois registered land surveyor at the 
petitioner's expense at a contour interval of not less than two (2) feet. 
(2) ?Topographic maps on file with the city. 
(3) ?U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps. 
The area of steep slopes (in square feet or acres) shall be measured and graphically delineated on a 
topographic drawing and on the "natural resource protection plan." Such steep slope drawing shall 
graphically indicate those steep slope areas, by slope type, of the property pursuant to the "steep slope" 
definition set forth in this section. 
(D) ?Protection standards. Steep slope areas shall be retained to the extent shown on Table 150.503. 
Protected portions of steep slopes shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses 
permitted per the requirements of § 150.204(J). 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.507. - Woodlands and forest. 
(A) ?Definition. 
(1) ?Woodlands, young. An area or stand of trees whose total combined canopy covers an area of 
one-half acre or more and at least 50 percent of which is composed of canopies of trees having 
a diameter at breast height (DBH) of at least three inches. However, no trees grown for 
commercial purposes shall be considered a young woodland. 
(2) ?Woodlands, mature. An area or stand of trees whose total combined canopy covers an area of 
one acre or more and at least 50 percent of which is composed of canopies of trees having a 
diameter at breast height (DBH) of at least ten inches; or any grove consisting of eight or more 
individual trees having a DBH of at least 12 inches whose combined canopies cover at least 50 
percent of the area encompassed by the grove. However, no trees grown for commercial 
purposes should be considered a mature woodland. 
(3) ?Woodlands include all tree species listed as large, deciduous trees and evergreen trees as 
listed in appendix D. 
(B) ?Purpose. Woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions. These include atmospheric 
benefits such as removing air-borne pollutants, carbon dioxide uptake, oxygen production, and 
evapotranspiration returns. Water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates 
(particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus) and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and 
velocities. Woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources. Woodlands are excellent 
soil stabilizers, greatly reducing runoff-related soil erosion. Woodlands also serve to reduce wind 
velocities, which further reduces soil erosion. Finally, under proper management techniques, 
woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources. 
(C) ?Determination of presence. 
(1) ?The determination of woodland and forest boundaries shall be determined by using the 
following sources and/ or methods in the order indicated below. If the first source is considered 
inaccurate or inappropriate by the zoning administrator the succeeding source shall be used: 
A. ?A field survey of trees compiled at the petitioner's expense by a registered land surveyor 
and identified by a landscape architect, forester, arborist, or botanist with a professional 
degree in one of those fields of endeavor. 
B. ?The most recent one inch equals 400 feet aerial photographs prepared by the city. 
(2) ?Each woodland and forest area shall include the tree trunk and the area located within the drip 
line or tree canopy. The area of woodlands and forests (mature and young), in square feet or 
acres, shall be measured and graphically delineated on the "natural resource protection plan." 
Such woodland and forest area drawing shall indicate all woodland and forest areas of the 
property meeting the minimum size criteria established by the definitions of woodlands (mature 
and young) in this section. In cases where the drip line or canopy areas overlap, the areas of 
overlap shall only be counted once. In cases where drip line or canopy areas overlap property 
lines, the property line(s) are to be used as the boundary for the woodland or forest area, with 
only that portion of the drip line area located on the subject property counted toward the 
woodland or forest area. The location, size, and summary of species types of all healthy trees 
having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ten inches or greater that are located in woodland 
and forest areas within 25 feet of any proposed improvement and/or in woodland and forest 
areas to be demolished due to the placement of improvements or grading are to be graphically 
shown on the "natural resource protection plan" or submitted as a separate drawing. For the 
remaining undisturbed areas of the site plan, subdivision plat, or condominium only the outline 
of woodland and forest areas indicating whether they are mature or young woodlands is 
required. The "natural resource protection plan" shall include an estimate of the percentage of 
all healthy trees within each woodland or forest area that have a DBH of three inches or greater 
and ten inches or greater. 
(D) ?Protection standards. Woodland areas shall be retained to the extent shown on table 150.503. 
Protected portions of woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses 
permitted per the requirements of § 150.204(J). 
(E) ?Mitigation. Woodlands and forest areas may be mitigated under either of the following two 
alternative requirements applicable to the mitigation of woodland and forest areas, except that the 
zoning administrator may approve different sizes and types of plantings in mitigation areas where 
site conditions or context warrant: 
(1) ?Alternative 1: 
A. ?Mitigation shall include the planting of 1.25 acres of new woodland/forest for every one 
acre of disturbed woodland/forest for which mitigation is required. 
B. ?Mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlands/forests disturbed. Such mitigation 
shall consist of the planting of new woodland/forest areas, as specified above, using the 
following numbers of plants per acre of mitigated area: 
15 canopy trees, minimum 3.5-inch caliper* 
12 canopy trees, minimum 2-inch caliper 
250 canopy trees, minimum 4-foot high whips 
50 understory trees, minimum 5-foot high whips 
25 shrubs, minimum 12-inches high 
*Note: Each 3.5-inch caliper canopy tree may be substituted with two 1.5-inch caliper 
canopy trees. 
C. ?All mitigation shall be in addition to landscaping required under article 6. 
(2) ?Alternative 2: 
A. ?Mitigation shall include the planting of 1.50 acres of new woodland/forest for every one 
acre of disturbed woodland/forest for which mitigation is required. 
B. ?Mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlands/forests disturbed. Such mitigation 
shall consist of the planting of new woodland/forest areas, as specified above, using the 
following number of plants per acre of mitigated area: 
12 canopy trees, minimum 3.5-inch caliper* 
10 canopy trees, minimum 2-inch caliper 
200 canopy trees, minimum 4-foot high whips 
40 understory trees, minimum 5-foot high whips 
20 shrubs, minimum 12-inches high 
*Note: Each 3.5-inch caliper canopy tree may be substituted with two 1.5-inch caliper 
canopy trees. 
C. ?All mitigation shall be in addition to landscaping required under article 6. 
(3) ?The species of plants to be used in the mitigation of woodlands/forests shall be similar to those 
destroyed and a minimum mix of six species are to be planted. Acceptable species for 
woodland and forest mitigation are as indicated in table 150.507(D). The species of trees to be 
used shall be selected by a qualified professional approved by the city based on, among other 
considerations, topography and soil type. No more than 80 percent of the total number of trees 
planted for mitigation purposes, however, shall be of any single species. 
(4) ?The land upon which the mitigation is to take place shall be protected with a deed restriction 
and conservation easement as a permanent natural resource features conservation easement. 
(5) ?No tree cutting or removal, after the adoption of this Code, shall reduce the woodland/forest 
natural resource features protection requirements of this Code.

(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.508. - Drainageways. 
(A) ?Definition. A drainageway is a course of running water, either perennial or intermittent, flowing in a 
channel. 
(B) ?Purpose. Drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas. As such, 
drainageways serve to carry surface waters, supplement floodplain, wetland, and water storage 
functions in heavy storm or melt events, filter water-borne pollutants and sediments, promote 
infiltration and groundwater recharging, and provide a unique habitat at the land/water margin. 
Drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reduce the 
potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which 
are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement. 
(C) ?Determination of presence. Drainageways are to be determined by using the sources in the order 
indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the 
zoning administrator, the succeeding source shall be used: 
(1) ?A topographic survey prepared at the petitioner's expense by and certified by an Illinois 
registered land surveyor at a contour interval of not less than two feet. 
(2) ?Topographic maps on file with the city. 
(3) ?U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps. 
The area of drainageways (in square feet and acres) shall be measured and graphically delineated on the 
"natural resource protection plan." 
(D) ?Protection standards. Drainageways shall be protected as indicated on Table 150.503. protected 
portions of drainageways shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land use permitted per 
the requirements of § 150.204(J). 
(E) ?Mitigation. Drainageway mitigation may be permitted under the requirements of the Illinois State 
Statutes, and administrative rules promulgated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources 
(IDNR). If such statutes or rules do not provide sufficient guidance on required mitigation, the city 
shall require the preparation and submittal of a wetland mitigation plan by a professional wetland 
mitigation specialist, and the petitioner shall be responsible for all costs necessary for the city to 
conduct a professional review of the mitigation plan. In addition, a permit from the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers pursuant to the requirements of section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) 
and/or the IDNR shall be submitted to the city certifying that the filling has been approved and 
permitted by the Corps and/or IDNR. Alternatively, the applicant must obtain and provide to the city 
written correspondence from said agencies that a state or federal permit is not required, as a 
condition of city review. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.509. - Shore buffers. 
(A) ?Definition. All of the land area located within 75 feet inland of the ordinary high water mark of all 
ponds, streams, lakes, wetlands, and navigable high water mark of all rivers. 
(B) ?Purpose. Shore buffers serve to protect land/water margins from erosion due to site disruption. 
Because of regular contact with wave action, currents, and runoff, such areas are highly susceptible 
to continuous, and in some cases, rapid erosion. Shore protection also provides a natural vegetation 
buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy, and filters significant amounts of 
water-borne pollutants and sediments. Shore buffers also promote infiltration and groundwater 
recharging, and provide a unique habitat at the land/water margin. 
(C) ?Determination of presence. Shore buffers are to be determined as the land within 75 feet of the 
ordinary high water mark of all features shown on the USGS 7.5-minute topographic quad map as a 
"perennial stream" and parallel to that ordinary high water mark, where required. If the first source is 
considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the zoning administrator, the succeeding 
source shall be used: 
(1) ?A topographic survey prepared by and certified by an Illinois registered land surveyor at the 
petitioner's expense at a contour interval of not less than two feet. 
(2) ?Topographic maps on file with the city. 
(3) ?U.S.G.S. 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps. 
The area of shore buffers (in square feet and acres) shall be measured and graphically delineated on the 
"natural resource protection plan." 
(D) ?Protection standards. With the exception of the activities permitted below, shore areas shall remain 
in undisturbed state, except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of § 150.204(J). 
(1) ?Tree removal. 
A. ?Purpose. The intent and purpose of this subsection is to preserve the natural wooded 
areas that help comprise the city's character, maintain property values by improving and 
preserving the aesthetic appeal of the city through tree regulations, preserve the natural 
resources of the city and state, reduce the amount of erosion in the city due to tree 
removal, protect the quality of the waters of the state and the city, and protect and promote 
the health, safety and welfare of the people by minimizing the amount of sediment and 
other pollutants carried by runoff to surface waters due to the erosion of land not protected 
by a naturally wooded environment. 
B. ?Clear-cutting prohibition. 
1. ?Waterfront shoreland areas. In a strip of land 35 feet wide inland from the bulkhead 
line, no more than 30 feet in any 100 feet shall be clear-cut. Where the lot is less than 
100 feet, no more than 30 percent of this strip shall be clear-cut. Natural shrubbery 
shall be preserved as far as practicable and, where removed, it shall be replaced with 
other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion and 
preserving natural beauty. 
2. ?Tree preservation area. Except for circumstances identified under subsection (c), 
below, it is prohibited to remove any tree or cause any trees to be removed from the 
tree preservation area of each lot. During construction, no equipment movement, 
construction or placement of equipment or material storage shall be permitted in the 
tree preservation area. 
C. ?Cutting exceptions. 
1. ?Trees may be removed from the building activities area. This area shall be as small as 
possible, including the entire area affected by building, grading, and temporary 
material storage areas. In no case shall the amount of trees with a six-inch tree 
diameter removed within the building activities area exceed the following: 
a. ?80 percent of the total of such trees on lots of ¼ acre or less. 
b. ?60 percent of the total of such trees on lots of ¼ acre to one acre. 
c. ?40 percent of the total of such trees on lots of one acre to 2.5 acres. 
d. ?20 percent of the total of such trees on lots of 2.5 acres or more. 
2. ?Trees removed in excess of the above will require a tree removal permit. Conditions 
under which a permit may be issued include, but will not be limited to, the following: 
a. ?The tree is dead, dying or diseased. 
b. ?The tree is damaged or injured to the extent that it is likely to die or become 
diseased. 
c. ?The removal of the tree will enhance the tree preservation area and the health of 
the remaining trees. 
d. ?The removal of the tree will avoid or alleviate an economic hardship or hardship 
of another nature to the property or residences. 
e. ?The removal of the tree is consistent with good arboriculture practices. 
(2) ?Replacement trees. When in keeping with good arboriculture practices, replacement trees shall 
be planted for all removed trees. They may be planted in the tree preservation area or in the 
building activities area after the initial construction activities are completed. All replacement 
trees shall be planted within 30 days of final grading. The determination of good arboriculture 
shall be based on tree density and spacing of table 150.509(D). 
(3) ?Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be subject to a penalty per 
tree illegally cut or removed, which shall be determined by the assessed value of the trees 
removed. The assessed value shall be determined in accordance with the "Manual for Plant 
Appraisers," published by the council of tree and landscape appraisers, most recent edition. In 
addition, a replacement tree shall be planted, of equivalent caliper, to replace each tree cut 
illegally.

Sec. 150.510. - Isolated wetlands, lakes and ponds. 
(A) ?Definition. Isolated wetlands are those areas where water is at, near, or above the land surface long 
enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet 
conditions that are no longer under regulation by the Federal Clean Water Act administered by the U. 
S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). For "jurisdictional wetlands" under Corps regulation, please 
refer to the Corps website: http://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/co-r/index.htm. 
(B) ?Purpose. These provisions are intended to maintain safe and healthful conditions, prevent water 
pollution, protect wildlife habitat, manage flooding, protect personal property and real estate, and 
control building and development in wetlands no longer under regulation by the Federal Clean Water 
Act administered by the Corps. When development is permitted in isolated wetland areas, the 
development should occur in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts upon the wetland. 
(C) ?Determination of presence. Wetland areas shall be determined at the petitioner's expense by a field 
survey and mapping of plant material by a botanist with a professional degree in either botany or 
biology. The area of wetlands (in square feet and acres) shall be measured and graphically 
delineated on the "natural resource protection plan." 
(D) ?Protection standards. Wetlands shall be protected as indicated on Table 150.503. Protected 
portions of wetlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land use permitted per the 
requirements of § 150.204(J). 
(E) ?Mitigation. Wetlands mitigation may be permitted under the requirements of the Illinois State 
Statutes, and administrative rules promulgated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources 
(IDNR) under that section. If such statutes or rules do not provide sufficient guidance on required 
mitigation, the city shall require the preparation and submittal of a wetland mitigation plan by a 
professional wetland mitigation specialist, and the petitioner shall be responsible for all costs 
necessary for the city to conduct a professional review of the mitigation plan. In addition, a permit 
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the requirements of section 404 of the Clean 
Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) and/or the IDNR shall be submitted to the city certifying that filling has 
been approved and permitted by the Corps and/or IDNR. Alternatively, the petitioner must obtain and 
provide to the city written correspondence from said agencies that a state or federal permit is not 
required, as a condition of city review. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


ARTICLE 6. - LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERYARD REGULATIONS 


Sec. 150.601. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of article 6 is to provide the minimum landscaping, screening and buffering standards to 
protect and improve community appearance, mitigate the environmental and aesthetic impacts of new 
development, prevent the creation of nuisances and health hazards, implement the aesthetic 
recommendations of the comprehensive plan, and improve quality of life in the city. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.602. - How to use this article. 
(A) ?Article 6 contains the standards, which govern the amount, size, type, installation and maintenance 
of required landscaping. Each section of article 6 is oriented to a specific category of required 
landscaping. The landscaping requirements described in Article 6 of the Ordinance are cumulative in 
nature and are required for all new developments and building expansions, except single-family 
residential and agricultural uses. A "landscaping point" concept is used in Article 6 to provide a 
maximum amount of flexibility in terms of the selection of plant materials. 
(B) ?Applicability. Any use for which submittal of a site plan is required under § 150.906, or for which a 
variance is required, shall provide landscaping in accordance with the regulations of article 6, except 
for additions to existing buildings where insufficient dimensions exist on site. When expanding a 
development, if additions or enlargements are 50 percent or more of the square footage of existing 
uses, structures, or vehicular use areas, the landscaping requirements shall apply to the entirety of 
the site. If the additions or enlargements are less than 50 percent of the square footage of the 
existing uses, structures, or vehicular use areas, then only the building foundation and paved area 
requirements shall apply to the expanded structure or vehicular use area. 
(C) ?Depiction on required site plan. Where a site plan is required for any project under § 150.906, all 
proposed landscape plantings to be located on the subject property shall be depicted as to their 
location, type, and size at time of planting and maturity. 
(D) ?Calculating landscaping and bufferyard requirements. In calculating the number of required 
landscaping points under the provisions of this section, all areas and distances on which required 
calculations are based shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of square feet or linear feet. 
Any partial plant derived from the required calculations of this section (for example 23.3 canopy 
trees) shall be rounded up to the nearest whole plant (24 canopy trees). 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.603. - Landscaping points and measurements. 
(A) ?All landscaping requirements are stated in terms of the number of landscaping points required. 
The required number of landscaping points is dependent upon the type of land use, the zoning 
district, and the size of the development. A different number of points is awarded for each plant, 
depending upon its typical growth rate, its mature height, and whether it is a deciduous or 
evergreen species. Shrubs may be replaced with ornamental grasses and perennials; however, 
such replacement shall not exceed 50 percent of the required number of shrubs. A minimum 
installation size is required for each of these plant categories. These requirements are as 
follows:

(B) ?Measurement for landscaping requirements. A minimum amount of landscaping points, based upon 
the zoning district, is required for: 
(1) ?The linear feet building foundations; 
(2) ?The gross floor area of buildings on developed lots; 
(3) ?The linear feet of street frontage; and 
(4) ?The total combined area of paved areas. 
The following diagram illustrates the measurement techniques used to determine these requirements: 
 
Landscape Measurements 
Landscape measurements: Landscaping calculation equations for this example: 
Paved area = (P 1 × P 2 ) + (P 3 × P 4 ) + (P 5 × P 6 ) + (P 7 × P 8 ) + (P 9 × P 10 ) 
Street frontage = S 1 + S 2 
Building perimeter = F 1 + F 2 + F 3 + F 4 + F 5 + F 6 + F 7 + F 8 
Building floor area = (B 1 × B 2 ) + (B 3 × B 4 ) + (B 5 × B 6 ) 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 24H, §§ 7, 8, 9-8-09) 


Sec. 150.604. - Landscaping requirements for regular development. 
(a) ?Landscaping is not required for single-family (§ 150.204(A)) or agricultural (§ 150.204(B)) land uses. 
When expanding a development, if additions or enlargements are 50 percent or more of the square 
footage of existing uses, structures, or vehicular use areas, the landscaping requirements shall apply 
to the entirety of the site. If the additions or enlargements are less than 50 percent of the square 
footage of the existing uses, structures, or vehicular use areas, then only the building foundation and 
paved area requirements shall apply to the expanded structure or vehicular use area. 
(1) ?Building foundations. This section requires that certain buildings, or building additions, 
constructed after the effective date of this chapter be accented by a minimum amount of 
landscaping placed near the building foundation. 
A. ?Landscaping required by this section shall be placed so that at maturity, the plant's drip 
line is located within ten feet of the building foundation. Such landscaping shall not be 
located in those areas required for landscaping as street frontages, paved areas, protected 
green space areas, reforestation areas, or bufferyards. 
 
Sample Configuration Best Suited for Building Foundations 
B. ?For each 100 feet of building foundation perimeter, the number of landscape points 
identified in table 150.604 shall be provided on a prorated basis, and installed and 
permanently maintained per the requirements of § 150.609. 
C. ?Climax trees and tall trees shall not be used to meet this requirement. The intent of this 
section is to require a visual break in the mass of buildings and to require a visual screen 
of a minimum of six feet in height for all exterior perimeter appurtenances (such as 
HVAC/utility boxes, standpipes, stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes). 
D. ?Where the officially approved site plan depicts a future building extension, the foundation 
landscaping requirement shall be calculated by measuring the length of the total perimeter. 
However, foundation plantings need only be installed based on the landscape points 
calculated from the portions of the building perimeter that will not be affected by building 
extension. If this results in point requirements, which are not met through the initial 
planting, then a performance bond for remaining plantings shall be deposited with the 
building department. 
(2) ?Street frontages. This section requires that street frontages on certain lots developed after the 
effective date of this chapter contain a minimum amount of landscaping in those areas which 
abut the right-of-way of a public street. 
A. ?All landscaping used to meet this requirement shall be located within ten feet of the public 
right-of-way. In no instance shall such landscaping be located within a public right-of-way. 
Landscaping shall not impede vehicle or pedestrian visibility. 
 
Sample Configuration Best Suited for Street Frontages 
B. ?For every 100 linear feet of street frontage where a developed lot abuts a public street 
right-of-way, the number of landscape points identified in table 150.604 shall be provided 
on a prorated basis, and installed and maintained per the requirements of § 150.609. 
C. ?Shrubs shall not be used to meet this requirement. A minimum of 50 percent of all points 
shall be devoted to climax and/or tall trees and a minimum of 30 percent of all points shall 
be devoted to medium trees. 
(3) ?Paved areas. This section requires that paved areas on certain lots developed after the 
effective date of this chapter contain a minimum amount of landscaping within, or within ten feet 
of, the paved area. The intent is to require a continuous visual screen of parking areas from 
public rights-of-way at a minimum height of 40 inches. 
A. ?A minimum of 360 square feet of landscaped area, which shall be located within ten feet of 
the paved area, is required for the placement of every 100 landscaping points. Said area 
does not have to be provided in one contiguous area. Plants used to fulfill this requirement 
shall visually screen parking, loading and circulation areas from view from public streets. 
 
Sample Configuration Best Suited for Paved Areas 
B. ?For every 20 off-street parking stalls or 10,000 square feet of pavement (whichever yields 
the greater landscaping requirement) located in a development, the number of landscape 
points identified in table 150.604 shall be provided on a prorated basis, and installed and 
maintained per the requirements of § 150.609. A minimum of 30 percent of all points shall 
be devoted to climax and/or tall trees and a minimum of 40 percent of all points shall be 
devoted to shrubs. 
C. ?Parking lot design shall employ interior landscaped islands with a minimum of 333 square 
feet (or two parking spaces) at all parking isle ends, and in addition shall provide a 
minimum of one landscaped island of a minimum of 333 square feet in each parking isle for 
every 20 cars in that aisle. Aisle-end islands shall count toward meeting this requirement. 
Landscaped medians shall be used to break large parking areas into distinct pods, with a 
maximum of 100 spaces in any one pod. 
(4) ?Developed lots. This section requires that certain lots developed after the effective date of this 
chapter contain a minimum amount of landscaping. 
A. ?Landscaping required by this section is most effective if located away from those areas 
required for landscaping as building foundations, street frontages, paved areas, protected 
green space areas, reforestation areas, or bufferyards. 
 
Sample Configuration Best Suited for Developed Lots 
B. ?The number of landscape points identified in Table 150.604 shall be provided on a 
prorated basis for every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area, and installed and maintained 
per the requirements of § 150.609. 
C. ?The intent of this section is to provide yard shade and to require a visual screen of a 
minimum of six feet in height for all detached exterior appurtenances (such as HVAC, utility 
boxes, standpipes, stormwater discharge pipes and other pipes.)

Note 1: Landscaping is not required for single-family (§ 150.204(A)), or agricultural (§ 150.204(B)) land 
uses.  
Note 2: Shrubs may be replaced with ornamental grasses and perennials; however, such replacement 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the required number of shrubs. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 24H, § 9, 9-8-09; Ord. No. 164H, § 3, 12-3-12) 


Sec. 150.605. - Landscaping requirements for other permanently protected natural resource areas. 
(A) ?This section requires that each acre of other permanently protected natural resource area after the 
effective date of this chapter be planted with a minimum amount of landscaping. 
(B) ?For every one acre of other permanently protected natural resource area in a development, 200 
landscaping points shall be provided. In addition, adequate ground cover shall be provided to 
stabilize the soil. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.606. - Landscaping requirements for required reforestation. 
(A) ?This section requires that each area required to be reforested, be reforested and maintained in a 
manner appropriate to site conditions. 
 
Sample Configuration Best Suited for Reforestation 
(B) ?A detailed reforestation plan shall be submitted by the property owner and approved by the city 
prior to clear cutting. If the city desires, this plan shall be reviewed by a reforestation consultant 
chosen by the city, with funding for consulting services provided by the petitioner to the city. 
Rationale: The provisions of this section are designed to ensure that reforestation efforts required as part 
of woodland disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of 
the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.607. - Landscaping requirements for bufferyards. 
(A) ?Purpose. This section provides the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots 
developed after the effective date of this chapter. A bufferyard is a combination of distance and a 
visual buffer or barrier. It includes an area, together with the combination of plantings, berms, and 
fencing that is required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances. These nuisances can 
often occur between adjacent zoning districts. Such nuisances are dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, 
signs, and incompatible land uses, buildings or parking areas. 
Rationale: One of zoning's most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts that have 
similar character and contain compatible uses. The location of districts is supposed to provide protection, 
but in the city, this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as single-family 
residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this 
chapter. Bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses. 
(B) ?Required locations for bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located along (and within) the outer 
perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another. Bufferyards shall not be 
required in front yards. 
(C) ?Determination of required bufferyard. 
(1) ?Identification of required level of opacity. Opacity is a quantitatively-derived measure which 
indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property. The 
required level of opacity indicated by table 150.607(C)(2)A. is directly related to the degree to 
which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts. The 
required level of opacity is determined by the value given in the cell of the table at which the 
column heading along the top row of the table (representing the subject property's zoning 
district) intersects with the row heading along the left hand side of the table (representing the 
adjacent property's zoning district). The value listed is the required level of opacity for the 
bufferyard on the subject property. 
(2) ?Identification of detailed bufferyard requirements. 
A. ?If a proposed use adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a 
zoning district boundary, that use shall provide a bufferyard with the level of the opacity 
indicated in table 150.607(C)(2)A. 
B. ?For each level of opacity, a wide variety of width, landscaping point, berm, and structure 
combinations are possible. The requirements listed in table 150.607(C)(2)B. pertain to the 
number of landscaping points, the minimum bufferyard width, and the type of berm or 
fencing required within every 100 feet of required bufferyard. A variety of landscaping point 
options are available and may be mixed within distinct portions of the same bufferyard.

For properties zoned in the Rural Holding District (RH), refer to the Comprehensive Plan's Planned Land 
Use Map to determine the proposed zoning district for said property. For example, if the Planned Land 
Use Map recommends that in the future a property currently zoned RH should develop as Planned 
Business, one would use the Planned Business Zoning District to determine the required buffer yard 
opacity value.

* ?Fences contributing to landscaping requirements are not permitted along street frontages for 
nonresidential uses. Where used in combination with plant materials to meet bufferyard 
requirements, a minimum of 50% of all plant materials shall be located on the exterior side (the 
side away from the center of the subject property) of the fence. A building wall which does not 
contain doors (except those used for emergency exit) may be used to satisfy the required fence 
portions of the bufferyard requirements.

(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 164H, § 3, 12-3-12) 


Sec. 150.608. - Classification of plant species. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, plant materials are classified into 13 groupings: "climax tree," "tall 
deciduous tree," "medium deciduous tree," "low deciduous tree," "tall evergreen tree," "medium evergreen 
tree," "low evergreen tree," "tall deciduous shrub," "medium deciduous shrub," "low deciduous shrub," 
"medium evergreen shrub," "low evergreen shrub," and non-contributory plants. Species suitable for 
landscaping use and compatible with county climate and soil factors are listed in table 150.608, below. 
The zoning administrator shall review proposals for, and the applicability of, species not contained in this 
list and is authorized to approve appropriate similar species (see appendix D for a detailed listing of plant 
species and characteristics).

(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 24H, § 10, 9-8-09) 


Sec. 150.609. - Requirements for installation, maintenance and use of landscaped and bufferyard areas. 
(A) ?Installation. 
(1) ?Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material required by the provisions of this chapter shall 
be installed on the subject property, in accordance with the approved site plan (see § 150.906) 
prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for any building on the subject property, unless a 
performance bond or similar surety is deposited with the city. 
(2) ?Surety. 
A. ?If the subject property is to be occupied prior to the installation of all required landscaping 
and bufferyard material, the property owner shall sign an agreement stating the intent to 
install the landscaping with the required period. This agreement shall also contain a 
statement indicating that there are fines associated with not complying with this agreement. 
B. ?If a phase of development is approved per the requirements of this Code, required 
landscaping may be split into amounts which are applicable to each phase. 
C. ?The zoning administrator shall require a letter of credit, the establishment of an escrow 
account with the city, or such other surety acceptable to the city to ensure that the 
landscaping is installed in the event that it is not installed within the time established in the 
agreement authorized by subsection [(A)(2)A.] above. The escrow agreement or other 
surety agreement shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the city and shall grant the 
city the authority to draw upon the surety or escrow if the landscaping is not installed 
pursuant to the agreement referenced in subsection [(A)(2)A.] The city, or its designee, 
shall have the authority to enter upon the property subject to the surety or escrow and 
install the required landscaping without further permission from the owner. The city shall 
retain the right to enforce this zoning code, and the landscaping provision contained in this 
section, by any legal or equitable means. 
D. ?Governmental units to which these bond and guarantee provisions apply may, in lieu of 
said contract or instrument of guarantee, file a resolution or letter from officers authorized 
to act in its behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this article. 
(3) ?Tree preservation. 
1. ?All existing trees for which points are being requested must be identified by species and 
diameter at breast height (DBH) and shown on the landscape plans. 
2. ?Existing plant materials which meet the requirements of § 150.603 but do not qualify for 
bonus points as outlined in § 150.609(A)(3)3. may be preserved on the subject property. 
Following the completion of development, said plants may be counted as contributing to 
the landscaping requirements. 
3. ?Trees intended to be preserved that are double the minimum planting size shall be worth a 
total of 1.5 times the standard landscaping points as outlined in appendix D. 
4. ?At final inspection, landscaping discovered to have been damaged may not be counted 
towards the required landscaping and said points shall be replaced with appropriate 
landscaping. 
(4) ?All landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless 
such vegetation is already fully established. 
(5) ?The exact placement of required plants and structures shall be depicted on the required 
detailed landscaping plan shall be the decision of each property owner within the requirements 
of this section, except that the following requirements shall be met: 
A. ?Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters in order to maximize their chance for 
survival. 
B. ?Where a combination of plant materials, and/or berming and/or fencing is used in a 
bufferyard, the fence and/or berm shall be located toward the interior of the subject 
property and the plant material shall be located toward the exterior of the subject property. 
C. ?A property owner may establish through a written agreement, recorded with the register of 
deeds office, that an adjacent property owner shall agree to provide a partial or full portion 
of the required bufferyard on an immediately adjacent portion of their land, thereby 
exempting the developer from providing all or a portion of the bufferyard on his property. 
D. ?In no manner shall landscaping or bufferyard materials be selected and/or located in a 
manner that results in the creation of a safety or visibility hazard. 
E. ?The restrictions on types of plants listed in § 150.604 shall apply. 
(B) ?Maintenance. The ongoing maintenance of all required landscaping and bufferyard materials shall 
be a requirement of this chapter and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which 
said materials are required. This requirement shall run with the property and is binding upon all 
future property owners. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be considered a violation of this 
chapter, and shall be subject to any and all applicable enforcement procedures and penalties 
including, but not limited to affirmative equitable relief. 
(C) ?Use of required bufferyard and landscaped areas. Any and all required bufferyards or landscaped 
areas may be used for passive recreation activities. Said areas may contain pedestrian, bike or 
equestrian trails provided that: no required material is eliminated; the total width of the required 
bufferyard, or the total area of required landscaping, is maintained; and all other regulations of this 
chapter are met. In no event, however, shall swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, golf 
courses, or other such active recreation used be permitted in such areas. Furthermore, in no 
instance shall any parking be permitted in such areas, nor shall any outdoor display or storage of 
materials be permitted in such areas. Paving in such areas shall be limited to that required for 
necessary access to, through, or across the subject property. 
(D) ?Utility easements. Landscaping materials, fences and berms which are located within a duly 
recorded utility easement and/or a pedestrian easement shall not count toward meeting a 
landscaping requirement, unless authorized by the zoning administrator. However, the width of such 
areas may be counted as part of a landscaping requirement. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 2H, § 1, 1-5-09) 


ARTICLE 7. - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 


Sec. 150.701. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to indicate the requirements for access, visibility, off-street parking, off-
street loading, exterior storage, exterior lighting, vibration, noise, building design and construction, 
hazardous materials, satellite dishes, wind energy systems, fencing, and screening for all development 
occurring within the jurisdiction of this chapter (see § 150.007). It also includes design requirements for 
large developments. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.702. - Access standards. 
(A) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public rights-of-way so 
as to promote the safety and general welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for 
the provision of access to public rights-of-way in accordance with the utilization of various sites. 
(B) ?City approval required. Any and all proposed access drives on the subject property shall be 
depicted as to their location and configuration on the site plan required for the development of the 
subject property (refer to § 150.906). 
(C) ?Number of access points. 
(1) ?Each lot shall have not more than two access points on any street frontage adjacent to any lot. 
Said access shall require approval by the director of public works. 
(2) ?In no instance shall any lot be permitted more than one access point on any one street if its 
frontage on said street is less than 85 linear feet (as measured along the right-of-way line). 
(3) ?On arterial streets and in certain areas experiencing, or expected to experience, congestion 
and/or safety problems, access to a lot may be required to be located via an access point 
located on an adjacent property or another street frontage. 
(D) ?Residential uses. Residential uses shall not have access points onto a nonresidential collector or 
arterial street unless such street has the only available frontage. 
(E) ?Nonresidential uses. Nonresidential uses shall not have access points onto a residential street 
unless such street has the only available frontage. 
(F) ?Access near street intersections. No access point shall be located closer than 100 feet from the 
intersection of any two street rights-of-way unless such street is the only available frontage on the 
subject property. In all cases, access points shall be located as far from an intersection as the lot 
size permits. 
(G) ?Distance between access drives. The minimum distance between access drives serving the same 
property shall be 25 feet (edge to edge), as measured at the property line. A distance in excess of 
said 25 feet may be required if, in the opinion of the director of public works, present or projected 
traffic factors warrant a greater distance. 
(H) ?Angle of intersection with public right-of-way. All access drives shall intersect with any public right-
of-way at an angle of not less than 75 degrees, and shall intersect at an angle of 90 degrees 
wherever possible. 
(I) ?Distance from property line. The distance from an access drive to the property line of an adjacent 
property shall not be inconsistent with the zoning district standard as specified in § 150.105. 
(J) ?Width of driveways. All access drives shall have a minimum width of ten feet for one- and two-family 
dwellings. For all other land uses, access drives accommodating one-way traffic shall have a 
minimum width of 12 feet and drives accommodating two-way traffic shall have a minimum width of 
24 feet. All access drives shall have a maximum width of 30 feet for all residential uses, and 35 feet 
for all non-residential uses, as measured at the right-of-way line. Access drives may be flared 
between the right-of-way line and the roadway up to a maximum of five additional feet in either 
direction. 
(K) ?Traffic control. The traffic generated by any use shall be channelized and controlled in a manner 
which avoids congestion on public streets and other safety hazards. Traffic into and out of all off-
street parking, loading and traffic circulation areas serving six or more parking spaces shall be 
forward moving, with no backing into streets or pedestrian ways. Traffic control devices shall be 
required as determined by the director of public works. 
(L) ?Paving of access. All access approach areas located within a street right-of-way shall be paved to 
the satisfaction of the director of public works with a hard, all-weather surface, and shall be 
maintained so as to prevent the transport of gravel, dirt, or other eroded material from the subject 
property into the right-of-way. This requirement must be fulfilled before building occupancy, unless 
granted a time-specific extension in writing by the director of public works. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 957G, § 1, 4-7-08; Ord. No. 240H, § 6, 12-1-14) 


Sec. 150.703. - Visibility standards. 
(A) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public rights-of-way so 
as to promote the safety and general welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for 
the provision of vehicular visibility. 
(B) ?Requirement. In order to provide a clear view of intersecting streets to motorists there shall be a 
triangular area of clear vision formed by the two intersecting streets and a chord connecting said 
centerlines. The distance requirement for the vision triangle shall be 25 feet from the right-of-way of 
all intersections. Generally, the following standards shall apply: 
(1) ?No object or planting which obstructs sight lines over 2½ feet in height above the surface of the 
roadbed shall be allowed in a vision clearance triangle, except the following: 
A. ?Telephone, telegraph, and power transmission poles; 
B. ?Lines and portable equipment; 
C. ?Open-type fence (e.g., chain link or wrought iron fencing) not exceeding a height of four 
feet above the roadbeds and not encroaching closer that six inches to any public right-of-
way; 
D. ?The growing of flowers and shrubbery, providing that they shall not exceed 3½ feet in 
height above the roadbeds; 
E. ?Deciduous trees, providing that said trees shall not be planted closer than ten feet to the 
point of intersection of the rights-of-way lines. 
(2) ?No overhanging tree branches or foliage, which obstructs sight lines regardless of whether said 
trees are planted within the traffic visibility triangle, shall be allowed within the space between 
2½ feet and ten feet above the surface of the roadbed in a vision clearance triangle. 
(3) ?Enforcement of this subsection shall be upon complaint to the zoning administrator or zoning 
staff. 
(C) ?Depiction on required site plan. Except in the downtown where no requirement is imposed, any and 
all visibility triangles located on the subject property shall be depicted as to their location and 
configuration on the site plan required for the development of the subject property (refer to § 
150.906). 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.704. - Off-street parking and traffic circulation design standards. 
(A) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of public rights-of-way so 
as to promote the safety and general welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for 
the provision of off-street parking and circulation in accordance with the utilization of various sites. 
(B) ?Depiction on required site plan. Any and all parking and traffic circulation areas proposed to be 
located on the subject property shall be depicted as to their location and configuration on the site 
plan required for the development of the subject property. Each and every on-site parking space 
designed to serve as required parking shall not be located farther than 500 feet, except as permitted 
by the zoning administrator, of shortest walking distance from the access to all of the various areas it 
is designated to serve. A garage stall, meeting the access requirements of § 150.703(F)(4), below, 
shall be considered a parking space. Parking spaces for any and all vehicles shall be clearly 
indicated on said site plan. 
(C) ?Use of off-street parking areas. The use of all required off-street parking areas shall be limited to 
the parking of operable vehicles not for lease, rent, or sale. Within residential districts, required 
parking spaces shall only be used by operable cars and trucks. 
(D) ?Traffic circulation and traffic control. Site circulation shall be designed to provide for the safe and 
efficient movement of all traffic entering, exiting, and on the site. Circulation shall be provided to 
meet the individual needs of the site with specific mixing of access and through movements, and 
where required, shall be depicted on the required site plan. Circulation patterns shall conform with 
the general rules of the road and all traffic control measures shall meet the requirements of the 
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(E) ?Installation and maintenance of off-street parking and traffic circulation areas. All off-street parking 
and traffic circulation areas shall be completed prior to building occupancy, unless a performance 
bond acceptable to the city or equivalent for the installation of said improvements is deposited with 
the city, and shall be maintained in a dust-free condition at all times. In no instance or manner shall 
any offstreet parking or traffic circulation area be used as a storage area, except as provided for by § 
150.706(D) and (E). 
(F) ?Off-street parking and traffic circulation design standards. 
(1) ?Surfacing and marking. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas (including all 
residential driveways—except those within the RH district) shall be paved with a hard, all-
weather surface, to the satisfaction of the city engineer or director of public works. Said surfaces 
intended for six or more parking stalls shall be marked in a manner which clearly indicates 
required parking spaces. 
(2) ?Curbing. Passenger vehicle parking lots, including drive aisles and driveways, shall provide a 
six-inch curb and gutter of adequate height as approved by the city engineer or director of public 
works and which is properly located to ensure that no part of any vehicle will project beyond the 
required setbacks of this chapter. The city engineer or director of public works does not possess 
the authority to waive the required curbing. Truck parking lots do not require curb and gutter to 
be present. 
(3) ?Lighting. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas serving 13 or more cars shall be lit so 
as to ensure the safe and efficient use of said areas during the hours of use. The illumination 
level shall be between 0.2 and 1.0 foot-candles for said areas, and said illumination level shall 
not exceed the standards of § 150.707. 
(4) ?Access . Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway 
that is wide enough and designed to provide a safe and efficient means of vehicular access to 
the parking space without directly backing or maneuvering a vehicle into a public right-of-way. 
All off-street parking and traffic circulation facilities shall be designed with an appropriate means 
of vehicular access to a street or alley, in a manner which least interferes with traffic 
movements. No driveway across public property or requiring a curb cut shall exceed a width of 
35 feet for commercial and industrial land uses or 30 feet for residential land uses. Parking 
spaces located behind an enclosed garage and located directly off a through aisle shall be a 
minimum of 30 feet deep. 
(5) ?Signage. All signage located within, or related to, required off-street parking or traffic circulation 
shall comply with the requirements of article 10. 
(6) ?Handicapped parking spaces. Parking for the handicapped shall be provided at a size, number, 
location, and with signage as specified by state and federal regulations. 
(7) ?Parking space design standards. Other than parking required to serve the handicapped, every 
and all provided off-street parking space shall comply with the minimum requirements of table 
150.704(F)(8). The minimum required area of parking spaces shall be 180 square feet. All 
parking spaces shall have a minimum vertical clearance of at least seven feet. 
(8) ?Parking lot design standards. Horizontal widths for parking rows, aisles, and modules shall be 
provided at widths no less than listed in table 150.704(F)(8), and shown on the following page. 
Additional design standards apply to "group developments" (see § 150.205). 
(9) ?Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping shall comply with the requirements of the paved area 
landscaping requirements in § 150.604(A)(3).

1 Parking spaces located behind an enclosed garage and located directly off a thorough aisle shall be 
at least 30 feet deep. 
2 This dimension represents (AW) for one-way traffic. For two-way traffic, add 8.0 feet to a maximum 
(AW) of 24.0 feet. 
3 The dimensions shown are the minimum stall dimensions. The minimum required area of parking 
spaces shall be 180 square feet. The minimum stall width cannot be utilized with the minimum stall 
length. 
 
Typical Parking Layout Dimensions 
(G) ?Calculation of minimum required parking spaces. 
(1) ?General Guidelines for Calculating Required Parking Spaces. The requirements of § 
150.704(G)(3), below, shall be used to determine the minimum required number of off-site 
parking spaces which must be provided on the subject property. Requirements are generally 
tied to the capacity of the use; the gross floor area of the use; or the number of employees 
which work at the subject property during the largest work shift. The term "capacity" as used 
herein means the maximum number of persons that may be accommodated by the use as 
determined by its design or by the city's building code regulations, whichever number is greater. 
References herein to "employee(s) on the largest work shift" means the maximum number of 
employees working at the facility during a single given day, regardless of the time period during

feet of any property line. 
(5) ?Flashing, flickering and other distracting lighting. Flashing, flickering and/or other exterior or 
interior lighting which may distract motorists are prohibited. 
(6) ?Hours of illumination. Within one hour after closing of the store, completion of the final work 
shift, or completion of specific activities associated with an institutional use, only building 
mounted security lighting and up to 25 percent of all other outdoor lighting fixtures may remain 
illuminated. 
(7) ?Minimum lighting standards. All areas designated on required site plans for vehicular parking, 
loading, or circulation and used for any such purpose after sunset shall provide artificial 
illumination in such areas at a minimum intensity of 0.2 foot-candles. 
(8) ?Street lighting. Street lighting shall conform to the standards set forth by the state for state and 
federal highways, the county for county highways, and the city for other streets and highways 
located within the city. 
(9) ?Temporary security lighting. Temporary security lighting triggered by motion or noise shall be 
permitted and exempt from the above provisions. Sensors for such lighting shall not be 
triggered by activity located off the subject property. Such lighting shall not remain on for more 
than 15 minutes beyond the triggering event. 
(10) ?Special events lighting. Any temporary use using exterior lighting which is not in complete 
compliance with the requirements of this section shall secure a temporary use permit from the 
city clerk's office (refer to § 150.905). 
(11) ?Nonconforming lighting. All lighting fixtures existing prior to the effective date of this chapter 
shall be considered as legal conforming structures. However, such fixtures are encouraged to 
be extinguished by 11:00 p.m. All replacement fixtures shall fully comply with the requirements 
of this section. Where nonconforming lighting is deemed to create a public nuisance by the 
zoning administrator, it shall not be subject to the protections of § 150.707 and may be ordered

inches) is adopted to: 
(1) ?Provide uniform regulation of all signal receiving antenna devices; 
(2) ?Secure placement of such antennas in an aesthetically sensitive manner while allowing users 
reasonable reception of signals; 
(3) ?Protect the public from injury from antennas that are inadequately mounted, unduly susceptible 
to wind pressure, improperly installed and wired, or are placed on structures insufficiently 
designed or constructed to safely support the antenna; and 
(4) ?Provide for placement of such antennas in locations that preserve access to rear property 
areas by firefighting apparatus and emergency personnel. 
(B) ?Definitions. 
(1) ?For purposes of this section, a "signal-receiving antenna" is defined as any apparatus capable 
of receiving communications from a transmitter or a transmitter relay located in a planetary orbit. 
This definition includes all types of signal receiving antennas, including, without limitation, 
parabolic antennas, home earth stations, satellite television disks, UHF and VHF television 
antennas, and AM, FM, ham and short-wave radio antennas, regardless of the method of 
mounting. 
(2) ?"Owner" means the holder of record of an estate in possession of fee simple, or for life, in land 
or real property, or a vendee of record under a land contract for the sale of an estate in 
possession in fee simple or for life but does not include the vendor under a land contract. A 
tenant shall be considered such owner to the extent of his interest. The personal representative 
of at least one owner shall be considered an owner.

comply with the following provisions: 
(1) ?Setbacks. 
A. ?Any signal receiving antenna and its mounting post shall be located a minimum of ten feet 
from any property line. 
B. ?Subject to the provisions herein, signal-receiving antennas shall only be located in the rear 
yard of any lot. If reasonable reception of signals is not possible with a rear yard placement 
due to the physical characteristics of the lot and area, the signal-receiving antenna shall be 
placed in the side yard of the lot. In the event that reasonable reception of signals is not 
possible by locating the signal receiving antenna on the rear or side yard of the property, 
such antenna may be placed in the front yard or on the roof of structures on the property. 
For corner lots, a side yard is only a yard that does not face a street. 
C. ?If side yard, front yard or roof mounting is requested, the zoning administrator shall 
determine where reasonable reception is possible, based on evidence provided by the 
person seeking to erect or construct the antenna. 
(2) ?Mounting. Signal receiving antennas attached to the wall or roof of any principal or accessory 
structure shall be permitted only if the structure is properly constructed to carry all imposed 
loading and complies with applicable state and local building code requirements. The zoning 
administrator may require engineering calculations. 
(3) ?Diameter. The diameter of the signal receiving antenna shall not exceed 15 feet in diameter for 
commercial uses or ten feet in diameter for residential uses, except for systems used to provide 
community antenna television services. 
(4) ?Height. 
A. ?A ground-mounted signal receiving antenna, including any platform or structure upon 
which said antenna is mounted or affixed, may not exceed 18 feet in height, as measured 
from the ground to the highest point of the dish. 
B. ?A roof-mounted antenna may not exceed 15 feet in height above the surrounding roof line 
as measured from the lowest point of the existing roof line. 
(5) ?Wind pressure. All signal receiving antennas shall be permanently mounted in accordance with 
the manufacturer's specifications for installation. All such installations shall meet a minimum

periods not exceeding five days. However, such trial placement shall be in accordance with all 
provisions of this section. Failure to comply shall result in a citation being issued for violation of 
this section. Any person making such temporary placement shall first give written notice to the 
zoning administrator of the date when such placement shall begin and end. 
(7) ?Advertising. No form of advertising or identification, sign or mural is allowed on the signal 
receiving antenna other than the customary manufacturer's identification plates. 
(8) ?Interference with broadcasting. Signal receiving antennas shall be filtered and/or shielded so 
as to prevent the emission or reflection of an electromagnetic radiation that would cause any 
harmful interference with the radio and/or television broadcasting or reception on adjacent 
properties. In the event that harmful interference is caused subsequent to its installation, the 
owner of the signal receiving antenna shall promptly take steps to eliminate the harmful 
interference in accordance with Federal Communications Commission regulations. 
(9) ?Aesthetic considerations. Signal receiving antennas shall be located and designed to 
reasonably reduce visual impact from surrounding properties at street level. 
(D) ?Enforcement. 
(1) ?It shall be unlawful to construct, use, build or locate any signal receiving antenna in violation of 
any provisions of this section.

made within 30 days if, in his or her judgment, there exists a deficiency in the structural stability of 
the system. 
(M) ?Inspections. A yearly inspection at a fee to be determined from time to time shall be made by the 
building inspector to certify the safety and maintenance of the WECS and accessory structures. 
(N) ?Removal required. For WECS that have not been in operation for one year, the owner or operator

(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.716. - Screening standards. 
(A) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate screening to minimize the visibility of mechanical 
equipment, refuse containers, and any permitted outdoor storage. 
(B) ?Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all mechanical equipment, whether building- 
or ground-mounted, refuse containers, and any permitted outdoor storage, as approved through the 
site plan review process. 
(C) ?Standards. 
(1) ?Mechanical equipment, refuse containers, and any permitted outdoor storage shall be fully 
concealed from on-site and off-site ground level views, with materials identical to those used on

square feet. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


ARTICLE 8. - NONCONFORMITIES 


Sec. 150.801. - Purpose and intent. 
    Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, here exist 
structures, and uses of land and structures, which were lawful before this chapter was passed or 
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter. These 
structures, and uses of land and structures, are declared legal nonconformities. 
    It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities until they are removed, but not to 
encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incomptatible with permitted uses 
in the districts involved. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.802. - Nonconforming use regulations. 
(A) ?Definition. A nonconforming use is an active and actual use of land or structures, or both; legally 
established prior to the effective date of this chapter or subsequent applicable amendment thereto 
which has continued the same use to the present, and which would not be permitted under the 
current terms of this chapter. 
(B) ?Continuance of a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use lawfully existing upon the effective 
date of this chapter may be continued at the size, intensity and in a manner of operation existing 
upon such date, except as specified in this section. 
(C) ?Modification of a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, or changed to 
another nonconforming use. 
(D) ?Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. 
1. ?When any nonconforming use of any structure or land is discontinued for a period of 12 months, 
or is changed into a conforming use, any future use of said structure or land shall be in 
complete conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
2. ?Exception by special use: In the event a legal nonconforming use has been discontinued for 
more than 12 months, a special use may be granted to allow continuation of that use pursuant 
to § 150.904, subject to the following conditions: 
(a) ?A special use to allow the continuance or reintroduction of a legal nonconforming use 
following a 12-month or more discontinuance of the use may only be granted for properties 
within the neighborhood business, planned business or general business districts. 
(b) ?The special use may only be granted if there has been no other intervening use of the 
property from the date the nonconforming use was discontinued. 
(c) ?The special use may only be granted if the application for special use is filed no more than 
36 months after discontinuance of the nonconforming use. 
(d) ?The special use may only be granted if the nonconforming use is a permitted use (either 
by right or by special use) within the neighborhood business, planned business or general 
business districts. 
(E) ?Maintenance of a nonconforming use. The normal maintenance of a structure or land containing or 
related to a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary repairs and incidental alterations 
which do not exacerbate the adverse impacts of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of 
this chapter. In no instance shall said repairs exceed over the life of the structure, 50 percent of the 
present fair market value as identified in the county assessment records of said structure or property 
prior to said repairs. Any nonconforming use in which repairs exceed the 50 percent fair market 
value as identified in the county assessment records shall be immediately discontinued and all future 
uses shall comply with this chapter. 
(F) ?Reconstruction of two-family dwellings in areas formerly zoned D or D-1. A legal, non-conforming 
two-family structure which is destroyed by fire, tornado or other natural disaster may apply for 
consideration as a special use to allow the reconstruction of the nonconforming structure. Any such 
structure shall only be reconstructed so as not to expand the floor area or footprint of the structure, if 
said structure is located in an area which was zoned to permit two-family dwellings on the day 
preceding the effective date of the ordinance. 
(G) ?Reconstruction of a single family dwelling in the CB, central business district. The owner of a legal, 
non-conforming single family residential structure (the structure), which was in existence prior to April 
16, 1956, and is located, at the time of application for a special use under this section, in the CB, 
Central Business District, may apply for consideration as a special use to allow the continued 
existence or reconstruction of the structure, if damaged or destroyed. Any such structure shall only 
be reconstructed so as to not expand the floor area or footprint of the damaged or destroyed 
structure. 
(Ord. of 3-6-06; Ord. of 848G, § 1, 9-5-06; Ord. No. 255H, § 1, 6-1-15; Ord. No. 421H, § 1, 9-4-
18) 


Sec. 150.803. - Nonconforming development regulations. 
    After the effective date of this chapter, any enlargement, expansion or extension of a nonconforming 
development must be developed in compliance with the provisions of article 3 unless a variance is 
granted by the planning and zoning commission per the requirements of §150.909. 
    Rationale: The adoption of the provisions of this section ensures that developments approved prior 
to the adoption of this chapter do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would 
otherwise be considered nonconforming. Typical examples of nonconforming developments include: 
exceeding the floor area ratio, not meeting the paved area setbacks, not meeting the landscape surface 
ratios, etc. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.804. - Substandard lot regulations. 
(A) ?Upon and after the effective date of this chapter, no lot shall be created which does not meet the 
minimum zoning district area requirements of each zoning district or the minimum lot area 
requirements of each zoning district or which does not meet the lot dimension requirements of each 
zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.805. - Nonconforming structure and building regulations. 
(A) ?Nonconforming structure and building regulations are also regulated under the city's building code. 
The standards set forth in this chapter are intended to be complementary to those in the building 
code. Where there is overlap or conflict between the two chapters, the more restrictive of the two 
shall apply. 
(B) ?Any structure or building lawfully existing upon the effective date of this chapter may be continued 
at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date, except as hereafter specified. 
(C) ?Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the building inspector from remedial or enforcement actions 
when said structure or building is declared unsafe. 
(D) ?When any lawful nonconforming structure or building in any district is modified so as to be in 
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, any future modification of said structure or building 
shall be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(E) ?Whenever a lawful nonconforming structure or building has been damaged by fire, flood, wind, 
explosion, earthquake, war, riot, unlawful act, or act of God, it may be reconstructed and used as 
before if it be reconstructed within one year after such calamity, unless the damage to said structure 
or building equals or exceeds 50 percent of its fair market value as identified in the county 
assessment records at the time of damage, as determined by the building inspector. 
(F) ?Normal maintenance of a nonconforming structure or building is permitted, including necessary 
nonstructural repairs (e.g. painting, siding, replacing appliances, etc.) and incidental alterations that 
do not extend, enlarge, or intensify the nonconforming structure or building. 
(G) ?Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful nonconforming residential units, provided 
such alterations do not increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building, except that a 
conforming garage may be added if none previously existed. However, after the effective date of this 
chapter, any enlargement, expansion or extension of a nonconforming structure must be built in 
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
Any structure or building for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of 
this chapter, which will become nonconforming under the provisions of this chapter or amendments 
thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided construction is started within 
365 calendar days of the effective date of this chapter, and provided that construction is completed within 
730 calendar days of the effective date of this chapter or amendments thereto. Said structure or building 
shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming structure or building. 
(H) ?If a structure containing a nonconforming use in a residential district is destroyed by any means, 
resulting in a loss of the legal nonconforming status, the owner of the property may petition for a 
special use to reconstruct the structure. Any such special use shall comply with all procedural 
requirements governing special uses and shall be granted only by the city council where the city 
council finds that because of the structure and property's location or unique situation, the structure 
should be allowed to be rebuilt and that the proposed structure and use will not be injurious to the 
public health, safety and welfare and will not conflict with the spirit and intent of this chapter. The 
structural design, site plan and building plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the city at 
the time of application for the special use. The proposed plans shall not increase the nonconforming 
nature of the prior structure and shall, upon approval by the city council, become a condition of the 
special use permit. 
(I) ?A structure or building that is nonconforming due to lot area or lot width may be rebuilt, remodeled, 
expanded out, or enlarged provided the change meets the other bulk requirements of this chapter for 
the district in which it is located.

contain all of the following: 
(1) ?A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the special use is proposed. Said 
map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the 
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be 
submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale not 
less than one inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, 
and a north arrow shall be provided. 
(2) ?A map, such as the land use plan map, of the generalized location of the subject property in 
relation to the city as a whole; and 
(3) ?The applicant shall provide justification for the proposed map amendment, consisting of the 
reasons why the applicant believes the proposed map amendment is in harmony with 
recommendations of the comprehensive plan, particularly as evidenced by compliance with the 
standards set out in § 150.903(D)(2), below. 
(D) ?Review by the zoning administrator. The proposed amendment to the official zoning map shall be

(3) ?The zoning administrator shall forward the reports to the planning and zoning commission for 
the commission's review and use in making its recommendation to the city council. 
(E) ?Reserved. 
(F) ?Public hearing procedures. The planning and zoning commission shall conduct a public hearing in 
accordance with § 150.910. 
(G) ?Review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning 
commission shall review the application, adopt findings of fact, and make a recommendation to the 
city council. In order to make a recommendation and adoption of findings of fact, the commission 
shall consider the following facts: 
A. ?That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use will not be unreasonably 
detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
B. ?That the proposed special use, both its general use independent of its location and in its 
specific location, will be in harmony with the purposes, goals, objectives, policies and standards 
of the city comprehensive plan, this chapter, and any other plan, program, or ordinance 
adopted, or under consideration pursuant to notice of public hearing by the city. 
C. ?That the special use will not in its proposed location and as depicted on the required site plan, 
result in a substantial or undue adverse impact on nearby property, the character of the 
neighborhood, environmental factors, traffic factors, parking, public improvements, public 
property or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the public health, safety, or general welfare, 
either as they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result of the 
implementation of the provisions of this chapter, the comprehensive plan, or any other plan, 
program, map, or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to notice of public hearing 
by the city or other governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide development. 
D. ?That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development 
and improvement of surrounding property, and maintains the desired consistency of land uses, 
land use intensities, and land use impacts as related to the environs of the subject property. 
E. ?That the proposed special use is located in an area that will be adequately served by, and will 
not impose an undue burden on, any of the improvements, facilities, utilities or services 
provided by public agencies serving the subject property. 
F. ?That the potential public benefits of the proposed special use outweighs any and all potential 
adverse impacts of the proposed special use after taking into consideration the applicant's 
proposal and any requirements recommended by the applicant to ameliorate such impacts. 
G. ?That such other factors that the commission deems pertinent. 
(H) ?Review and action by the city council. The city council shall consider the planning and zoning 
commission's recommendation regarding the proposed special use. The city council may approve or 
deny the special use as originally proposed, may approve the proposed special use with 
modifications or may remand the matter back to the planning and zoning commission for further 
discussion or hearing. The city council's approval of the requested special use shall be considered 
the approval of a unique request, and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed 
special use. 
(I) ?Effect of denial. No application which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall be resubmitted 
for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or 
proof of change of factors found valid by the zoning administrator. 
(J) ?Termination of an approved special use. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed special 
use meets all general and specific special use requirements in the site plan required for initiation of 
development activity on the subject property. Once a special use is granted, no erosion control 
permit, site plan approval, occupancy permit, or building permit shall be issued for any development 
which does not comply with all requirements of this chapter. Any special use found not to be in 
compliance with the terms of this chapter shall be considered in violation of this chapter and shall be 
subject to all applicable procedures and penalties. A special use may be revoked for such a violation 
by majority vote of the city council. 
(K) ?Time limits on the development of special use. The start of construction of any and all special uses 
shall be initiated within 365 days of their approval by the city council and shall be operational within 
730 days of said approval. Failure to initiate development within this period shall automatically 
constitute a revocation of the special use. For the purposes of this section, "operational" shall be 
defined as the granting of an occupancy permit for the special use. Prior to such a revocation, the 
applicant may request an extension of this period. Said request shall require formal approval by the 
city council and shall be based upon a showing of acceptable justification (as determined by the city 
council). 
(L) ?Discontinuing an approved special use. Any and all special uses which are discontinued for a period 
exceeding 365 days shall automatically terminate and any subsequent use previously allowed by the 
special use shall be a violation of this code. The burden of proof shall be on the property owner to 
conclusively demonstrate that the subject special use was operational during this period. 
(M) ?Change of ownership. All requirements of the approved special use shall be continued regardless 
of ownership of the subject property. Modification, alteration, or expansion of any special use without 
approval by the city council, shall be considered in violation of the zoning ordinance and shall be, in 
addition to any other remedies or penalties, grounds for revocation of said special use approval per 
(J), above. 
(N) ?Recording of special use requirements. Except for special use approvals for temporary uses, a 
certified copy of the authorizing ordinance, containing identifiable description and any specific 
requirements of approval, shall be recorded at the applicant's expense with the county recorder's 
office. 
(O) ?Uses now regulated as special uses which were approved as legal land uses—Permitted by right or 
as special uses—Prior to the effective date of this chapter. A use now regulated as a special use 
which was approved as a legal land use—either permitted by right or as a special use—prior to the 
effective date of this chapter shall be considered as a legal, conforming land use so long as the 
previously approved conditions of use and site plan are followed. Any modification of the previously 
approved conditions of use or site plan shall require application and city consideration for a new 
special use under this article. 
(P) ?Fees. One or more fees are required for this procedure. Refer to §§ 150.913. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 24H, § 15, 9-8-09; Ord. No. 51H, § 3, 3-1-10) 


Sec. 150.905. - Temporary use review and approval procedures. 
(A) ?Purpose. 
(1) ?The purpose of this section is to provide regulations that govern the procedure and 
requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed temporary uses. 
(2) ?Temporary uses are those uses that have the potential to create undesirable impacts on 
nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this chapter. In 
addition to such potential, temporary uses also have the potential to create undesirable impacts 
on nearby properties that potentially cannot be determined except on a case-by-case basis. In 
order to prevent this from occurring, all temporary uses are required to meet certain procedural 
requirements applicable only to temporary uses, in addition to the general requirements of this 
chapter and the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is located. 
(3) ?Land uses which fail to meet one of the requirements for temporary uses of § 150.204 may be 
reviewed as a special use (see § 150.202(B)). 
(B) ?Regulations applicable to all temporary uses. No public hearing is required to develop a temporary 
use, however, a demonstration that the developer proposes to meet all temporary use requirements 
of this article must be made at time of site plan application. Furthermore, no building permit shall be 
issued for any development that does not comply with all requirements of this chapter. Any 
temporary use must comply with other applicable codes, including but not limited to electrical, 
plumbing and fire codes. Any temporary use found not to be in compliance with the terms of this 
chapter shall be considered in violation of this Code and shall be subject to all applicable procedures 
and penalties. 
(C) ?Application requirements. All applications for proposed temporary uses, shall be approved as 
complete by the zoning administrator prior to certification of the proposed temporary use. Said 
complete application shall contain all of the following: 
(1) ?A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the temporary use is proposed. Said 
map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the 
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be 
submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale 
which is not less than one inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a 
graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided; 
(2) ?A map, such as the land use plan map, of the generalized location of the subject property in 
relation to the city as a whole; and 
(3) ?A written description of the proposed temporary use describing the type of activities, buildings, 
and structures proposed for the subject property and their general locations. 
(4) ?The zoning administrator may require a site plan of the subject property. Said site plan shall 
conform to any and all the requirements of § 150.906(C). 
(D) ?Approval by the zoning enforcement officer. Approval of a temporary use shall be by the zoning 
enforcement officer following review of said complete application per § 150.905(C) above. 
(E) ?Fee. A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to § 150.913. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 24H, § 16, 9-8-09) 


Sec. 150.906. - Site plan review and approval procedures. 
(A) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to specify the requirements and procedures for the review 
and approval of site plan applications. The provisions of this section are designed to ensure that all 
proposed land use and development activity complies with the requirements of this chapter. 
Specifically, this section requires that the initiation of all development activity (including building 
permits, zoning certificates, occupancy permits for a change of use of an existing lot or structure 
where there is contemplated a site plan revision, clear cutting, grading or filling) require the approval 
of site, building and operational plans by the city before the building, occupancy, and zoning permits 
can be issued—except, however, that development activity associated with an approved final plat of 
subdivision for single-family and/or duplex/twin home dwelling units, and development activity 
associated with the full and complete implementation of a project approved within the SIP phase of 
the planned development district (PD) is exempt from this requirement. 
(B) ?Procedure. 
(1) ?Initiation of request for approval of a site plan. Proceedings for approval of a site plan shall be 
initiated by the owner(s) of the subject property, or their legally authorized representative(s). 
(2) ?Pre-application meeting. The applicant may first meet with the zoning administrator and other 
applicable city staff to discuss preliminary concepts and plans for the development. Guidance 
will be provided to the applicant on technical requirements and procedures, and a timetable for 
project review may be discussed. 
(C) ?Application for site plan review. The applicant shall apply to the zoning administrator for the 
approval of a site plan. The zoning administrator may waive requirements at his/her discretion. Said 
complete application shall contain all of the following: 
(1) ?Written description of the intended use describing in reasonable detail the: 
A. ?Existing zoning district(s) (and proposed zoning district(s) if different);

I. ?Operational considerations relating to hours of operation, projected normal and peak water 
usage, sanitary sewer or septic loadings, and traffic generation; 
J. ?Operational considerations relating to potential nuisance creation pertaining to 
noncompliance with the performance standards addressed in article 7, including street 
access, traffic visibility, parking, loading, exterior storage, exterior lighting, vibration, noise, 
and hazardous materials. If no such nuisances will be created (as indicated by complete 
and continuous compliance with the provisions of article 7, then the statement "The 
proposed development shall comply with all requirements of article 7" shall be provided; 
K. ?Exterior building and fencing materials (§ 150.710 and § 150.712); 
L. ?Possible future expansion and related implications for § 150.906(C)(1)A. through J., above; 
and 
M. ?Any other information pertinent to adequate understanding by the city of the intended use 
and its relation to nearby properties. 
(2) ?A small location map at 11? × 17? showing the subject property and illustrating its relationship 
to the nearest street intersection. (A photocopy of the pertinent section of the city's land use 
plan map with the subject property clearly indicated shall suffice to meet this requirement.) 
(3) ?A property site plan drawing (and reduction at 11? × 17?) which includes: 
A. ?A title block which indicates the name, address and phone/fax number(s) of the current 
property owner and/or agent(s) (developer, architect, engineer, planner) for project; 
B. ?The date of the original plan and the latest date of revision to the plan; 
C. ?A north arrow and a graphic scale. Said scale shall not be smaller than one inch equals

4. ?Impervious surface area; 
5. ?Impervious surface ratio (Q.4./Q.1.); and 
6. ?Building height. 
(4) ?A detailed landscaping plan of the subject property, at the same scale as the main plan (and 
reduction at 11? × 17?), showing the location of all required bufferyard and landscaping areas, 
and existing and proposed landscape point fencing and berm options for meeting said 
requirements. The landscaping plan shall demonstrate complete compliance with the 
requirements of article 6 (note: the individual plant locations and species, fencing types and 
heights, and berm heights need to be provided). A detailed landscaping plan is only required 
where the site plan represents an expansion of 50 percent or more of the impervious cover on 
the site. 
(5) ?A grading and erosion control plan at the same scale as the main plan (and reduction at 11? × 
17?) showing existing and proposed grades, including retention walls and related devices, and 
erosion control measures per the approval of the city engineer. A grading and erosion control 
plan is not required when grading is not being done on the site. 
(6) ?Elevation drawings of proposed buildings or proposed remodeling of existing buildings showing 
finished exterior treatment shall also be submitted, with adequate labels provided to clearly 
depict exterior materials, texture, color and overall appearance. Perspective renderings of the 
proposed project and/or photos of similar structures may be submitted, but not in lieu of 
adequate drawings showing the actual intended appearance of the buildings (refer to § 
150.710.) An elevation drawing is not required when no new buildings are being built on the 
site. 
(7) ?A certified survey may be required by the zoning administrator in instances where he 
determines compliance with setback requirements may be difficult. The survey shall be 
prepared by a registered land surveyor and shall depict property lines and proposed buildings, 
structures, and paved areas. 
(8) ?A detailed site analysis per the following submission and review process: 
A. ?Purpose. The detailed site analysis required by this article is designed to provide the clear 
identification of permanently protected natural resource areas on a site which is proposed 
for development. A detailed site analysis is not required for sites that contain no 
permanently protected natural resource areas. The detailed survey work required to 
identify these areas accurately on a map is not required prior to the initiation of 
development concept plans for an area. A detailed site analysis shall be performed in 
conjunction with required land division documents or development site plans for any and all 
properties containing permanently protected natural resource areas. 
B. ?Description. The detailed site analysis shall be shown on a map of the subject property 
which depicts the location of all protected natural resource areas, as defined by the 
provisions of this article. The detailed site analysis shall meet the following requirements: 
1. ?Scale. A minimum scale of one inch equals 200 feet shall be used. 
2. ?Topography. Topographic information is not required for any property which does not 
contain steep slopes. For such properties, topographic information with a minimum 
contour interval of two feet is required. This requirement may be waived by written 
permission of the zoning administrator or his designee. 
3. ?Specific natural resources areas. All natural resources areas which require protection 
under the provisions of this chapter shall be accurately outlined and clearly labeled. 
Particular care as to clarity shall be taken in areas where different resource types 
overlap with one another. 
4. ?Development pads. The depiction of development pads on the site plan shall only be 
required on site plans where site disruption will affect permanently protected natural 
resource areas. 
A. ?All site disruption (including selective cutting) proposed to occur within 
permanently protected natural resource areas shall be limited to development 
pads. Development pads shall be depicted on the detailed site analysis map, site 
plans required for development permits, and the recorded plat of subdivision. 
B. ?Beyond visible damage to natural resources, vegetation, soil, and drainage 
patterns, site disruption activities shall not compact soil covering tree roots, or 
otherwise damage trees beyond the area from which trees are to be removed. All 
trees with calipers exceeding three inches, whose canopies are located adjacent 
to disturbed areas, which die within a period of five years following site disruption 
shall be replaced by the owner with a three-inch caliper tree of the same type 
(canopy or understory). Therefore, care shall be taken to ensure that equipment 
and actions associated with permitted site disruption activities are limited to the 
area in which they are permitted. The use of snow fences and other barriers to 
outline development pads during disruption activity is strongly recommended to 
limit the extent of inadvertent compaction or other disturbance of earth, and 
collision damage to vegetation intended for protection. Such barriers should be 
placed no closer to protected trees than a point on the ground directly under their 
outer canopy edge. 
5. ?Mitigation areas. All mitigation areas related to the provisions of this chapter shall be 
depicted on the detailed site map with notations provided which describe the 
mitigation techniques employed. 
C. ?Required procedure for submission and review. 
1. ?Required timing of submission. The detailed site analysis map shall be submitted to 
the zoning administrator for initial review prior to, or concurrently with, the submission 
of the preliminary plat of subdivision; or if the proposed development does not involve 
a land division then submittal is required as an attachment to a required site plan. A 
concept plan of the proposed development may be submitted prior to the submission 
of the detailed site analysis map; however, in no way does the acceptance and/or 
general approval of a concept plan indicate the approval of natural resource feature 
locations. A detailed site analysis map prepared for the subject property which has 
been previously approved by city staff may be submitted for any subsequent 
development activity on the site. However, modifications to such a previously 
approved map will be required if the analysis is no longer accurate for the subject 
property. 
2. ?Review by city staff. City staff shall review the submitted detailed site analysis map for 
general compliance with the following data sources: 
A. ?The official zoning map; 
B. ?Applicable USGS 7.5 minute topographic maps for the city and its environs; 
C. ?Air photos of the subject property; 
D. ?USGS Quads and other sources of topographic information; 
E. ?Applicable FEMA and related floodplain maps; 
F. ?Applicable federal and state wetland inventory maps; 
G. ?The city comprehensive plan; and 
H. ?Site visits. The zoning administrator shall provide the petitioner with a written 
evaluation of the submitted detailed site analysis map which shall indicate the 
acceptance by city staff; or the need for further analysis work, discussion with the 
petitioner and/or staff-recognized experts, or a joint site visit. 
3. ?Modification of detailed site analysis map. If necessary, as determined by city staff, 
revised detailed site analysis maps shall be prepared and submitted for review by city 
staff, until a version is deemed acceptable. Staff review of the detailed site analysis 
may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission as a matter of ordinance 
interpretation (see § 150.910 and § 150.911). 
4. ?Acceptance of detailed site analysis map. Upon notification of acceptance by city staff 
(or, in case of appeal, by determination of the planning and zoning commission), the 
petitioner may proceed with the submittal of necessary development documents. 
D. ?Integration of detailed site analysis information with required development and/or land 
division. Information contained on the detailed site analysis map relating to the boundaries 
of permanently protected natural resource areas (including natural resource protection 
areas, other permanently protected natural resource areas, and required mitigation areas), 
shall be clearly depicted on any and all site plans required as a precondition for application 
for any development permit (such as a building permit) and on any proposed plat of 
subdivision. 
(D) ?Initiation of land use or development activity. Except with the written permission of the zoning 
administrator, absolutely no land use or development activity, including site clearing, grubbing, or 
grading shall occur on the subject property prior to the approval of the required site plan. Any such 
activity prior to such approval shall be a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to all applicable 
enforcement mechanisms and penalties. 
(E) ?Modification of an approved site plan. Any and all variation between development and/or land use 
activity on the subject property and the approved site plan is a violation of this chapter. An approved 
site plan shall be revised and approved via the procedures described above, so as to clearly and 
completely depict any and all proposed modifications to the previously approved site plan, prior to 
the initiation of said modifications. 
(F) ?Sunset clause. All buildings on an approved site plan not fully developed within two years of 
approval shall expire, and no additional site plan development shall be permitted on undeveloped 
portions of the subject property. The city council may extend this period, as requested by the 
applicant, through the special use process following a public hearing. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06) 


Sec. 150.907. - Planned development district procedures. 
(A) ?Purpose. 
(1) ?The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and 
requirements for the review and approval, or denial, of proposed Planned Developments, and to 
provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying 
standard zoning district. 
(2) ?Planned developments are designed to forward both the aesthetic and economic development 
objectives of the city by controlling the site design and the appearance, density or intensity of 
development in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses, density, intensity, bulk, 
landscaping, and parking requirements. The planned development shall provide a much higher 
level of site design, architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional 
excellence than normally required for other developments. 
(3) ?Planned developments have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if 
allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this chapter. In addition to such 
potential, planned developments also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on 
nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan, 
landscape plan and architectural plan, and on a case by case basis. In order to prevent this 
from occurring, all planned developments are required to meet certain procedural requirements, 
in addition to the general requirements of this chapter. This process involves staff review and 
review for a special use per the requirements of § 150.904. 
(B) ?Provision of flexible development standards for planned developments. 
(1) ?Flexible development standards. 
A. ?Within the PD district, the standards for all development and allowed uses shall be those of 
the underlying zoning district(s) except where new or alternative standards are approved 
by the city. 
B. ?All aspects of development (including land use, density and intensity, bulk, landscaping, 
and parking and loading) must be depicted on the site plan required as part of a general 
development plan or specific implementation plan. All development aspects approved by 
the city as part of a general development plan or specific implementation plan shall be 
construed to be and enforced as part of this chapter. 
C. ?The PD process (specified in §§ 150.907(E) through (H), below) can be conducted 
simultaneously at the request of the applicant. 
(C) ?Initiation of request for approval of a planned development. Proceedings for approval of a planned 
development shall be initiated by: 
(1) ?An application of the owner(s) of the subject property or his/their designee; 
(2) ?A recommendation of the planning and zoning commission; or 
(3) ?By action of the city council. 
(D) ?Application requirements. All applications for proposed planned developments, regardless of the 
initiating party per §§ 150.907(C) above, shall be filed with the zoning administrator, who shall 
determine if they are complete. The zoning administrator shall forward copies of complete 
applications to the appropriate staff. Said application shall apply to each of the process steps in §§ 
150.907(E) through (H) below. 
(E) ?PD process step 1—Concept plan and pre-application conference. 
(1) ?The applicant shall provide the zoning administrator with a draft PD concept plan submittal 
packet for city staff review. A concept plan and pre-application conference is optional, but an 
encouraged first step prior to an application for a general development plan, particularly for 
larger and more complex PD projects. The concept plan submittal packet shall be provided in 
hard copy and electronic format acceptable to the city (Microsoft Word© or Adobe PDF©). The 
packet shall contain all of the following items: 
A. ?A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at 11? × 17?, as depicted on a copy of 
the city land use plan map; 
B. ?A conceptual plan drawing (at 11? × 17?) of the general land use layout and the general 
location of major public streets and/or private drives. The applicant may submit copies of a 
larger version of the "bubble plan" in addition to the 11? × 17? reduction. 
C. ?A general written description of proposed PD including: 
1. ?General project themes and images; 
2. ?The general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses; 
3. ?Approximate residential densities and non-residential intensities as described by 
dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio and impervious surface area ratio; 
4. ?The underlying zoning district(s) for the PD; 
5. ?The general treatment of natural features; 
6. ?The general relationship to nearby properties and public streets; 
7. ?The general relationship of the project to the comprehensive plan; 
8. ?The standard zoning district(s) that form the baseline zoning for the PD. 
9. ?An initial draft of density and intensity, bulk, landscaping, and parking and loading 
standards for the development that vary from those of the baseline standard zoning 
district(s). 
(2) ?City staff review. After receiving a complete draft PD concept plan submittal packet, the zoning 
administrator shall schedule a pre-application conference with the applicant and representatives 
from the city department of public works and fire department and others having an interest in 
the development proposal. 
(3) ?Pre-application conference. The applicant may engage in an informal discussion with city staff 
regarding the conceptual PD. Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the 
process shall be in no way be binding upon the city, but should be considered as the informal, 
nonbinding basis for proceeding to the next step. 
(4) ?Approval criteria. A concept plan shall demonstrate conformance with all of the following 
criteria: 
A. ?The comprehensive plan, other adopted plans and policies, applicable guidelines and other 
overlay districts; 
B. ?Adequate public services and facilities being provided to serve all development areas to be 
developed; 
C. ?Adequate circulation and access being provided to serve all development areas; 
D. ?Appropriate screening and buffering of adjacent property and uses being provided;

development area; 
F. ?An appropriate set of default or minimum standards for the entire property or development 
area; 
G. ?An appropriate phasing plan or development schedule for the entire property or for each 
development area. 
(5) ?After the pre-application conference, the zoning administrator may provide the applicant with 
written review comments from city staff. 
(F) ?PD process step 2—General development plan (GDP). 
(1) ?The applicant shall provide the zoning administrator with a draft GDP plan submittal packet for 
city staff review. The GDP submittal packet shall be prepared in tandem with the rezoning 
process or at such other time as requested by the city (for example, prior to an annexation). 
This submittal packet shall contain all of the following items: 
A. ?A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at 11? × 17?, as depicted on a copy of 
the city land use plan map. 
B. ?A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the special use is proposed. Said 
map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and 
the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments 
shall be submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be 
at a scale not less than one inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, 
a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided. 
C. ?A general development plan drawing at a minimum scale of 1? = 100? (11? × 17? reduction 
shall also be provided by applicant) of the proposed project showing at least the following 
information in sufficient detail to make an evaluation against criteria for approval: 
1. ?A conceptual plan drawing (at 11? × 17?) of the general land use layout and the 
general location of major public streets and/or private drives. The applicant may 
submit copies of a larger version of the "bubble plan" in addition to the 11? × 17? 
reduction;

staff; and 
4. ?Notations relating the written information provided in §§ 150.907(F), below, to specific 
areas on the GDP drawing. 
D. ?A general conceptual landscaping plan for subject property, noting approximate locations 
of foundation, street, yard and paving, landscaping, and the compliance of development 
with all landscaping requirements of this chapter (except as noted in the listing of 
exceptions) and the use of extra landscaping and bufferyards. 
E. ?A general signage plan for the project, including all project identification signs and 
concepts for public fixtures and signs (such as street light fixtures and/or poles or street 
sign faces and/or poles) which are proposed to vary from city standards or common 
practices. 
F. ?A general written description of proposed PD including: 
1. ?General project themes and images;

4. ?The underlying zoning district(s) for the PD; 
5. ?The general treatment of natural features; 
6. ?The general relationship to nearby properties and public streets; 
7. ?The general relationship of the project to the comprehensive plan; 
8. ?A statement of rationale as to why the PD is proposed. This shall identify barriers that 
the applicant perceives in the form of requirements of standard zoning districts and 
opportunities for community betterment the applicant suggests are available through 
the proposed PD. 
9. ?A general list of density and intensity, bulk, landscaping, and parking and loading 
standards for the development for the proposed PD and the location(s) in which they 
apply.

development objectives, covenants, conservation easements, or agreements that will 
influence the use and maintenance of the proposed development may be required for 
larger or more complex projects. 
11. ?Written justification for the proposed planned development (the applicant is advised 
to use the requirements of the special use procedure to develop said written 
justification). 
(2) ?Review criteria. After receiving a complete GDP submittal packet, city staff shall review the 
proposal. A GDP shall demonstrate compliance with all of the following: 
A. ?Provisions of § 150.907(E)(4), above; 
B. ?The applicable plat criteria in the city's subdivision ordinance; 
C. ?The special use review criteria outlined in the § 150.906(G); 
(3) ?Sunset clause. All portions of an approved PD/GDP not fully developed within five years of 
approval shall expire, and additional PD-based development shall require re-submittal of a 
GDP. The city council may extend this five years period by up to five additional years via a

operation of public works elements of the proposed development. 
H. ?The area included in a SIP may be only a portion of the area included in a previously 
approved GDP. 
I. ?The SIP submission may include site plan and design information, allowing the planning 
and zoning commission to combine design review and review of the SIP. Design review 
may, at the choice of the applicant, be deferred until a later time when specific site and 
building developments will be brought forth. 
J. ?The applicant may not receive a building permit until the SIP is approved. 
K. ?The planning and zoning commission or city council may specify other plans, documents or 
schedules that must be submitted prior to consideration or approval of the SIP, as such 
may be relevant to review. 
L. ?Review process. The process for review and approval of the PD shall be identical to that 
for special use permits per § 150.904 of this chapter and (if land is to be divided) to that for 
preliminary and final plats of subdivision per the Municipal Code. 
M. ?Sunset clause. All portions of an approved PD-SIP not fully developed within five years of 
final city council approval shall expire, and no additional PD-based development shall be 
permitted. The city council may extend this five years period by up to five additional years 
via a majority vote following a public hearing.

Sec. 150.908. - Downtown design overlay zoning district. 
(A) ?Purpose and scope. This district is intended to implement the urban design recommendations of the 
comprehensive plan by preserving and enhancing the aesthetic qualities (historical and visual) of the 
community, and by attaining a consistent visually pleasing image for various portions of the city. As 
emphasized by said plan, this district is designed to forward both aesthetic and economic objectives 
of the city by controlling the site design and appearance of development within the district in a 
manner which is consistent with sound land use, urban design, and economic revitalization 
principles. The application of these standards will ensure the long-term progress and broad 
participation toward these principles. 
(B) ?Designation of downtown design overlay zoning district boundaries. All properties having frontage 
on either side of the street along North State Street between West Madison Avenue and the 
Kishwaukee River; South State Street between the Kishwaukee River and West Second Street; and 
Logan Avenue between South State Street and South Main Street are included in the downtown 
overlay district, excluding the property located at the southeast corner of South State Street and 
Logan Avenue commonly known as 600 South State Street (Lots 1 through 5, Block 2 and Lots 1, 2 
and 10 and the east 33 feet of Lot 6, Block 6, Cohoon and Allens Addition); and excluding the 
property commonly known as 620-624 South State Street (the west 132 feet of Lot Six, Block Six of 
Cohoon and Allen Addition). 
(C) ?Powers and duties of the zoning administrator, and planning and zoning commission for all 
development. Proposed changes to the exterior appearance (no structural changes) of properties 
used exclusively for residential purposes are hereby excluded from the provisions of this section. All 
other development applications within the downtown design overlay zoning district are subject to one 
of the following three processes, as determined by the zoning administrator: 
(1) ?Applications which involve only a renovation of the exterior appearance of a property (such as 
repainting, re-roofing, residing or replacing with identical colors and materials approved by the 
city), or a change in the exterior appearance of a property in absolute clear and complete 
compliance with the provisions of § 150.106(C) (as determined by the zoning administrator), are 
subject to downtown renovation review by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator 
shall determine whether the petition requires only certification of thorough compliance with the 
technical requirements set out in § 150.908(D)(1) below; 
(2) ?Applications which involve only a change in the appearance of a property (such as painting, 
roofing, siding, architectural component substitution, fencing, paving, or signage), are subject to 
downtown design review and approval by the zoning administrator. 
(3) ?Applications which involve modification to the physical configuration of a property (such as 
grading, the erection of a new building, the demolition of an existing building, or the addition or 
removal of bulk to an existing building) are subject to downtown project review by the zoning 
administrator, and the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission 
shall serve as the initial and final review and determining body subject to appeal under 
administrative review act, on aesthetics, and shall focus its review on whether the application 
complies with sound aesthetic, urban design, historic and architectural practices pursuant to the 
procedures outlined in § 150.908(D)(3), below. In part, this effort shall be guided by the 
comprehensive plan. The planning and zoning commission shall serve as the initial and final 
discretionary review body, subject to appeal under administrative review act on site design, and 
shall focus its review on the application's compliance with sound land use, site design and 
economic revitalization practices. In part, this effort shall be guided by the comprehensive plan. 
(D) ?Procedure for review and approval. 
(1) ?Downtown renovation review. Applications which involve only a renovation of the exterior 
appearance of a property (such as repainting, re-roofing, residing or replacing with identical 
colors and materials approved by the city, or a change in the exterior appearance of a property 
in absolute clear and complete compliance with the provisions of § 150.106(C)(as determined 
by the zoning administrator), are subject to downtown renovation review by the zoning 
administrator. The zoning administrator shall serve to determine whether the application simply 
requires certification of thorough compliance with the technical requirements below. (Refer to 
the procedure summary chart at the end of this section.) 
A. ?Application requirements. All applications for renovation review shall be made to the 
zoning administrator, and, in addition, shall be accompanied by all of the following, in 
addition to the requirements for site plan (per § 150.906): 
1. ?A clear depiction of the existing appearance of the property. Clear color photographs 
are recommended for this purpose. Scaled and dimensioned drawings of existing 
components such as windows, doors, railings, fencing or other site components, 
and/or detailed building elevations which are proposed for alteration or replacement 
may be required by the zoning administrator; 
2. ?A clear depiction of the proposed appearance of the property. Paint charts, 
promotional brochures, and/or clear color photographs of replacement architectural 
components are recommended for this purpose. Scaled and dimensioned drawings of 
proposed components such as windows, doors, railings, fencing or other site 
components, and/or detailed building elevations which are proposed for renovation or 
replacement may be required by the zoning administrator; 
3. ?A written description of the proposed renovation, including a complete listing of 
proposed components, materials, and colors.

2. ?After the filing of a complete application, the zoning administrator shall review the 
application which: 1) shall evaluate its status as merely requiring downtown 
renovation review; and, 2) shall evaluate and comment on the written justification for 
the proposed alteration provided in the application per §§ 150.908(C)(1) above. The 
zoning administrator shall also evaluate the application based on the following 
question: 
How is the proposed alteration in harmony with the recommendations of the 
comprehensive plan, particularly as evidenced by compliance with the standards of § 
150.106(C)? 
C. ?Action by the zoning administrator. 
1. ?The zoning administrator may request further information and/or additional reports 
from the applicant. 
2. ?The zoning administrator may approve the application as originally proposed, may 
approve the application with modifications, may deny the application, or (where the 
proposal requires discretionary aesthetic judgment) shall forward the application to the 
planning and zoning commission as an applicant for downtown design review or 
downtown project review. 
3. ?The approval of the proposed renovation shall be considered as the approval of a 
unique request and shall not be construed as precedent for any other proposed 
alteration. 
(2) ?Downtown design review. Applications which involve only a change in the appearance of a 
property (such as painting, roofing, siding, architectural component substitution, fencing, paving, 
or signage), are subject to downtown design review by the zoning administrator. In part, this 
effort shall be guided by the comprehensive plan. The zoning administrator shall serve to 
determine whether the application simply requires certification of thorough compliance with the

(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 957G, § 1, 4-7-08; Ord. No. 303H, § 1, 8-1-16) 


Sec. 150.909. - Variance review and approval procedures. 
(A) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations which enable the city to hear and 
decide requests for permitted variation from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the 
public interest; where owing to special factors, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter 
would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be 
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
(B) ?Authorized variations . Variations are authorized for bulk regulations of structures, lots, setbacks, 
signage and fencing standards. A variation for the allowed principal land uses, allowable accessory 
uses, and/or permitted special uses shall not be permitted. 
(C) ?Initiation of request for approval of a variance. Proceedings for approval of a requested variance 
shall be initiated by an application of the owner(s) of the subject property, lease holders, or contract 
purchasers. 
(D) ?Application requirements. An application for a variance request shall be filed with the zoning 
administrator. No placement of the application on any agenda, as an item to be acted upon, shall 
occur unless the zoning administrator has certified that an application is complete. The applicant 
shall provide the zoning administrator with a complete application in both hard copy and an 
acceptable electronic format acceptable to the city (Microsoft Word© or Adobe PDF©. The zoning 
administrator may waive the requirement for the electronic copy. The number of copies is to be 
determined by the zoning administrator. Said complete application shall contain all of the following: 
(1) ?A map of the subject property showing all lands for which the variance is proposed. Said map 
shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the subject property and its environs, and the 
jurisdiction(s) which maintains that control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be 
submitted in a form which is clearly reproducible with a photocopier, and shall be at a scale 
which is not less than one inch equals 800 feet. All lot dimensions of the subject property, a 
graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be provided; 
(2) ?A map, such as the land use plan map, of the generalized location of the subject property in 
relation to the city as a whole; 
(3) ?A written description of the proposed variance describing the type of specific requirements of 
the variance proposed for the subject property; 
(4) ?A site plan of the subject property as proposed for development. Said site plan shall conform to 
any and all the requirements of §§ 150.906(C); and 
(5) ?Written justification for the requested variance consisting of the reasons why the applicant 
believes the proposed variance is appropriate, particularly as evidenced by compliance with the 
standard set out in §§ 150.909(D)(2), below. 
(E) ?Review by the zoning administrator. The requested variance shall be reviewed by the zoning 
administrator as follows: 
(1) ?The zoning administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and fulfills the 
requirements of this chapter. If the zoning administrator determines that the application is not 
complete or does not fulfill the requirements of this chapter, he shall return the application to the 
applicant. 
(2) ?The zoning administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written 
justification for the proposed variance. The zoning administrator shall evaluate the application to 
determine whether the requested is in harmony with state statute and this code and the city's 
comprehensive plan. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the 
planning and zoning commission unless the variance will not be contrary to the public interest 
and where owing to conditions peculiar to the property, and not the result of the actions of the 
applicant, a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. 
A variation shall not be granted unless, after a public hearing, the commission finds facts 
sufficient to support each of the foregoing and following findings. 
A. ?Special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land, structure or 
building involved and are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same 
district. 
B. ?A particular hardship or difficulty shall have arisen because of the unusual shape of the 
original acreage parcel; unusual topography or elevation; or because the lot was 
platted/created before the passage of the current, applicable zoning regulations, and is not 
economically suitable for a permitted use or will not accommodate a structure of 
reasonable design for a permitted use if all area, yard, green space, and setback 
requirements are observed; 
C. ?The hardships or difficulties do not result from the actions of the applicant. Reductions 
resulting from the sale of portions of a property reducing the remainder of said property 
below buildable size or cutting-off existing access to a public right-of-way or deed 
restrictions imposed by the owner's predecessor in title are considered to be such self-
imposed hardships; 
D. ?Granting the variation requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that 
is denied by this subsection to the owners of other lands, structures or buildings in the 
same district. 
E. ?The variation is the minimum variation that will make possible the reasonable use of land, 
structure or building. 
F. ?The property cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the 
regulations allowed in the applicable zoning district. 
G. ?The granting of the variation will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this 
chapter, will not be injurious to the neighborhood, will not impair the adequate supply of 
light and air to adjacent property, will not unreasonably increase the congestion in public 
streets, will not unreasonably diminish property values within the surrounding area, or 
otherwise be detrimental to the public interest. 
(3) ?Loss of profit or pecuniary hardship shall not, in and of itself, be grounds for a variance 
(4) ?Violations by, or variances granted to, neighboring properties shall not justify a variance; 
(5) ?The zoning administrator shall forward the report and recommendations to the planning and 
zoning commission for the commission's review and action. 
(F) ?Reserved. 
(G) ?Public hearing procedures. The planning and zoning commission shall conduct the meeting in 
accordance with § 150.910. 
(H) ?Review and determination by planning and zoning commission. After the holding of the public 
hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall make and adopt findings of fact and make its 
determination regarding the application as a whole. The planning and zoning commission may 
request further information and/or additional reports from the zoning administrator and/or the 
applicant. The planning and zoning commission may take final action on said request for approval of 
the requested variance at time of its initial meeting, or said proceedings may be continued from time-
to-time for further consideration. 
(I) ?Effect of denial. No application for a variance which has been denied (either wholly or in part) shall 
be resubmitted for a period of 12 months from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of 
new evidence or proof of change of factors found valid by the zoning administrator. 
(J) ?Limited effect of a variance. Where the planning and zoning commission has granted a variance, 
such approval shall neither change the use classification of the building or premises, nor give it any 
status as a nonconforming use other than that which it has as a result of the variance. Granting of a 
variance shall be considered as unique to the variance granted, and shall not be construed as 
precedent for any other proposed variance. 
(K) ?Fee. A fee is required for this procedure. Refer to § 150.913. 
(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 24H, § 18, 9-8-09; Ord. No. 51H, § 4, 3-1-10; Ord. No. 
240H, § 9, 12-1-14) 


Sec. 150.910. - Public hearing procedures. 
(A) ?Scope. All public hearings, proceedings and applications before the planning and zoning 
commission (the commission) shall be conducted and processed in accordance with this section. 
(B) ?Chairman. The chair of the commission shall preside over the public hearing and may impose 
reasonable limitations on evidence or testimony, including but not limited to, reasonable time limits. 
The commission shall not be bound by strict rules of evidence. However, irrelevant, immaterial or 
unduly repetitious evidence shall not be admissible. The city may appoint a hearing officer to assist 
the chair or to rule on evidentiary matters. 
(C) ?Court reporter required. A certified court reporter shall record all public hearings before the 
commission. It is the responsibility of the applicant for the relief requested to provide the court 
reporter and the cost of the court reporter and all transcripts shall be borne by the applicant. The 
zoning administrator may, at his discretion, waive the requirement for a court reporter. 
(D) ?Public hearing notice. 
(1) ?Within a reasonable time following receipt of all papers and documents relating to an 
application for special use, variance, planned development or applicant for amendment of the 
regulations or zoning district boundaries established by this chapter there shall be published in 
a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Belvidere a notice of the time and place of a 
public hearing thereon. Notice shall be published not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days 
before the hearing date and, except in the case of a petition to only amend the text of this Code 
shall contain the common address, a brief legal description of the property for the variation, 
ruling or recommendation is sought, the property index number (PIN) and a brief description of 
the nature of the matter to be heard. 
(2) ?Except in the case of a text amendment, notice shall also be mailed to the individuals who last 
paid taxes on all property within 250 feet of the subject property of the petition (exclusive of 
rights-of-ways). Said notices shall be mailed, by certified mail (with return receipt) by the 
petitioner, not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days before the hearing date. All return 
receipts shall be submitted to the director of the planning department prior to the public hearing. 
(3) ?In addition to the other notices provided for herein, the petitioner shall post notice of said 
hearing by the erection of a sign to be provided by the city, on the subject property for a period 
of not less than 15 continuous days immediately preceding the date of the hearing and not more 
than 30 days before. The required sign shall be posted in a conspicuous place allowing 
unobstructed public viewing. A sign deposit fee may be required. 
(E) ?Interested party participation. Any interested party may participate in the public hearing. An 
interested party shall include, the applicant, the city, any citizen of the city or a person owning real 
property, or any other person living within 250 feet of the property which is the subject of the public 
hearing. 
(1) ?Any interested party may appear, present evidence and cross-examine witnesses at a public 
hearing. 
(2) ?The chair of the commission may establish reasonable rules for establishing those who wish to 
participate as interested parties, including, but not limited to, requiring registration prior to the 
start of the public hearing. 
(F) ?Proceedings.

pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 286(b). 
(2) ?At least 15 days prior to the public hearing, the applicant shall file a pre-hearing memo with the 
zoning administrator identifying all witnesses and evidence the applicant will introduce at the 
public hearing, including the subject matter of all testimony. The zoning administrator shall 
provide a copy of the pre-hearing memo to the city attorney and mayor. The city may use the 
pre-hearing memo to prepare for the public hearing. If the pre-hearing memo is not timely filed, 
the planning and zoning commission may continue the public hearing to a time after the pre-
hearing memo is actually filed. 
(3) ?At the commencement of the public hearing, the chair or his or her designee shall read into the 
record, proof of lawful notice (e.g. the chair shall signify that any required publication was 
completed, along with the date of the publication, and a declaration that the chair is in 
possession of proof that all required certified mailings were indeed mailed). 
(4) ?All witnesses appearing at the public hearing and offering testimony, including but not limited 
to, city staff presenting evidence, shall be sworn under oath. An attorney, who merely questions 
witnesses, summarizes testimony and makes an argument to the planning and zoning 
commission based upon the evidence shall not be sworn. However, if the attorney provides 
testimony or evidence, the attorney shall be sworn under oath. 
(5) ?At the public hearing, the applicant may make an opening statement. The city may also make 
an opening statement at this time or reserve opening until its case in chief. Thereafter, the 
applicant shall present its witnesses and evidence. 
A. ?All exhibits shall be appropriately marked for easy identification (e.g. applicant's exhibit 1). 
A reasonable foundation for each exhibit shall be provided before being admitted into

interested party may make an opening statement and present evidence and witnesses. Each 
interested party shall identify his or herself and state their address. The applicant and the city 
may cross-examine any witness. 
(7) ?After all interested parties, who wish to present evidence, have rested, the city may, but is not 
obligated to, make an opening statement and present evidence and witnesses. The applicant 
and any interested party may cross-examine the city's witnesses. In the interest of brevity and 
clarity, the chair may provide that the city present its summary and evidence first, prior to the 
applicant. 
(8) ?The commission may question any witness on any matter pertaining to the public hearing. If the 
commission does question a witness, all parties may cross-examine the witness based upon the 
testimony elicited. 
(9) ?The chair shall grant any reasonable request or motion by the city or the commission for a 
continuance. 
(10) ?After the city has completed presenting its evidence, the applicant may present rebuttal 
evidence subject to cross-examination and a closing statement. 
(11) ?Thereafter, the chair shall close the public hearing. The commission shall not render any 
decision or recommendations until the public hearing is closed. 
(12) ?The chair may order reasonable deviations from these hearing procedures in order to promote 
efficiency, so long as the applicant or any interested party is not unduly prejudiced. 
(G) ?Decisions/recommendations. 
(1) ?In rendering a decision or recommendation, the commission shall only consider the evidence, 
testimony and argument presented as a part of the public hearing and accepted into evidence, 
as well as information generally known by the commission. 
(2) ?The decision and recommendations shall be based upon the specific factors and criteria set 
forth in the city's ordinances and/or relevant state statutes. 
(3) ?As a part of its decision/recommendation, the commission shall render a written decision and 
statement of facts addressing each of the factors and criteria required by statute or ordinance. 
(4) ?The commission may delay a decision or recommendation until a future meeting to allow the 
members to review and consider the evidence and transcript of the proceedings. 
(H) ?Transcript. 
(1) ?The court reporter shall, at the applicant's cost, transcribe the proceedings and forward one 
copy to the city and one copy to the applicant. The city and applicant may copy the transcripts 
as necessary. Other interested parties may order the transcript from the court reporter at their 
own expense. 
(I) ?Decision by corporate authorities. 
(1) ?For any decision or recommendation requiring action by the corporate authorities (including 
those only requiring action by the city council), the full record of the public hearing, the 
transcript, all evidence and the written decision/recommendation shall be forwarded to the 
council and mayor at least 14 days prior to the action by the corporate authorities (the 14-day 
limit may be waived by the corporate authorities). 
(2) ?In rendering a decision, the corporate authorities shall only consider the record of the public 
hearing and evidence admitted at that hearing, as well as information already in the possession 
of the council (i.e. matters of public record, etc.). The corporate authorities may allow the 
applicant, the city and interested parties to make a statement/argument prior to rendering a 
decision. However, such statement or argument shall be limited to arguing the facts in the 
record, and no new evidence shall be considered. 
(3) ?The corporate authorities may, by a majority vote, refer the matter back to the commission for 
further consideration and the taking of further evidence at another public hearing. 
A. ?Any additional public hearing shall be noticed and published, at the applicant's cost, as the 
initial public hearing. 
(J) ?Retention of records. Upon a final decision by the corporate authorities or the commission, the 
evidence, transcript and findings of fact shall be retained by the city clerk for three years.

Sec. 150.1002. - Goals. 
    The standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this chapter are intended to 
establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial zones, and a 
limited variety of signs in all other zones, subject to the standards and permit procedures of this chapter; 
to allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots 
on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter, but without permits; to 
provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances; to prohibit all signs not expressly permitted or 
provided for by this section; to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this section.

(Ord. No. 801G, § 3, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 113H, § 2, 5-16-11; Ord. No. 341H, § 3, 4-3-17) 


Sec. 150.1004. - Computations. 
    The following principles shall control the computations of sign number, sign area and sign height. 
Figures 150.1004(F)1 and 150.1004(F)2 illustrate the method of computation for various sign types. 
(A) ?Computation of area of individual building signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed by 
means of the smallest rectangle, triangle, circle, or combination thereof that will encompass the 
extreme limits of the writing, emblem, or other representation, together with any material or 
color forming an integral background to the display or used to differentiate the sign from the 
backdrop. Area does not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative wall or fence 
when such wall or fence is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
(B) ?Computation of number and area for freestanding signs. All writing, emblems, decorative 
framework, or other representations mounted on a single sign support structure shall be 
regarded as one sign. All writing, emblems, decorative framework, or other representations 
facing the same direction shall be counted as one sign face. Area of a sign face and total 
freestanding sign area shall be computed by means of the smallest single rectangle that will 
encompass all said elements, including intervening support elements. 
(C) ?Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for signs with surfaces facing more 
than one direction shall be computed by adding the area of all sign faces visible from any one 
point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be 
viewed from any one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same 
structure, and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the 
measurement of one of the faces. 
(D) ?Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base 
of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest component of the sign. Normal grade shall 
be construed as the grade after construction, exclusive of any earth altering activity solely for 
the purpose of locating or elevating the sign. 
(E) ?Computation of maximum total sign area for a zone lot. The permitted number and area of all 
individual signs on a zone lot shall be determined by applying the formulas contained in the 
table 150.1007(B)1. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for 
each frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not 
exceed the portion of the lot's total sign allocation that is derived from the street or wall area 
frontage on that street. 
(F) ?Illustrated computations.

* ?In no case shall the sign height exceed the height of the front wall of the principle building, and in 
no case shall the height of the sign exceed the actual sign setback from any adjacent lot that is 
zoned residential. 
** ?Residential signs in the SR-3, SR-4, and SR-6 districts may either be freestanding or building 
signs-not both, and are limited to one residential sign per lot. Residential signs shall only 
contain a noncommercial messages except advertising for goods or services legally offered on 
the premises where the sign is located, if offering such services at such location conforms with 
all requirements of the zoning ordinance. The use of changeable copy on residential signs is 
prohibited. 
*** ?Setback for freestanding signs is from the sign support. In no case shall any portion of the sign 
project into the right-of-way. See figure 150.1007(C)(1)a, Maximum height and area restrictions. 
**** ?In all non SF districts, lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted signage 
for each street frontage, but signage cannot be accumulated and used on one street in excess 
of that allowed for lots with only one street frontage. Freestanding signs regulated in table 
150.1007(1)A on one frontage must be placed a minimum of 200 feet from nearest same-lot 
freestanding sign on another frontage, measured in a straight line, except in the following 
instances: 
(1) ?A permanent structure obstructs the view of one freestanding sign when viewed from 
another. 
(2) ?The lot fronts on two parallel or nearly parallel streets that do not intersect at a point 
adjacent to the lot. 
Zone lots with two or more establishments where said establishments each have separate 
building entrances are allowed one additional freestanding sign for every 200 feet of street 
frontage, beginning at 400 feet of street frontage. (0-399 feet = maximum of one freestanding 
sign, 400-599 feet of street frontage = maximum of two freestanding signs; 600 799 feet = 3 
signs, etc.) However, in no case shall the number of freestanding signs on one frontage exceed 
the number of establishments located on the zoning lot. Said signs must be spaced a minimum 
of 150 feet apart. 
Developments including shopping centers, industrial parks, and office parks, that include two or 
more establishments, having 400 or more feet per street frontage, and that do not display any 
other freestanding sign used by an individual tenant, may substitute a single sign designating 
the entire development. Such sign may be 25 percent larger in area than the area restrictions 
found in table 150.1007(A)1, but must contain only the name and/or logo of the entire 
development. 
_____ 
(B) ?Building signs. The following restrictions apply to the number, area, height and setback 
requirements for building signs in each district except for building markers, window signs, flags, 
directional signs, incidental signs, identification signs, community signs, temporary signs, and 
other signs exempted per § 150.1005.

Sec. 151.02. - Policy. 
(a) ?It is declared to be the policy of the city to consider the subdivision of land and the subsequent 
development of the subdivided plat as subject to approval by the city for the orderly, planned, 
efficient and economical development of the city. 
(b) ?Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes 
without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other menace; and land shall not be subdivided 
until available public facilities and improvements exist and proper provision has been made for 
drainage, water, sewerage and capital improvements such as schools, parks, recreation facilities, 
transportation facilities, and other related improvements. 
(c) ?It is intended that these regulations shall supplement and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions 
and standards contained in the building codes, zoning ordinance, official zoning map, and land use 
plan of the city. 
(Code 1982, § 151.02; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93)

(1) ?To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city. 
(2) ?To guide the future growth and development of the city. 
(3) ?To provide for safety from fire, flood and other danger, and to prevent overcrowding of the land 
and undue congestion of population. 
(4) ?To protect the character and the social and economic stability of all parts of the city and to 
encourage the orderly and beneficial development of all parts of the city. 
(5) ?To protect and conserve the value of land throughout the city and the value of buildings and 
improvements on the land, and to minimize the conflicts among the uses of land and buildings. 
(6) ?To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate and efficient 
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds, recreation, and other public 
requirements and facilities. 
(7) ?To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and 
resubdivisions, in order to further the orderly layout and use of land; and to ensure proper legal 
descriptions and monumenting of subdivided land. 
(8) ?To ensure that public facilities are available and will have a sufficient capacity to serve the 
proposed subdivision. 
(9) ?To minimize the pollution of air, water and land resources; to assure the adequacy of drainage 
facilities; to safeguard the water table; to control erosion and sedimentation and to encourage 
the wise use and management of natural resources throughout the city in order to preserve the

(Code 1982, § 151.03; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.04. - Jurisdiction. 
(a) ?These subdivision regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land, as defined herein, located 
within the corporate limits of the city or within a distance of 1½ miles from the city's corporate limits. 
However, a division of land, or a combination of land, that meets the requirements of section 1(b) of 
the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/1(b) is not required to comply with the platting requirements of this 
chapter. However, such a division or combination of land may be required to comply with other 
provisions of this chapter 151, including, but not limited to, provisions governing drainage, public 
improvements (if applicable), grading etc. Nothing in this chapter shall excuse failure to comply with 
more stringent requirements that are imposed by another local government unit having jurisdiction 
outside the city limits. 
(b) ?No land shall be considered lawfully subdivided until: 
(1) ?The sub divider obtains preliminary and final approval of the plat itself by the city council; and 
(2) ?The approved plat is filed and recorded with the county clerk. 
(c) ?No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any parcel or plat of land that was 
created by subdivision after May 17, 1993, and not in conformity with the provisions of these 
subdivision regulations; and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private 
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with these regulations. 
(d) ?All properties located within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, as defined by state law, when 
requesting a subdivision plat from the county, or any other affected county, shall be processed by the 
city for compliance with this chapter in the same manner as a subdivision plat within the city. If 
insufficient time exists for such processing, the matter will be placed on the agenda of the next 
regularly scheduled city council meeting for consideration. 
(Code 1982, § 151.04; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 301G, § 2, 8-2-99; Ord. No. 749G, 
§ 1, 8-1-05) 


Sec. 151.05. - Interpretation and conflict. 
(a) ?Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held 
to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b) ?Conflict with public and private provisions. 
(1) ?Public provisions. These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any 
other applicable ordinances, rules or regulations, statutes, or other provisions of law. Where any 
provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other 
provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, or other provision of 
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control. 
(2) ?Private provisions. These regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or 
any other private agreement or restriction; provided that where the provisions of these 
regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, 
covenant, or other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall 
govern. Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or restriction 
impose duties and obligations more restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of 
these regulations, or the conditions imposed by the city in approving a subdivision or in 
enforcing these regulations, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with these 
regulations or determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and 
supplemental to these regulations and determinations made thereunder. 
(Code 1982, § 151.05; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.06. - Resubdivision of land. 
(a) ?If any change in a map of any approved or recorded subdivision plat affects any street layout shown 
on such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan 
legally divided prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be 
subject to same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision. This rule shall be superseded 
where changes meet the exceptions to the Plats Act, 765 ILCS 205/1(b). 
(b) ?Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing 
more than one acre of land and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided 
into small building sites, the city council may require that such parcel of land allow for the future 
opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future 
opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat. 
(Code 1982, § 151.06; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.07. - Vacation of plats. 
(a) ?Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises, at any time before the 
sale of any lot therein, by a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, 
declaring the same to be vacated. 
(b) ?Such an instrument shall be approved by the city council and city attorney in like manner as plats of 
subdivisions. The city council may reject any such instrument that abridges or destroys any public 
rights in any of its public uses, improvements, streets, or alleys. 
(c) ?Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged, or approved and recorded or filed, in like 
manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force 
and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, alleys 
and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described in such plat. 
(d) ?When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided by all the owners 
of lots in such plat joining in the execution of such writing. 
(Code 1982, § 151.07; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.08. - Variances. 
(a) ?Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result 
from strict compliance with these regulations or the purposes of these regulations may be served to 
a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may recommend, to the city council, variances to these 
subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, 
provided that such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these 
regulations; and further provided the commission shall not recommend variances unless it shall 
make findings based on the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(1) ?The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare, or 
injurious to other property as located. 
(2) ?The conditions on which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property for 
which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property. 
(3) ?Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the 
specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from 
a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out. 
(4) ?The variances will not in any manner vary the provisions of the zoning code of the city. 
(b) ?In recommending variances, the commission may recommend such conditions as will, in its 
judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations. 
(c) ?A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the 
preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the commission. The petition shall state fully the 
grounds for the application and all of the facts relied on by the petitioner. 
(Code 1982, § 151.08; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.09. - Enforcement. 
(a) ?It shall be the duty of the public works director and planning director to enforce these regulations 
and to bring to the attention of the city attorney any violations or lack of compliance herewith. 
(b) ?No owner, or agent of the owner, of any parcel of land located in a proposed subdivision shall 
transfer or sell any such parcel before a plat of such subdivision has been approved by the city 
council, in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, and filed with the county clerk. 
(c) ?The subdivision of any lot or any parcel of land, by the use of metes and bounds description for the 
purpose of sale, transfer or lease with the intent of evading these regulations, shall not be permitted. 
All such described subdivisions shall be subject to all of the requirements contained in these 
regulations. 
(d) ?No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure located on a lot or 
plat subdivided or sold in violation of the provisions of these regulations. 
(e) ?Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken by law or in equity to prevent any violation of 
these regulations; to prevent unlawful construction; to recover damages; to restrain, correct, or abate 
a violation; and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises; and these remedies 
shall be in addition to penalties. 
(Code 1982, § 151.09; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.10. - Planned unit developments encouraged. 
    The planned unit development deserves consideration by developers. A properly designed planned 
unit development offers the developer the opportunity to create for the general public housing with greater 
diversity of type and investment, the development of creative and innovated housing types, site design 
and landscaping challenging to the physical site, improved overall use of land, better protection of natural

(Code 1982, § 151.32; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 938F, § 1, 2-21-95) 


ARTICLE III. - IMPROVEMENT, RESERVATION AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 


Sec. 151.40. - General improvements. 
(a) ?Character of the land. Land the city council finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development 
due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, adverse topography, utility easements, or other 
features that will be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present or future 
inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed and 
approved by the city council. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a 
danger. 
(b) ?Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the requirements established herein, 
all subdivision plats shall comply with the following laws, rules and regulations: 
(1) ?All applicable statutory provisions. 
(2) ?The local zoning ordinance, building and housing codes, standards for water and sewer 
construction, and all other applicable local laws of the appropriate jurisdictions. 
(3) ?The official land use plan, official zoning map, including all streets, drainage systems and parks 
shown on the official map or plan as adopted. 
(4) ?The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the health department or 
appropriate state agencies. 
(5) ?The rules of the state highway department where applicable. 
Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with the above guides or policy and 
purposes of the regulations established in section 151.02. 
(c) ?Deed restrictions and covenants. If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the 
subdivision greater than those required by the zoning code or these regulations, such restrictions or 
reference thereto are required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the city council may require 
that restrictive covenants be recorded with the county recorder of deeds in a form that has been 
approved by the city attorney. 
(d) ?Monuments. 
(1) ?References must be made on the plat to known and permanent monuments from which future 
survey may be made; and the surveyor must, at the time of making his survey, set in such 
manner that they will not be moved by frost, good and sufficient monuments marking the 
external boundaries of the tract to be divided or subdivided, and must designate on the plat the 
points where they may be found. 
(2) ?These monuments must be placed at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a 
curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any line and at all angle points along a meander 
line, the points to be not less than 20 feet back from the normal water elevation of a lake or from 
the bank or stream, except that when such corners or points fall within a street, or proposed 
future street, the monuments must be placed in the right-of-way line of the street. All internal 
boundaries, corners and points must be monumented in the field by like monuments as defined 
above. 
(e) ?Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely 
approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. 
The public works department shall have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision, 
which shall be determined at sketch plat approval. 
(f) ?Street names. The preliminary plat as submitted shall indicate proposed street names. Subject to the 
authority of other local government units within the Belvidere fringe area, the city council shall have 
the final decision as to street names. It is intended that street names be sufficiently different in sound 
and spelling from other street names in the city and county so as not to cause confusion. A road that 
is or is planned as a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name. The public works 
department, fire and police departments, and U.S. post office shall be given an opportunity to 
comment on proposed street names. 
(Code 1982, § 151.40; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.41. - Design requirements. 
    No preliminary or final plat shall be approved by the city and no completed improvements shall be 
accepted by the director of public works unless they conform to the following standards and 
specifications: 
(a) ?General. 
(1) ?Conformity with comprehensive plan. The subdivision shall conform to the comprehensive plan 
of the city and the parts thereof. 
(2) ?Provision for future subdivisions. If a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary 
building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets. 
(3) ?Reserve strips prohibited. There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to land dedicated 
or intended to be dedicated public use. 
(b) ?Streets; layouts. 
(1) ?Topography. Streets and thoroughfares shall be appropriately related to the topography of the 
site. Rigid rectangular gridiron patterns need not be used except to extend the existing grid 
system. 
(2) ?Integration with existing streets. Streets shall be integrated with the existing and any proposed 
systems of streets and dedicated rights-of-way. 
(3) ?Minor or local streets. Minor or local streets shall be laid out to discourage use by through 
traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to provide safe and convenient 
access to property. 
(4) ?Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited. Wherever an existing half street is adjacent to a 
tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
(5) ?Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets in excess of 150 feet shall be prohibited except as stubs to 
permit future expansion whereby a temporary cul-de-sac may be required. 
(6) ?Culs-de-sac. In general, culs-de-sac shall not exceed 500 feet in length, and shall have a 
turnaround not less than 80 feet in diameter (110 feet right-of-way) in residential areas, and no 
less than 120 feet in diameter (150 feet right-of-way) in commercial and industrial areas. 
(7) ?Arterial streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, 
the city council may require the following: 
a. ?Marginal-access streets. 
b. ?Nonaccess reserve strips along the rear property line containing screen plantings. 
(8) ?Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on 
arterial and collector streets. The minimum centerline radius of a horizontal curve will be 300 
feet. 
(9) ?Sight distance requirements for horizontal curves. When connecting street lines deflect from 
each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with 
a radius adequate to ensure a minimum sight distance as shown on the table below; however, 
the commission reserves the right to require a greater radius in special cases to ensure safety.

(10) ?Extension. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be 
subdivided unless such extension is deemed to be unnecessary and undesirable for the 
coordination of the subdivision's layout with the existing, natural and manmade adjoining 
environment. 
(11) ?Location. In commercial and industrial developments, the streets shall be planned in 
connection with the building locations, rail facilities, alleys, truck loading and maneuvering 
areas, walks, and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various 
types of traffic including pedestrian. 
(12) ?Street grades. No street grade shall exceed seven percent nor less than 0.4 percent. 
(13) ?Private streets. Private streets may be permitted only when there is sufficient evidence that 
there can be no public interest in such streets. 
(c) ?Street intersections. 
(1) ?Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. Any oblique 
streets should be curved approaching an intersection and should be at right angles for at least 
100 feet therefrom. No more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. 
(2) ?Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, 
coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with 
centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected 
street has separated lanes without median breaks. Intersection of major streets shall be at least 
800 feet apart. 
(3) ?Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot 
corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground 
or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed 
necessary to provide an adequate site distance. 
(4) ?Cross slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be a minimum of two percent and a 
maximum of three percent. 
(d) ?Street classification and widths. 
(1) ?All proposed thoroughfares shall be properly designed to accommodate the type of traffic to be 
generated within and around the proposed subdivision. 
(2) ?The principal street classifications used in this chapter are minor, collector, minor arterial, and 
primary arterial. 
(3) ?The right-of-way and pavement widths shall be as follows: 
a. ?Minor streets shall have a right-of-way of at least 60 feet and a pavement width of at least 
32 feet back-to-back of curb in residential districts, 24 feet with no parking on the street in 
commercial or industrial districts. 
b. ?Collector streets shall have a right-of-way of at least 66 feet and a pavement width of at 
least 35 feet back-to-back of curb. 
c. ?Minor arterial streets shall have a right-of-way of at least 70 feet and a pavement width of 
at least 41 feet back-to-back of curb. 
d. ?Primary arterial streets shall have a right-of-way of at least 80 feet and a pavement width of 
at least 48 feet back-to-back of curb. 
(e) ?Surface improvements. 
(1) ?The paving of streets or alleys shall be a perpetual pavement of a character suitable for the 
traffic expected. Streets shall be constructed with either a minimum of eight inches of plain 
concrete over an approved subsoil base, or 12 inches of aggregate base course over an 
approved subsoil base, or a minimum two inches of hot mix asphalt (HMA) surface course over 
a four-inch HMA binder course over a four-inch HMA base course, on an approved subsoil 
base. Sub soil base shall be either 12 inches of lime modified soil or 12 inches of granular 
subbase. If during construction the sub-soil base does not appear to be suitable for the design 
requirements above, based on inspection by the director of public works or his representative, 
the developer may be required to conduct soil borings every 200 linear feet along the proposed 
street alignment to determine what additional work may be required to create a suitable 
subbase. Such work may involve but not be limited to additional lime stabilization or 
undercutting and removing substandard soils and replacement with an approved aggregation 
subbase. Two-foot mountable combination concrete curbs and gutters shall be provided unless 
integrally provided along with the concrete pavement. All new curb and gutter sections will have 
minimum three-fourths-inch expansion joints every 100 feet and will have sawed contraction 
joints every ten feet. In all cases, the latest edition of state standards for road and bridge 
construction shall be followed. 
(2) ?The subdivider shall install sidewalks four feet in width and otherwise meeting the standards of 
sidewalks approved by the city council. No sidewalk shall be constructed adjacent to the curb 
except in commercial and industrial zoning districts. Sidewalks shall be constructed within the 
public right-of-way and within six inches of the right-of-way line. 
(f) ?Lots and blocks; layout. 
(1) ?Lot and block arrangement shall take into consideration manmade and natural features and 
conform to accepted standards of subdivision design. 
(2) ?Lot dimensions shall comply with the requirements of the city zoning code (for property located 
within the city limits) or the county zoning ordinance (for property located outside city limits). 
(3) ?Each lot shall have frontage on a street for at least 40 feet. 
(4) ?Corner lots for residential use shall provide extra width to permit appropriate building setback 
from and orientation to both streets. 
(5) ?Generally, all side lot lines should be as near as possible to right angles to street lines and 
radial to curved street lines except when the commission determines that a variation to this rule 
would provide for a better layout. 
(6) ?Double-frontage and reversed-frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to 
provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific 
disadvantages of topography. Development of these lots may occur by either the use of 
frontage roads or backing lots to the actual street with landscaping and screening along the rear 
property line. These methods are recommended for the purpose of provided adequate 
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. If 
landscaping and screening along the rear property lien is decided upon then said landscaping 
and or screening shall be placed within an outlot and not upon individual lots within the 
subdivision. 
(7) ?Block length shall not be greater than 1,000 feet in length unless the blocks are fixed as a 
result of existing conditions, nor less than 400 feet in length. Blocks over 800 feet in length may 
require pedestrian ways at their approximate centers or where deemed necessary by the city 
council. 
(8) ?Block width, except where its width is determined by the projection of an existing block, shall be 
not less than 240 feet and not greater than 1,000 feet. 
(g) ?Road dedication and reservations. 
(1) ?Where a subdivision borders an existing road that does not currently meet the subdivision 
control standards or when the master plan, official map, or zoning setback regulations indicate 
plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of some of the land in the 
subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas 
for widening or realignment of such roads. Such roads and streets shall be improved and 
dedicated by the subdivider at his own expense to the full width as required by these 
subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying 
yard or area requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
(2) ?Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited-access 
thoroughfare right-of-way, the city council may require a street approximately parallel to and on 
each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of intervening land 
as for peak purposes, deep residential lots backing to railroad or thoroughfares with planting 
screens in a no-access at rear property lines of lots, or motor vehicle parking, business or 
industry in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined with due regard for the 
requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(h) ?Solar provisions. To maximize potential for unobstructed solar access to all lots or parcels, streets 
providing direct access to abutting lots shall be laid out to run in a generally east-west direction to the 
maximum extent feasible, within the limitations of existing topography, the configuration of the site, 
predesignated future street locations, existing street patterns of adjacent development, and the 
preservation of significant natural features. 
(i) ?Street signs and lighting. The subdivider is responsible for all the costs of furnishing and installing all 
streetlights and signs needed as a result of the subdivision. Such improvements shall be made in 
accordance with the requirements of the department of public works and shall be included in the 
completion of the total amount of land posted. 
(Code 1982, § 151.41; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 1H, § 1, 1-5-09) 


Sec. 151.42. - Drainage, storm sewers and detention areas. 
(a) ?Topography and profile studies. Street plan, profile and cross section plans for all streets in the 
subdivision shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer in accordance with requirements 
of the subdivision's control design requirements and the department of public works. The engineer, 
as agent for the subdivider or his contractor, shall be responsible for establishing the proper lines 
and grades for all earth work and drainage according to the grading plan for the entire plat. 
(b) ?Lot drainage replaced by grading plan/lot drainage. 
(1) ?All subdivisions shall have a site grading plan at the same scale as the sketch plan with 
existing and proposed contours shown at a maximum interval of two feet, referenced to sea 
level datum, prepared by a registered professional engineer, submitted with the construction 
plans. The site grading plan shall give the following information: 
a. ?Directional arrows shall be shown for all storm drainage easements indicating the 
stormwater flow to drainage structures. 
b. ?Finished elevation at street centerlines every 50 feet. 
c. ?Location of all proposed underground storm drains, manholes, and inlets to be built as part 
of the subdivision. 
d. ?Detail of typical lot drainage. 
e. ?Finished elevation at every lot corner. 
(2) ?In general, lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and 
individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. 
(3) ?Where topography or other conditions make it impractical to include drainage facilities within 
the right-of-way, storm drains and type A inlets will be constructed in easements at a maximum 
of 500 feet spacing intervals to serve such drainage ways. Drainage work shall be completed 
before the placement of any surfacing material. 
(c) ?Drainage easements. 
(1) ?Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, there 
shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to 
the lines of such watercourse and including the required vegetative buffers; such easement 
shall be wide enough to accommodate the runoff from the 100-year storm event. Detailed 
engineering calculations shall be provided to the satisfaction of the department of public works 
to verify the design. 
(2) ?Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of 
drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet 
in width for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines and 
with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat. 
(d) ?Regulating stormwater detention basins and development for floodplains and detention/retention 
areas. This subsection is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the city by the Illinois 
Compiled Statutes (chapter 65, section 11-12-6). 
(1) ?Purpose; objectives. The purpose of this subsection is to diminish threats to public health, 
safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and 
redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable 
properties, the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of 
valuable stream and lake resources. The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and 
rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this 
subsection regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts. 
This subsection is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
a. ?To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to 
others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
b. ?To protect new buildings and major improvements to building from flood damage due to 
increased flooding on a watershed basis; 
c. ?To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed 
basis; 
d. ?To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged 
public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and 
relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development; 
e. ?To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
f. ?To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and flood plains 
and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats; 
g. ?To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and 
stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian 
habitats, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance 
community and economic development.

plain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by the DWR, which is needed to store 
and convey the existing and anticipated future 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more 
than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more 
than a ten percent increase in velocities. The regulatory flood ways are designated for the 
Kishwaukee River and identified tributary on the flood boundary and floodway map prepared by 
FEMA and dated 1982 as subsequently amended. The regulatory floodways or those parts of 
unincorporated Boone County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city that may 
be annexed into the city are designated for the Kishwaukee River and identified tributary on the 
Flood Boundary and floodway map prepared by the FEMA and dated 1982 as subsequently 
amended. To locate the regulatory floodway boundary on any site, the regulatory floodway 
boundary should scaled off the regulatory floodway map and located on a site plan, using

shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage systems to reduce the volume of 
stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. 
The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered 
compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, 
recreation (boating, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant 
should avoid using portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management. 
(7) ?Design criteria, standards, and methods. 
a. ?Release rates: The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the peak 
rate of discharge from the property for the two-year, 24-hour and 100-year, 24-hour events 
to levels which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream 
when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and down stream drainage 
capacities. The peak discharge form events less than or equal to the two-year event shall 
not be greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge 
shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property drained. 
b. ?Detention basin outlet design: Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream 
drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet. 
c. ?Detention storage requirements: the design maximum storage to be provided in a detention 
basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour event and reservoir (also 
called modified plus or level pool) routing or equal. Detention storage shall be computed 
using hydrograph methods as described in this section. 
d. ?Drainage system design and evaluation: The following criteria should be used in evaluating 
and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity to pass 
the 10-year peak flow in the minor drainage system and an overload flow path for flows in 
excess of the design capacity. 
e. ?Design methodologies: Major and minor conveyance systems for areas up to 20 acres may 
be designed using the rational formula. The rational formula may also be used in sizing the 
minor drainage system for sites up to 50 acres. Runoff hydrograph methods as described 
in subsection (7)g. must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with 
greater than 20 acres of drainage area and for the design of all detention basins. 
f. ?Positive drainage: Whenever practicable, all areas of the property must be provided an 
overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a stage at least one foot below the 
lowest foundations grade in the vicinity of the flow path. Minimum slope of the overland 
flow path shall be 0.5 percent. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of 
the minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding 
and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch. 
g. ?Methods for Generating Runoff Hydrographs: Runoff hydrographs using TR-55 for sites up 
to 100 acres shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall 
amounts and antecedent moisture. 
h. ?Rainfall: Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system hydrology is used, 
all design rainfall events shall be based on the larger of Illinois State Water Survey's 
Bulletin 70 or that shown on local Isohyetal maps. The first cartel point rainfall distribution 
shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with critical durations 
less than or equal to 12 hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for 
the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance systems with critical durations 
greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. The fourth quartile distribution shall be 
used in the design and analysis of systems with durations greater than 24 hours. The first, 
third, and fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in table 37 of Bulletin 
70. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff distributions. 
i. ?Antecedent moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not rely on a 
continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume a conservative wet 
antecedent moisture condition as a minimum. For SCS TR-20 and TR-55 use condition 
two. 
j. ?Wet detention basin design: Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater 
pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available 
for recreational use. 
k. ?Wet basin depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep, excluding nearshore banks 
and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at least ten feet deep over 
25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out. 
l. ?Wet basin shoreline slopes: The side of slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation 
shall not be steeper than five to one (horizontal to vertical). 
m. ?Permanent pool volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall 
be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two-year event. 
n. ?Inlet and outlet orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets 
and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
o. ?Dry detention basin design: In addition to the other requirements of this subsection, dry 
basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically 
pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses. The minimum bottom 
slope shall be 0.5 percent. 
p. ?Dry basin drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that 80 percent of their bottom area 
shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100-
year event. Underdrains directed to the outlet control shall be used if necessary to 
accomplish this requirement. 
q. ?Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin 
designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of 
pollutants. 
r. ?Inlet and outlet orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and 
outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
s. ?Minimum detention outlet size: Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to 
control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of four inches. If this minimum orifice 
size permits release rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional 
detention is not a practical alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which 
incorporate self cleaning flow restrictors. 
t. ?Detention in flooplains, flood fringe areas, floodways and on-stream detention: Stormwater 
detention is prohibited in these areas. 
u. ?Drainage into wetlands: Wetlands shall be protected from damaging modifications and 
adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In 
addition to the other requirements of this subsection, the following requirements shall be 
met for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands; 
v. ?Detention in wetlands: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of 
stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality 
and the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform 
beneficial functions. Existing depression storage in wetlands shall be maintained and the 
volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of the section shall be in 
addition to this existing storage. 
w. ?Sediment control: The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by 
appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and shall not be filled. 
x—z. ?Reserved. 
aa. ?Alteration of drainage patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially 
decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland. 
bb. ?Detention/sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be routed through a 
preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year, 24-hour event 
and hold for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be 
constructed before property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in 
section (5) should by followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to 
the wetland. 
cc. ?Vegetated buffer strip: A buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width, preferably vegetated with 
native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland. 
dd. ?Street, parking lot, and culvert drainage: 
ee. ?Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major drainage system, ponding 
depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch and shall not remain flooded 
for more than eight hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year event. 
ff. ?Parking lots: The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking area shall not exceed 
six inches for more than four hours. 
gg. ?Culvert road and driveway crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider entrance 
and exit losses as well as tail water conditions on the culvert. 
hh. ?Infiltration practices: To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices including 
basins, trenches, and porous pavement should be located on soils in hydrologic soil groups 
"A" or "B" as designated by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Infiltration basins and 
trenches designed to recharge groundwater shall not be located within 75 feet of a water 
supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove 
coarse sediment form stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. 
Storm water shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over eighty percent of a dry 
basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of 
infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet above seasonally high groundwater and 
bedrock. 
ii. ?Safety considerations: The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, 
shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the 
system during runoff events. 
jj. ?Side slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at one-hundred year capacity shall be 
as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of 
maintenance. Side slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than 
three to one (horizontal to vertical) except in residential developments where they shall not 
exceed 4 to 1. 
kk. ?Safety ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least four feet in 
width, two and one-half to three feet below the normal water depth. 
ll. ?Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be controlled to safe 
levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow in residential developments 
velocities shall not exceed a factor of four (product of velocity in ft./sec. times depth in 
feet). 
mm. ?Overflow structures: All stormwater detention basins shall be provided with an overflow 
structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at least one foot below the 
lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the 
overflow structure shall be equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate. 
nn. ?Maintenance considerations: The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to 
minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed sideslopes shall be designed to allow 
lawnmowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be provided with 
alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool for sediment removal. 
(Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not feasible.) Pre-sedimentation 
basins shall be included, where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. 
Access for heavy equipment shall be provided. 
(8) ?Accommodating flows from upstream tributary areas. Storm water runoff from areas tributary to 
the property shall be considered in the design of the properties drainage system. Whenever 
practical, flows from upstream areas that are not to be detained should be routed around the 
basin being provided for the site being developed. 
a. ?Upstream areas not meeting ordinance requirements: When there are areas not meeting 
the storage and release rates of this subsection tributary to the applicant's property, 
regionalized detention on the applicants property shall be explored by the applicant. The 
following steps shall be followed: 
1. ?The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his property using the 
release rates of subsection (6), the applicant's property are, and the procedures 
described in subsection (7). 
2. ?Areas tributary to the applicant's property not meeting the storage and release rate 
requirements of this subsection, shall be identified. 
3. ?Using the areas determined in (8)a.2. above plus the applicant's property area, total 
storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed. 
Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined property areas. Storage 
shall be computed as described in subsection (7). If tributary areas are not developed, a 
reasonable fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the 
purposes of computing storage. 
Once the necessary combined storage is computed the city may choose to pay for over 
sizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's 
responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as computed in "1." above. If 
regional storage is selected by the city then the design produced in "2." above shall be 
implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the city, the applicant shall bypass all 
tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever practicable. If the applicant 
must route upstream flows through his basin and the upstream areas exceed one-square 
mile in size, the applicant must meet the provisions of section (7)w. for on-stream basins. 
b. ?Upstream areas meeting ordinance requirements: When there are areas which meet the 
storage and release rate requirements of this subsection, tributary to the applicant's 
property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the applicant's detention basin, or 
be routed though the applicant's detention basin if this is the only practical alternative. 
Storage needed for the applicant's property shall still be computed as described in 
subsection (8)a.1. However, if the city decides to route tributary area flows through an 
applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases shall be based on the combined 
total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas. It must be shown that at no time will 
the runoff rate from the applicant's property exceed the allowable release rate for his/her 
property alone. 
(9) ?Early completion of detention facilities. Where detention, retention, or depressional storage 
areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as 
the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these 
facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in order to maintain the 
design volume of the facilities. 
(10) ?Fee in lieu of detention. The city shall have the option of requiring a fee as determined by the 
director of public works at the time of platting for each acre-foot of detention needed in lieu of 
the applicant building a basin on-site provided the property will discharge stormwater to the 
city's storm sewer system. 
(11) ?Maintenance responsibility. Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities located on private 
property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before final plat approval or 
before issuance of a building permit is obtained from the city the applicant shall execute a 
maintenance agreement with the city guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of 
the property will maintain its stormwater drainage system. Such agreement shall be recorded 
with the county recorder of deeds. The maintenance agreement shall include a schedule for 
regular maintenance of each aspect of the property's stormwater drainage system and shall 
provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized personnel of the city. The 
maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the department of public works notifies the 
property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner 
shall make such corrections within 30 calender days of such notification. If the corrections are 
not made within this time period the city may have the necessary work completed and assess 
the cost to the property owner. 
The city has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner for maintenance of 
the stormwater drainage system. 
(12) ?Administration. 
a. ?Inspections. 
b. ?Inspections during construction. General site grading shall not begin until the director of 
public works has certified in writing to the applicant that any necessary detention facilities 
are in place and operational. The director of public works or his representative will also 
conduct periodic inspections of the work in progress to be certain that the drainage system 
is being built as designed. If any violations of the provisions or requirements of this 
subsection are noted during such inspections, the department of public works shall notify 
the property owner in writing of the items needing correction. The property owner shall 
have ten calendar days to make such corrections unless given a specific extension of time 
in writing by the department of public works. 
Failure to complete such corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a 
violation of this subsection. 
c. ?Final inspection. Upon notification by the applicant that the drainage system is completed, 
the director of public works or his representative shall conduct a final inspection. Upon 
finding that the drainage system meets the provisions of requirements of this subsection, 
the director of public works shall issue in writing a notice that the drainage system is 
completed. If the drainage system is not in compliance with section 151.45(2) or is found to 
contain deficiencies which require correction, the director of public works or his 
representative shall notify the property owner of the necessary corrections. The property 
owner shall correct such deficiencies within ten calender days unless given a specific 
extension of time in writing by the director of public works. Failure to make necessary 
corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of this subsection. 
d. ?Routing inspections. All privately owned drainage systems may be inspected by 
representative of the city not less often than once per year. A written report shall be filed of 
the results of any inspection and a copy sent to the property owner detailing any problems 
which need correction. 
e. ?Enforcement. The administration and enforcement of this subsection shall be the 
responsibility of the director of public works of the city or his representatives. 
f. ?Appeals. All appeals to the director of public works' decisions regarding the interpretation of 
this subsection shall be heard by the city council. 
(e) ?Storm sewers. All storm sewers shall be designed to handle a ten-year storm event as determined 
by state design standards shall be constructed to provide proper drainage for the subdivided area 
and for any adjacent areas that can drain into the same storm sewers. The drainage plan for each 
site or development shall also include both a minor system (underground storm sewer/ten-year 
event) and a major system (excess overland flow) for storm events exceeding the capacity of the 
underground storm sewer system; both systems shall be shown on the plans and covered by 
permanent drainage easements if not within the public right-of-way. All necessary design details 
shall be submitted to the department of public works for approval prior to construction or prior to final 
plat approval by the city council. 
(f) ?Subsurface drainage. Vacant parcels of land of five acres or more subject to annexation shall 
comply with the following: 
(1) ?Prior to submittal of a preliminary plat of development, the developer shall retain the services of 
a qualified subsurface drainage consultant. The consultant shall locate all existing farm and 
storm drainage tiles by means of slit trenching and hand probing by persons qualified to do such 
work. 
All existing drain tile lines encountered during the investigation shall be repaired to their original 
condition unless the tile line is to be abandoned, replaced or rerouted. 
(2) ?The developer shall provide two mylar and four copies of a topographical boundary map 
locating these lines, showing: 
a. ?Location of each slit trench and identified to correspond with the tile investigation report 
and field staked at no less than 50-foot intervals; 
b. ?Location of each drain tile with a flow direction arrow and tile size; 
c. ?A summary of the tile investigation report showing trench identification number, tile size, 
material and quality, percentage of the tile filled with water, percentage of restrictions 
caused by silting, depth of ground cover, and soil texture at grade; 
d. ?Name, address and phone number of person or firm conducting the tile location 
investigation. 
(3) ?Shall take steps to preserve or protect the capacity and function of any existing subsurface 
drainage system as follows: 
a. ?Information collected during the drainage investigation shall be used to design and develop 
a new subsurface drainage system that will provide drainage for the newly created 
development. This new system shall not disrupt or alter the functional capacity of any 
existing or connected tile system. 
b. ?The new subsurface drainage system shall be included as part of the preliminary platting 
process. Existing and new drain tile lines shall be shown on a mylar overlay and will be 
submitted at the same time as the preliminary plat for review by the appropriate agencies. 
(4) ?Shall not drain, fill or destroy any wetlands located on the parcel in question. 
a. ?The developer will refer to the Natural Resource Information Report (NRI) completed by the 
county soil and water conservation district to determine if wetlands were indicated on the 
parcel. The BCSWCD uses USFWS wetlands inventory maps, SCS wetland determination 
maps, and other references to determine if wetlands are likely to exist on any given parcel. 
b. ?Adverse effects can include: 
1. ?Increased erosion. 
2. ?Reduced water quality (higher quantities of total suspended solids). 
3. ?Increased flooding (frequency and duration). 
4. ?Siltation or sedimentation. 
5. ?Destruction of buildings, structures or wildlife habitats.

Department will be BBD; and the Boone County Soil and Water Conservation District will be BCSWCD. 
    Handbooks adopted by reference. The standards and specifications contained in the latest editions 
of the "Illinois Urban Manual - A Technical Manual for Urban Ecosystem Protection and Enhancement" 
and the "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control," commonly known 
as the green book, are hereby incorporated into this section and made a part hereof by reference for the 
purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation under site development and erosion and 
sediment control plans. 
(a) ?Objective. It is the objective of this section to control soil erosion and sediment caused by 
development activities, including clearing, grading, striping, excavating, and filling of land in the city. 
Measures taken to control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff shall be adequate to assure that 
sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year frequency or less. The 
following principles shall apply to all regulated development activities within the city and to the 
preparation of the submissions required of this section: 
(1) ?Plan the development to fit the particular topography, soils, drainage patterns, and natural 
vegetation of the site. 
(2) ?Preserve and protect areas of natural vegetation on the site. 
(3) ?Take special precautions to prevent damages which could result from development activity 
adjacent to watercourses, lakes, and wetlands. 
(4) ?Minimize the extent and duration of the area exposed at one time. 
(5) ?Apply temporary erosion control practices as soon as possible to stabilize exposed soils and 
prevent on-site damage. 
(6) ?Install sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and perimeter control prior to site 
clearing and grading to protect disturbed areas from off-site and on-site runoff, and to prevent 
sediment damage to areas located downslope of the development site. 
(7) ?Keep runoff velocities low and provide for retention of runoff on the site. 
(8) ?Provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. 
(9) ?Implement final grading and install permanent vegetation on disturbed areas as soon as 
possible. 
(10) ?Implement through inspection, maintenance and follow-up program. 
(b) ?Site development. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall commence or 
perform any clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, or filling of land which meets the following 
provisions without having first obtaining approval for a complete set of construction plans, including a 
detailed erosion and sediment control plan from the BDPW and BCSWCD. 
(1) ?Any land disturbing activity (i.e. clearing, grading, stripping, excavation, fill or any combination 
thereof) that will affect an area in excess of one acre. 
(2) ?Any land disturbing activity that will affect an area in excess of 500 square feet if the activity is 
within 100 feet of a lake, pond, stream, or wetland; or 
(3) ?Excavation, fill, or any combination thereof that will exceed 100 cubic yards. 
(4) ?The BPWD and/or the BBD, in consultation with the BCSWCD, reserves the right to require 
any non-agricultural, construction development activity, regardless of disturbed area or type of 
activity, to comply with this section if it is determined to be the cause of or a contributor to an 
existing or potential erosion, sediment, or stormwater impact.

(3) ?Site design requirements. Practice standards and specifications for measures outlined in the 
soil erosion and sediment control plan shall follow criteria in the latest edition of the "Illinois 
Urban Manual: A Technical Manual Designed for Urban Ecosystem Protection and 
Enhancement", which is hereby incorporated into this section by reference. 
The BDPW, in consultation with the BCSWCD, may waive specific requirements upon finding 
that the objectives and principles of this section have been met. 
Onsite sediment control measures, as specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed 
and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the 
site. 
a. ?For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers (including filter fences (heavy 
duty fabric only) or equivalent control measures shall be constructed to control all offsite 
runoff as specified in the referenced handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum 
width of 35 feet, may be used as an alternative only where runoff is expected to be sheet 
flow (vegetated filter strips must be established prior to land disturbing activities). 
b. ?Filter barriers are appropriate sediment control measures for small drainage areas where 
concentrated flow is not present or expected. 
c. ?For disturbed areas draining more than one but less than five acres, a sediment trap or 
equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point(s) of the disturbed 
area(s). Sediment barriers such as silt fences are ineffective an unreliable in such 
situations. In particular, they are subject to undercutting and blowout due to high water 
velocities. 
d. ?For disturbed areas draining more than five acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control 
measure shall be constructed at the downslope point(s) of the disturbed area(s). 
e. ?Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for both detention storage and 
sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed of equal volumes of "wet" 
detention storage and "dry" detention storage and each shall be sized for 25-year, 24-hour 
runoff from the site under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate 
of the basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten 
hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry 
detention storage. 
f. ?The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from 
the site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to 
the volume of sediment generated in one year. For construction periods exceeding one 
year, the one-year sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted. 
(4) ?Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and diversions, and the outlets of 
all channels and pipes shall be designed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the 100-
year frequency storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized 
within 48 hours, consistent with the following standards: 
a. ?For grades up to four percent, seeding in combination with mulch, erosion blanket, or an 
equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied 
to the bottom of the channel. 
b. ?For grades of four to eight percent, sod or an equivalent control measure shall be applied 
in the channel. 
c. ?For grades greater than eight percent, rock, riprap, or an equivalent control measure shall 
be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures. 
(5) ?Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within ten days 
following the end of active disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria: 
a. ?Temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching, sodding, 
and/or non-vegetative measures. 
b. ?Areas having slopes greater than 12 percent shall be stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in 
combination with seeding. The use of any stabilization mat, blanket, or sod shall require 
the implementation of approved standards and specifications for installation procedures. 
c. ?Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed in the dry 
and be fully stabilized before flow is diverted. 
(6) ?Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting 
accepted design standards and specifications. 
(7) ?Soil storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material shall not be located with a 
downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter 
barriers, including silt fence, or equivalent, shall be installed immediately around the perimeter 
of the soil storage pile(s). 
(8) ?If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All 
pumped discharges including discharge water from basement sump pumps, shall be routed 
through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins or equivalent. 
(9) ?Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives, and parking areas 
of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private 
roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private roadway shall be removed by shoveling or 
street cleaning (not flushing with water) before the end of each workday and transported to a 
controlled sediment disposal area. 
(10) ?All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices shall be maintained and 
repaired as needed to assure effective performance of their intended function. 
(11) ?All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within 30 days of 
final site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment 
and other disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be 
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. 
(g) ?Maintenance of control measures. All soil erosion and sediment control measures installed to meet 
the requirements of this section shall be maintained by the applicant or subsequent land owner 
during the period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure 
adequate performance. The applicant or the contractor responsible for maintaining the erosion and 
sediment control practices shall inspect all such practices at least once every seven days or 
immediately following a precipitation event equal to or exceeding ½ inch of rainfall in a 24-hour 
period of time. 
(h) ?Inspections. The BCSWCD shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve 
that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with 
the site development or erosion and sediment control plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping, 
excavating, and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the city and BCSWCD shall be 
maintained at the site during progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections and to ensure 
compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, the grading or building permit, and 
this section, the permittee shall notify the city and the BCSWCD within two (2) working days of the 
completion of the construction stages specified below: 
(1) ?Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control measures (including perimeter 
controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any other earth disturbance or grading; 
(2) ?After stripping and clearing; 
(3) ?After rough grading; 
(4) ?After final grading; 
(5) ?After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and 
(6) ?After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to the removal of temporary sediment controls. 
If stripping, clearing, grading, and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the permittee shall 
give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or 
area. If an inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five working days after notice 
is received by the city from the permittee, the permittee may continue work at his/her own risk, without 
presuming acceptance by the city. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing at 
the site. A duplicate copy shall be kept by the enforcing agency and/or the BCSWCD. 
(i) ?Special precautions. 
(1) ?If at any stage of the grading of any development site the city determines by inspection that the 
nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any 
property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the city may require, as a 
condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions to be taken 
as are considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may 
include, but are not limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage 
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion 
control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer, certified professional erosion and 
sediment control specialist, or licensed professional geologist which may be made requirements 
for further work. 
(2) ?Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on any development site 
is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures 
or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public 
safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the city may specify the 
time of starting grading or completion of, or may require that the operations be conducted in 
specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent 
of seasonal rains. 
(j) ?Amendments of plans. Major amendments of the site development or erosion and sediment control 
plans shall be submitted to the BDPW and BCSWCD and shall be processed and approved or 
disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be 
authorized by the BCSWCD by written authorization to the permittee. 
(k) ?Enforcement. 
(1) ?Stop-work order. In the event any person holding an approved erosion and sediment control 
plan pursuant to this section violates the terms of such approval, or carries on site development 
in such a manner as to materially, adversely affect health, welfare, or safety of persons residing 
or working in the neighborhood of the development site or so as to be materially detrimental to 
the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the BPWD or 
BBD may suspend or revoke approved construction activity including, but not limited to: building 
permits, grading activity, road construction, or other construction related activities until such 
time that the approved erosion and sediment control plan is satisfactorily implemented and/or 
maintained. 
(2) ?Enforcement of violations of an approved plan shall be by a written stop-work order issued by 
the BDPW or the BBD and delivered to the permittee or his/her agent or the person performing 
the work. The stop-work order shall be effective immediately, shall state the specific violations 
cited, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Failure to follow an 
approved erosion and sediment control plan may be just cause to permanently suspend or 
revoked authorized construction activity or building permit until a hearing is held by the city's 
public works committee. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee, either 
personally or by registered mail at least five days prior to the date set for the hearing, and shall 
state: 
a. ?The grounds for complaint or reasons for suspension or revocation, in clear and concise 
language; and 
b. ?The time when and place where such hearing will be held. 
At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to be heard and may call witnesses 
and present evidence on his or her behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing the public works 
committee shall determine whether the approved plan shall be suspended or revoked. 
(3) ?Violations and penalties. No person shall construct, enlarge, alter, repair, or maintain any 
grading, excavation or fill, or cause the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any terms 
of this section. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty 
of a misdemeanor, and each day during which any violation of any of the provisions of this 
section is committed, continued, or permitted shall constitute a separate offense. Upon any 
such violation, such person, partnership, corporation or other entity shall be punished by a fine 
of not less than $250.00 for each offense. Each day that a violation continues will be deemed a 
separate offense. In addition to any other penalty authorized by this section, any person, 
partnership, corporation or other entity convicted of violating any of the provisions of this section 
shall be required to restore the site to the condition existing prior to the commission of the 
violation, or to bear the expense of such restoration.

(Code 1982, § 151.46; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 240G, §§ 1, 2, 8-3-98; Ord. No. 
702G, § 1, 3-21-05; Ord. No. 1H, § 1, 1-5-09) 


Sec. 151.47. - Sewerage facilities. 
(a) ?General requirements. 
(1) ?All new subdivisions within 1,500 feet of the city sewer system shall be connected to the city 
sanitary sewerage system unless located in the Belvidere fringe area and exempted as 
described in subsection (b) below. 
(2) ?Sewerage system extensions and connections shall be approved by the department of public 
works. No roadway crossings shall be considered a barrier to sewer system extensions. 
(3) ?The location of all sanitary sewerage systems improvements shall be indicated on the 
preliminary plat, and the cost of installing same shall be included in the performance bond to be 
furnished by the subdivider. 
(4) ?All sanitary sewerage services to individual lots shall be located by imprinting the letter "S" 
three inches high in the face of all new curbs and gutters. 
(b) ?Fringe area status. Sanitary sewerage systems shall be constructed as follows: 
(1) ?Where the city sewerage system is within 1,500 feet of the nearest point of a property line, and 
the existing sewer system is capable at accepting the additional loading of the proposed 
development. The subdivider shall connect with same and provide sewers to each lot in the 
subdivision. 
(2) ?Where the city sewerage system is not so located but is projected to be so located within ten 
years, the subdivider may choose to: 
a. ?Build a central sewage system, the maintenance cost to be assessed against each 
property benefited. 
b. ?Install individual private disposal systems, provided the applicant installs, at the same time, 
sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in the subdivision 
boundary where a future connection with the public sewer shall be made. Sewer lines shall 
be laid from the house to the street line, and a connection shall be available in the home to 
connect from the individual disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers 
become available. Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready for use and shall 
conform to all plans for installation of the public sewer system where such exist, and shall 
be ready for connection to such public sewer main. 
(3) ?Where the city sewerage system is not reasonably accessible and not projected to be available 
within ten years, the subdivider may utilize either a private central sewage system or individual 
disposal systems, subject to approval of the city council and the county health officer, provided 
the plat shall have sufficient easement provisions for future utility lines. 
(c) ?Mandatory connection to a public sewer system. If the property owner is required to connect to the 
sewer for the purpose of disposing of waste, it shall be unlawful for any such owner or occupant to 
maintain upon any such property an individual sewage disposal system. 
(d) ?Use of individual systems. If individual sewage disposal systems are allowed, the lot areas shall 
conform to the requirements of the county zoning ordinance and system design specifics shall 
conform to the county sewage disposal code. 
(e) ?Design criteria for sanitary sewers. These design criteria are not intended to cover extraordinary 
situations. Deviations will be allowed and may be required in those instances where considered 
justified by the director of public works. 
(1) ?Design factors. 
a. ?Sanitary sewer systems shall be designed for the ultimate tributary population. Sewer 
capacities shall be adequate to handle the anticipated maximum hourly quantity of 
sewerage and industrial waste together with an adequate allowance for infiltration and 
other extraneous flow. The unit design flows presented hereinafter shall be adequate in 
each case for the particular type of development indicated. Sewers shall be designed for 
the total tributary area using the following criteria: One- and two-family dwellings, 0.02 
cubic feet per second (c.f.s.)/acre.

b. ?These design factors shall apply to watersheds of 300 acres and smaller than 1,000 acres 
and shall be computed on the basis of a linear decrease from the applicable design factor 
for an area of 300 acres to a design factor of 0.01 c.f.s./acre for an area of 1,000 acres 
unless otherwise directed by the department of public works. Design factors for watersheds 
larger than 1,000 acres shall be 0.01 c.f.s./acre. 
(2) ?Maximum size. The diameter of sewers proposed shall not exceed the diameter of the existing 
or proposed outlet whichever is applicable, unless otherwise approved by the department of 
public works. 
(3) ?Minimum size. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. 
(4) ?Minimum slope. All sewers shall be designed to give mean velocities when flowing full of not 
less than 2.7 feet per second. All velocity and flow calculations shall be based on the Manning 
formula using an N value of 0.013. Serving less than 30 houses, sewers shall have a minimum 
slope of 0.76 percent. Serving less than ten houses, sewers shall have a minimum slope of one 
percent (see table 1).

*Any deviation shall be approved by director of public works 
(5) ?Alignment. All sewers shall be laid with straight alignment between manholes. 
(6) ?Manhole location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; at all changes in grade, 
size or alignment; at all intersections; and at distances not greater than 400 feet for sewers 15 
inches and smaller, and 500 feet for sewers 18 inches in diameter and larger. 
(7) ?Manholes. The difference in elevation between any incoming sewer and the manhole invert 
shall not exceed 12 inches except where required to match crowns. Inside drop manholes will 
require special considerations. When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the crown of the 
smaller sewer shall not be lower than that of the larger one. The minimum drop through 
manholes shall be 0.02 feet. 
(8) ?Sewage locations. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless 
topography dictates otherwise. When located in easements on private property, access shall be 
provided by dedication of right-of-way from the public street or alley to the easement. No less 
than six feet of cover shall be provided over the top of pipe in street and alley rights-of-way or 
three feet in all other areas. 
(9) ?Cleanouts. Cleanouts are required for all services and shall be installed in accordance with city 
standards. 
(10) ?Water supply interconnections. There shall be no physical connection between a public or 
private potable water supply system and a sewer which will permit the passage of any sewage 
or polluted water into the potable supply. Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells 
or other water supply sources and structures. 
(11) ?Relationship of sewers to water mains. The relationship (location) of sanitary sewers to water 
mains shall be in accordance with section 212F, Distribution Division of Public Water Supplies 
Technical Policy Statements, latest revised edition. 
(12) ?Services. Any sewer service below the rim elevation of the nearest downstream manhole 
within 1,500 lineal feet of a sanitary pump station shall be lifted and discharged by automatic 
pumping equipment into the sewer collection system. All services shall be equipped with a 
suitable backwater valve in accordance with the city standards to inhibit service backup during 
high flow conditions. 
(Code 1982, § 151.47; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 1H, § 1, 1-5-09) 


Sec. 151.48. - Public uses. 
(a) ?Compliance with local plans. All subdivision plats shall comply with the official land use plan and 
any additional adopted plans such as the city comprehensive plan, official map, public utilities plan, 
annexation policies, capital improvements program, well head protection program, and any other 
such relevant plans. 
(b) ?Reservation of land for public use. 
(1) ?The city council may require that land be reserved on a plat for a specific public use for future 
acquisition by the city or other public agency when a need for such use is evident in the vicinity 
of the proposed subdivision. 
(2) ?The acquisition of land reserved by a public agency on the final plat shall be initiated within 12 
months of the final plat approval for that portion of the plat containing the reserved land. Failure 
on the part of the public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed time shall result in 
the removal of the reserved designation from the property involved and the freeing of the 
property for development in accordance with this chapter. This section does not refer to 
dedications that may be required by the city council for specific reasonable improvements. 
(Code 1982, § 151.48; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 972F, § 1, 7-3-95) 


Sec. 151.48.5. - Dedication of park lands and school sites or for payments of fees in lieu thereof. 
    As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, of a final plat of a planned unit development, 
or of a final plat of a mobile home park, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for 
park, recreational, conservation and school purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the 
residents of the development, or will be required to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land 
dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the city after consultation with the affected district, in 
accordance with the following criteria and formulas: 
(1) ?Criteria for requiring park, recreational and conservation land dedication. 
a. ?Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall 
bear directly on the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement for parks 
and recreational areas shall be 6.25 acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate population and may 
be allocated by the city council in its discretion based upon the following criteria. The total 
requirement for conservation areas shall be 6.25 acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate 
population.

These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and 
literature on the subject, including but not limited to, the National Land Park Association's 
Recreation, Park and Open Space Standards and Guidelines, 1990 and A Report to 
Belvidere Park District and Boone County Conservation District on the Costs of Growth, 
completed by the Center for Governmental Studies, Northern Illinois University, November 
17, 1993. These requirements shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements 
and shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely 
objected to as provided herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular 
development shall be made in accordance with subsection (9) of this section to the 
planning and zoning commission (P&Z). Failure to timely object to these acreage 
requirements in accordance with subsection (9) of this section shall thereafter waive any 
right to raise an objection at a later time. 
b. ?Location. The park recreation and conservation plans as adopted by the township park 
district, the county conservation district, and the city's comprehensive plan shall be used as 
a guideline in locating sites. A central location that will serve equally the entire 
development is most desirable. In large developments, these sites can be located 
throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances. 
c. ?Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas. When subdividers or developers 
provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it may have the effect of 
reducing the demand for local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the 
development, a portion of the park, recreation or conservation area in subdivisions or 
planned unit developments may, at the sole option of the city council after consultation with 
the affected district, be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated 
"public open space." The extent of the space shall be determined by the city council based 
on the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park, recreation 
and conservation land for the general area. 
In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a 
substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreation facilities, 
including equipment, by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such 
areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the city after 
consultation with the affected district; and before any credit is given for private recreation 
areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee by the execution of the appropriate 
legal documents, that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for 
such use. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be 
necessary to complete the total park land dedication that would have been required from 
the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given. 
(2) ?Criteria for requiring school site dedication. 
a. ?Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a 
subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of land required 
to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by 
obtaining the ratio of: (a) Estimated children to be served in each such school classification 
over the (b) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school 
classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to (c) the appropriate number 
of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product 
thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to 
serve the estimated increase in number of children in each such school classification. 
b. ?School classifications and size of school site. School classifications and size of school sites 
within the city shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:

These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and 
literature on the subject, including but not limited to information provided by the state 
superintendent of education, state board of education; A Report to Belvidere Community 
Unit School District #100 and North Boone School District #200 on the Costs of Growth, 
completed by the Center for Governmental Studies, Northern Illinois University, November 
17, 1993, and the unique characteristics of Boone County, including its generally rural 
character and its open spaces and the desire of its residents to maintain this character and 
open space in their future school sites. These requirements for acreage shall be presumed 
as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu 
of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in subsection (9) of this 
section. 
Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in 
accordance with subsection (9) of this section to the planning and zoning commission 
(P&Z). 
Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in accordance with subsection (9) of 
this section shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
c. ?Location. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected 
school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
(3) ?Criteria for requiring a cash contribution in lieu of park and school sites. When the development 
is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical, or when the available land is 
inappropriate for park recreational and conservation purposes or a school site, the city, after 
consultation with the affected district, shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash 
contribution in lieu of the land dedication. The cash contribution in lieu of park, recreation and 
conservation land dedication shall be held in trust by the city or other public body designated by 
the city to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or 
development and may be used for any purpose authorized by state statute or by agreement of 
the owner/developer. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the 
city or other public body designated by the city and shall be used for any purpose authorized by 
state statute or by agreement of the owner/developer, to serve the immediate or future needs of 
children from that subdivision or development or for the improvement to any existing school site 
that already serves such needs. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park, recreation 
and conservation land dedication or cash contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for 
the purposes set forth herein within 13 years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the 
then current owner(s) of the subdivided property. If there is more than one record owner of the 
subdivided land or of the land that comprises the planned unit development, as applicable, such 
record owners shall share in the refund on a pro rata basis using the latest assessed valuation 
for all such land. The city may deduct its expenses, not to exceed ten percent of the amount 
refunded, in making the refund. 
a. ?Fair market value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market 
value of the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as park, 
recreation, conservation and school sites. The fair market value, on a per-acre basis, shall 
assume, unless determined otherwise pursuant to subsection (9) of this section, that the 
land is zoned residential, subdivided, stubbed with city sewer and water, has all 
appropriate utilities available, is improved as set forth in subsections (7) and (8) of this 
section, and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development. 
Based upon a study of real estate transactions in the city and county for the years 2001, 
2002, and 2003, it has been determined that the present fair market value of such 
improved land for parks, recreation and school purposes in and surrounding the city is, as 
of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived $120,000.00 per 
acre. This figure may be adjusted by the city council from time to time. The fair market 
value as defined above shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution 
herein unless timely objected to as provided in subsection (9) of this section. Objections to 
the fair market value as defined above shall be made in accordance with subsection (9) of 
this section to the planning and zoning commission (P&Z). Failure to timely object to the 
fair market value as defined above in accordance with subsection (9) of this section shall 
thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
b. ?Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee. There will be situations in subdivisions or 
planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in 
lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
1. ?Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park site, 
school site or conservation site (that portion of the land within the subdivision falling 
within the park, conservation or school location shall be dedicated as a site as stated 
above, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land 
that would have been required to be dedicated); and 
2. ?A major part of the local park site or conservation site or school site has already been 
acquired by the particular district and only a small portion of land is needed from the 
development to complete the site (the remaining portion shall be required by 
dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required). 
c. ?County conservation district. It is recognized that it is more likely than not that land will not 
usually be available from a proposed development at locations reasonably usable for the 
county conservation district. It is also realized that the majority of land utilized by the 
conservation district need not be fully improved and stubbed with city utilities and is 
frequently of a lower value than other lands. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, when cash is payable instead of land, the city council finds that 
cash for the district is based upon $20,700.00 per acre with an acreage requirement of 12 
acres. 
(4) ?Density formula. 
a. ?The following table of population density is generally indicative of current and short-range 
projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the 
amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof 
unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer:

* Source: Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc., 
Naperville, Illinois, 1993 and A report to Belvidere Community Unit School District #100 
and North Boone School District #200 on the Costs of Growth, completed by the Center for 
Governmental Studies, Northern Illinois University, November 17, 1993. 
b. ?A bedroom as used in this section shall include any den, study or extra room located on 
any floor in a dwelling unit which may be used or converted into a sleeping area and which 
is not clearly identified for some other specific purpose such as for a kitchen (one per unit), 
a dining room (one per unit), a living room (one per unit), a bathroom, and a family room 
(one per unit), provided the family room is at least the same size as or larger than the living 
room or there is no living room but only a family room. 
c. ?In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table of estimated 
ultimate population listed above, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the 
estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit 
development, and in that event, final determination of the density formula shall be made in 
accordance with subsection (9) of this section. This table of estimated ultimate population 
per dwelling unit shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein 
unless objected to as provided in subsection (9) of this section. Objections to the table of 
estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit shall be made in accordance with 
subsection (9) of this section to the planning and zoning commission (P&Z). Failure to 
object to the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling in accordance with 
subsection (9) of this section shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later 
time. 
(5) ?Reservation of additional land. When the comprehensive plan or the standards of the city 
indicate necessity for providing a larger amount of park recreational or conservation land or 
school sites within the proposed subdivision, planned unit development, or mobile home park 
than the developer is required to dedicate pursuant to this section, the land needed beyond the 
developer's contribution shall be set aside and reserved and designated by the developer for 
subsequent purchase by the city or other public body designated by the city, provided that such 
acquisition is made by purchase or commencement of condemnation proceedings within one 
year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
(6) ?Combining with adjoining developments. If the subdivision, planned unit development or mobile 
home park is less than 40 acres, public open space or a school site that is to be dedicated 
should, if possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to 
produce usable recreation, park and conservation areas and/or school sites without hardship on 
a particular developer. 
(7) ?Land dedication/site requirements: 
a. ?Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well 
as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose. No wetlands nor any portion 
of the floodway shall be accepted for city ownership and maintenance, and shall not serve 
as a credit toward the park, recreational, conservation or school site contribution. Storm 
water detention areas shall not be accepted for city ownership and maintenance, and the 
portion of a detention area designed to function primarily as a component of the 
stormwater control system shall not serve as a credit toward the required park, 
recreational, conservation or school site contribution. Retention areas shall not be 
accepted for city ownership and maintenance and shall not serve as a credit toward the 
required park, recreational, conservation or school site contribution. A park, recreational, 
conservation or school site shall be not less than one acre in area. Wetlands, floodplains, 
floodways, detention areas, retention areas, and areas of steep slope shall not be 
accepted as school sites and shall not serve as a credit toward the required school site 
cash in lieu of land contribution. 
For any land to be dedicated, the slope shall not vary significantly from existing and 
adjacent slopes and shall have an optimum range between two (2) and five percent. In no 
case shall the slope be less than two percent nor more than ten percent. All on site 
drainage shall conform to the reasonable directives of the city's public works department 
and shall ensure drainage into appropriate swales and away from the intended active use 
of the area. All dedicated lands shall be rough-graded at the owner/developer's expense at 
the time of rough-grading of adjacent areas. The grading shall comply with city-approved 
plans by the department of public works. The subgrade material shall be loosened and 
fine-graded with all stones (of more than four inches in size), natural debris (e.g. sticks, 
twigs, brush) and foreign substances removed. 
The dedicated land shall include not less than six inches of topsoil over the entire site. All 
soils shall be compatible with those naturally occurring. developer shall provide an 
environmental risk audit (phase I) as set forth herein and shall provide any further audits or 
remediation recommended by the phase I audit or required further audits. 
b. ?Improved sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, 
cable television, high speed internet fiber (if available in areas adjacent to the 
development), telephone, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb 
and gutter), as applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the 
requirements of this chapter. The landscaping normally included within the definition of 
"improved" sites under this chapter may be deleted due to the delay time between 
dedication of any such school site and the construction of school facilities thereon. All 
school sites and park sites shall be accessible by a 25-foot wide bicycle/pedestrian trail 
acceptable to the city. If a development contains both a park site and a school site and/or if 
a bicycle/pedestrian trail exists adjacent to the proposed development, then the 
bicycle/pedestrian trail required by this section shall be interconnected directly with the 
adjacent trail and the other park/school site. Consistent with the city's subdivision code, all 
dedicated sites shall be improved with sidewalks fronting upon all adjacent streets. Every 
site to be dedicated shall have direct access to a fully improved and dedicated street with 
at least 20 percent frontage upon said street. All access routes and required paths shall be 
dedicated to the city upon completion. 
c. ?Environmental conditions. 
1. ?Hazardous substance: Hazardous substances shall include, without limitation, any 
hazardous substance or waste, extremely hazardous substance, toxic substance, 
toxic chemical, toxic wastes, hazardous chemicals, hazardous wastes, solid waste or 
pesticides as defined by any present or future federal, state, county or local law, 
statute or ordinance or regulation relating to the protection of the environment, 
including but not limited to, CERCLA, OSHA, RCRA, the Illinois Responsible Property 
Transfer Act and the Federal Environmental Protection Act and the regulations of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. Hazardous substances shall also include 
petroleum, its byproducts including, but not limited to, MTBE, as regulated under 
RCRA and any applicable state or local laws or regulations. 
2. ?Prior to the transfer of any dedicated land, the owner/developer shall provide the city 
and the intended grantee district an environmental audit reasonably acceptable to the 
grantee district and the city which meets the minimum pre-acquisition requirements of 
section 22.2 of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (the Act) (commonly referred 
to as a phase I audit). The audit shall be performed and certified by an environmental 
professional as defined by section 22.2(j) of the Act. 
3. ?If the phase I audit fails to conclude that there is no presence or release or likely 
presence or likely release of hazardous substances or pesticides on, under to or from 
the dedicated site, the owner/developer shall obtain and provide a phase II 
environmental audit as set forth in section 22.2 of the Act. The phase II audit shall 
include a soil toxicity analysis and recommendations from the environmental 
professional which complies with section 22.2 of the Act and concludes that there is 
no presence or release or likely presence or likely release of hazardous substances or 
pesticides on, under to or from the dedicated site and that the environmental 
professional is of the opinion that there is no reasonable probability that the dedicated 
site contains any hazardous substances in violation of any federal, state or local 
environmental law or regulation. 
4. ?If the phase II audit discloses the existence, or reasonably likely presence, of a 
hazardous substance or the release or a substantial threat of a release of any 
hazardous substance on, under, to or from the dedicated land, the owner/developer 
shall, at the grantee sole district's option, either: 
(i) ?Not dedicate the subject property and instead either pay the cash in lieu of land 
or provide an alternative site acceptable to the grantee district; or 
(ii) ?Cause all hazardous substances to be removed at the owner/developer's sole 
expense and furnish the grantee district a "no further remediation" letter from all 
relevant governmental agencies. 
d. ?Soils. The owner/developer shall, at its sole expense, obtain and provide the grantee 
district typical soils test and data, including but not limited to, soil boring tests and data, soil 
compaction test results, and such other data and test results which the grantee district or 
the city may reasonably request. If the results of any such test are not acceptable to the 
grantee district, it may reject the site, in which case the owner/developer shall, at the 
grantee district's option, either: 
1. ?Not dedicate the subject property and instead pay the cash in lieu of land; or 
2. ?Provide an alternative site acceptable to the grantee district. 
e. ?Prior to conveyance, the owner/developer shall have the dedicated property surveyed by a 
licensed state land surveyor and shall establish monuments and land stakes identifying the 
lot lines of the dedicated property. 
f. ?Conveyance. All dedicated property shall be dedicated to the grantee district by recordable 
warranty deed subject only to real estate taxes and special assessments (hereinafter real 
estate taxes) which are not yet due and payable, utility easements located on the perimeter 
of the dedicated property, drainage ditches, feeders, laterals, underground pipe and other 
conduit, all located upon the perimeter of the dedicated property (jointly referred to as the 
permitted exceptions). 
Each warranty deed shall be accompanied by a written commitment issued by a title insurance 
company (the title company) licensed to do business in the state to insure title and who is 
reasonably acceptable to the grantee district. The title policy shall be in an amount equal to the 
fair market value of the dedicated property as set forth in this chapter ($120,000.00 per acre or 
part thereof) and will contain extended coverage over the general exceptions and shall only be 
subject to the permitted exceptions. 
The owner/developer shall provide a current ALTA boundary line survey, prepared by the 
surveyor identified in subsection e. above, certified to the grantee district and in compliance with 
the American Land Survey Standards, showing no encroachments or other defects. 
If the dedicated property is not a lot in a recorded subdivision, the owner/developer shall 
prepare an assessment plat and tax division petition in a form acceptable to the city and grantee 
district. 
The real estate taxes not yet due and payable shall be prorated as of the conveyance date on 
the basis of 110 percent of the tax assessor's latest assessed valuation, latest known 
equalization factors and tax rate for the dedicated property. The owner/developer shall deposit 
said amount in escrow with the title company who shall pay the real estate taxes when they are 
due and payable. The owner/developer shall pay the cost of said escrow. If the latest known tax 
information on the last tax bill covering the dedicated property includes property not being 
dedicated, the escrow sum shall be adjusted ratably based upon net acreage. The 
owner/developer shall indemnify and hold the city and the grantee district harmless from any 
such real estate taxes and in the event the amount in the real estate tax escrow is insufficient to 
pay said real estate taxes, the owner/developer shall deposit such additional sums necessary to 
cover the short fall. 
(8) ?Reserved. 
(9) ?Objections. 
a. ?First referral. All objections relating to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair 
market value, the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit or any other 
application of this section to a particular subdivision or planned development shall first be 
referred to the planning and zoning commission (P&Z) for hearing. In the event the 
planning and zoning commission has not been created as of the date of the appeal, the 
appeal will be to the plan commission). An objection must be made, if at all, prior to the 
approval by the city of the final plat. A failure to object by such time shall constitute a 
waiver of the right to object to the provisions of this section. 
b. ?Duties of the planning and zoning commission (P&Z). The planning and zoning commission 
(P&Z) shall serve in an advisory capacity and shall have the following duties: 
1. ?Advise and assist the city in resolving objections regarding the table of ultimate 
population in subsection (4) of this section, the size of the dedicated sites in 
subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the fair market value of the land used to 
calculate the cash contribution or any other application of this section to a particular 
subdivision, planned development or mobile home park. 
2. ?The city shall adopt procedural rules to be used by the planning and zoning 
commission (P&Z) in carrying out the duties imposed by this section. 
c. ?Resources available. The city will cooperate with the planning and zoning commission 
(P&Z) in fulfilling its duties herein. The city shall make available to the planning and zoning 
commission (P&Z), all professional reports relating to the table of ultimate population, the 
size of the dedicated sites, and the fair market value of land used in calculating these fees. 
The planning and zoning commission (P&Z) may also retain the services of professionals 
(attorneys, appraisers, statisticians, etc.,) to assist them in their review of issues raised by 
any objection. 
d. ?Procedure for resolving an objection. 
1. ?Upon receipt of an objection, the city clerk shall place the same on the next regular 
agenda of the city council. Thereafter, the city council shall refer the objection to the 
planning and zoning commission (P&Z), and the planning and zoning commission 
(P&Z) shall establish a hearing date. 
2. ?The objector shall provide notice, at the objector's expense, of the hearing date to 
consider the objection by notifying affected school, park and conservation districts by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, of the filing of the objection and circulation 
within the city. The notice shall be entitled "notice of public hearing to consider an 
objection to the application of an ordinance requiring the dedication of park, 
conservation and school lands or cash in lieu thereof". The notice shall state the time, 
place and purpose of the public hearing as well as a general description of the lands 
to be subdivided and shall be approved by the city attorney, as to form, prior to 
publication. Strict conformance with these notice procedures is jurisdictional and a 
failure to provide evidence (i.e. publisher's affidavit and certified mail receipts) prior to 
the public hearing shall prevent the holding of the public hearing. In the event that 
notice is not properly demonstrated, the planning and zoning commission (P&Z) shall 
set a new date for a public hearing with sufficient time for the objector to provide new 
notice in conformance with these requirements. 
3. ?A public hearing shall be held for the consideration of the objection. Any affected 
school, park and conservation district shall be allowed to participate in such hearing 
as a party thereto to present evidence, cross examine witnesses and make arguments 
to the planning and zoning commission (P&Z) regarding the issues raised in objection. 
The planning and zoning commission (P&Z) shall make a recommendation to adopt, 
reject in whole or in part, or modify the objection presented at the hearing, by written 
report to the city. The city shall then have at least 60 days to approve, disapprove or 
modify, by ordinance or resolution, the findings in this section as it pertains to the 
development in question. 
e. ?Costs and fees. The objector shall bear all costs of a hearing before the planning and 
zoning commission (P&Z), including attendance fees paid by the planning and zoning 
commission (P&Z) members, notification costs, professional consultants and any other 
expenses. Before a hearing date is set, the objector shall deposit with the city a $10,000.00 
escrow to cover these costs, which shall be replenished monthly by the objector after 
payment of any outstanding expenses incurred by the city. 
(10) ?Annexations. The dedications of land or cash contribution in lieu thereof required by this 
section shall also be required as a condition to the annexation of any land to the city, and 
provisions thereof shall at a minimum be incorporated in any annexation agreement governing 
such land. However, the city reserves the right to negotiate dedications of land or cash in lieu of 
land or a combination thereof greater than those set forth herein. 
(11) ?Indemnification. As a precondition to the city's collecting school, park and conservation 
dedications and/or fees in lieu thereof, any district receiving the benefit of such dedication or fee 
in lieu thereof shall execute an indemnification agreement in the form set forth in exhibit A 
[attached to Ordinance 609G and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk]. The city 
may elect not to collect any fees in lieu of land until such time as the indemnification agreement 
is signed by the benefiting district and returned to the city. The indemnification shall be 
executed on a yearly basis on or before May 1st. Additionally, the city will withhold any fees in 
lieu of land until a benefiting district, in writing, requests payment of those fees and submits a 
signed indemnification agreement and a statement that the benefiting district has complied with 
subsection (12) herein. 
(12) ?Distributions. 
a. ?The cash in lieu of land contribution imposed by this section shall be collected and held by 
the city to be distributed in accordance with the standards in this section to the appropriate 
benefiting district and to be used for the purposes set forth in this section. 
b. ?As a condition of distribution of these dedications and/or cash in lieu of land contribution, 
the city shall require that the school, park district or conservation district benefiting from 
such dedications and/or fees conduct a needs assessment and adopt a plan for acquisition 
of land and capital facilities needed to accommodate growth. 
c. ?Needs assessment and land and capital facilities acquisition plan. A needs assessment 
shall contain the following information for each district (school, park and conservation): 
1. ?A description of the nature and location of the existing park, conservation and school 
lands and existing park, school and conservation capital facilities within each district. 
2. ?Any identification of the capacity of each school building and park and conservation 
site within the particular district and of the number of students then enrolled in each 
school building. 
3. ?A projection of the character and location of new development that is expected to 
occur within each district during the succeeding ten-year period. 
4. ?An identification of the amount of park, conservation and school lands that will be 
necessary within each district in order to accommodate the demands of such 
projected new development, and an estimate of the public grounds acquisition costs 
that will be incurred by each district in acquiring such lands. 
5. ?A general description of each classification of park, conservation and school capital 
facilities (including construction, expansion or enhancement of any public facilities and 
the land improvement, design, engineering and professional costs related thereto) that 
will be necessary within each district in order to provide park, conservation and school 
capacity for the projected new development, and an estimate of the capital facilities 
costs that will be incurred by each benefiting district in constructing such capital 
facilities. 
d. ?Based upon the needs assessment, each benefiting district shall provide the city an 
acquisition plan for park, conservation and school lands and capital facilities. This 
acquisition plan shall: 
1. ?Project for a planning period of at least five years, the need for park, conservation and 
school lands and capital facilities within the district. 
2. ?Set forth a schedule for the acquisition of such lands and facilities to meet the 
projected need (which schedule may be conditioned upon the availability of financing). 
3. ?Indicate the size and general location of the needed lands and facilities. 
4. ?Identify the estimated costs of acquiring such needed lands and facilities. 
5. ?Set forth the anticipated funding sources for the acquisition of such needed lands and 
facilities. 
6. ?Determine the feasibility of acquiring the needed land and facilities based upon the 
district's current financial condition. 
7. ?Determine the feasibility of acquiring the needed land and facilities based upon the 
district's estimate of the revenues (including, without limitation, cash in lieu of land 
contribution required by this section) pursuant to the plan. 
8. ?The impact on property taxes in the city assuming the plan is implemented. 
e. ?The city shall require an updated needs assessment and plan for acquisition of land and 
capital facilities from the district annually. 
(13) ?Time. 
a. ?All dedications and fees imposed by this section shall be due and payable upon final plat 
approval. However, the city may agree that payment of fees may be made at time of 
building permit issuance in consideration of which the subdivider or developer shall 
execute an agreement attached as exhibit B [to Ordinance 609G, available for inspection in 
the office of the city clerk], agreeing that the fees payable will be adjusted in accordance 
with the requirements of subsection (b) below and further agreeing that the fees may be 
expended for the purposes described in exhibit B, together with any other agreement 
required by the city to guarantee the payments or limit the time before which full payment 
may be required. A copy of the exhibit B agreement shall be recorded along with the final 
plat of subdivision after approval by the city council. Where property subject to this section 
is also subject to an annexation agreement, the owner/developer and city may rely upon 
the annexation agreement in lieu of exhibit b, provided the annexation agreement 
embodies substantially the same terms as exhibit B. 
b. ?In the event the owner/developer elects to pay any fee in lieu of land at the time of final plat 
approval, the fee dedication shall be calculated assuming the maximum density permitted 
for the zoning district (i.e. if the property is zoned single family residential, the fee will be 
calculated based upon a 5-bedroom single family detached dwelling). When the building 
department issues a final certificate of occupancy for a dwelling unit, the owner/developer 
may receive a refund of any excess fee paid (i.e. if the actual home built is a 4 bedroom 
single family detached unit, the owner/developer would receive a refund of the difference in 
the fee between a 5- and 4-bedroom home). In order to ensure the city's ability to make

of the contribution and building permit issuance. 
d. ?This section shall not affect in any way dedications or payments made pursuant to the 
provisions of any previous ordinance, including those portions of the subdivision code 
amended by this section. However, any lot which is vacant at the time the ordinance from 
which this section is derived is adopted, and for which fees in lieu of land have not been 
previously paid (i.e. at plat approval), shall pay the fees adopted by this section or any 
subsequent amendment hereto at the time a building permit is issued.

ARTICLE IV - COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS 


Sec. 151.60. - Improvements and performance bond. 
(a) ?Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed by the director of public works, the developer 
shall be required to complete, to the satisfaction of the department of public works, all the street, 
sanitary and other improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision 
as required in these regulations, specified in the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the city 
council and to make all required public dedications, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on 
the property and public improvements thus dedicated. 
(b) ?Performance bond. 
(1) ?The city council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the developer complete and 
dedicate all public improvements prior to the final approval of the subdivision plat, and that, as 
an alternative, the developer post a bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow, at the time of 
application for final subdivision approval in an amount estimated by the director of public works 
as sufficient to secure to the local government the satisfactory construction, installation and 
dedication of the incompleted portion of required improvements. The performance bond shall 
also secure all lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these 
regulations. 
(2) ?Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to 
the city attorney as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution as set forth in these 
regulations. The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be two 
years from date of final approval. Such bond shall be approved by the governing body as to 
amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the governing body. The director of public 
works may on proof of difficulty recommend to the city council extension of the completion date 
set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year. The city council may at any 
time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond. 
(c) ?Temporary improvements. The subdivider shall build and pay for all costs of temporary 
improvements required by the city council and shall maintain same for the period specified by the city 
council. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with 
the city council separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the 
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed. 
(d) ?Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the applicant, at his expense, 
without reimbursement by the government or any improvement district therein. 
(e) ?Failure to complete improvement. If the improvements are not completed within the period specified 
by the city council in the motion or resolution approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to 
have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required 
improvements have not been installed within terms of such performance bond, the city council may 
thereupon declare the bond to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed 
regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in fault. 
Bond shall include letters of credit and escrows, where appropriate. 
(f) ?Acceptance improvements. Acceptance of public improvements, public areas, easements, and parks 
shall be by resolution of the city council. The approval of the subdivision plat shall not be deemed to 
constitute or imply the acceptance of any public improvement, easement or park shown on the plat. 
The city council may require the plat to be endorsed with the appropriate notes to this effect. 
(Code 1982, § 151.60; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.61. - Inspection of improvements. 
(a) ?General. The city council shall provide for inspection for required improvements during construction 
and ensure their satisfactory completion. Costs of review and inspection to be paid by developer 
according to the fee schedule. 
(b) ?Release or reduction of performance security. 
(1) ?Certificate of satisfactory completion. The city council shall not accept dedication of required 
improvements, nor release any performance security, until the director of public works has 
submitted a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily 
completed. Prior to the director issuing the certificate, the developer shall submit the following: 
(i) ?Certification from the developer's engineer or surveyor that the layout of the line and grade 
of all public improvements are in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision, 
have been completed and are ready for dedication to the local government. 
(ii) ?A general contractor's sworn statement, referred to as the contractor's affidavit, or persons 
furnishing materials and labor for the construction of the public improvements and lien 
waivers from each contractor listed in the contractor's affidavit. 
(iii) ?As-built construction plans in a digital format acceptable to the director of public works. 
On such approval and recommendation, the city council may thereafter accept the 
improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure. 
(2) ?Reduction of performance security. A performance security shall only be reduced according to 
the following schedule during the course of development and then only upon written 
recommendation by the director of public works and approval by the city council that certain 
improvements have been completed. In no event shall a performance bond/letter of credit be 
reduced below the greater of either 125 percent of the engineer's estimate of the remaining 
uncompleted items (public improvements) or the amounts listed below: 
Project Value of All Public Improvements Based on Approved Engineer's Estimate of Cost. 
Up to $100,000.00—One reduction of up to 25 percent of the original amount. 
$100,001.00—$1,000,000.00—Two reductions of up to 15 percent of the original amount. 
$1,000,000.00 or more—Two reductions of up to ten percent of the original amount.

(Code 1982, § 151.62; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.63. - Deferral or waiver of required improvements. 
(a) ?The city council may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, 
the provision of any or all such improvements as, in its judgment, are not required in the interests of 
the public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or 
lack of connecting facilities. 
(b) ?Whenever it is deemed necessary by the city council to defer the construction of any improvement 
required herein because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting 
facilities, or for other reasons, the developer shall pay his share of the costs of the future 
improvements to the city prior to signing of the final subdivision plat, or the applicant may post a 
bond insuring completion of the improvements on demand of the city. 
(Code 1982, § 151.63; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.64. - Issuance of building permits. 
(a) ?Where a performance bond has been required for a subdivision, building permits shall be issued 
provided that the extent of street improvements shall be adequate for vehicular access by the 
prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment. 
(b) ?The developer shall maintain in constant repair a road surface complying with the requirements in 
subsection (a). 
(c) ?At the discretion of the city building official, if in his opinion the minimum access requirement is not 
met, he shall withhold further building permits and/or further inspections until such time appropriate 
improvements for access have been made. 
(d) ?Where a development is being constructed in phases, no building permits shall be issued in the 
subsequent phase until all public improvements in the previous phase have been completed and 
accepted by the city council with the exception of final pavement surface and sidewalks. The 
developer may request a waiver of this requirement from the public works director if unfinished items 
are out of the direct control of the developer. 
(Code 1982, § 151.64; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 861F, § 3, 7-5-94) 


Sec. 151.65. - Issuance of occupancy permit. 
    Occupancy of the building shall not take place until an occupancy permit has been issued by the city 
building official. The city building official shall not issue an occupancy permit unless the building meets all 
appropriate building construction standards. In addition the city building official shall not issue an 
occupancy permit until receipt of approval by the city department of public works concerning: 
(1) ?Sidewalks and driveways. Sidewalks and driveway approaches must be installed prior to 
issuance of an occupancy permit. Alternatively, upon written request from the then owner of the 
lot requesting the occupancy permit, the director of the building department may, but is not 
obligated to, agree to issue the occupancy permit if the owner agrees to escrow an amount, in 
the director's discretion, sufficient to pay the cost of installing the sidewalk and driveway 
approach. The escrow shall be a joint order escrow acceptable to the city and shall provide that 
all sidewalks and driveways shall be completed by July 1 for escrows made between November 
1 and May 15 If escrows are initiated at other times, work must be completed within 45 days 
from the date the occupancy permit is issued. If they are not completed within said time, then 
the escrow shall be turned over to the city. The escrow shall be held by an escrowee acceptable 
to the city, including, but not limited to, the title company acting as escrow agent for the sale of 
the property. The owner shall pay any fees associated with the escrow and shall defend, 
indemnify and hold the city harmless from any claim, damage or suit relating to the escrow. 
Owner further agrees and understands that the use of such escrow, and delay in completion of 
the sidewalk and driveway approach, is voluntary on owner's part and therefore, owner agrees 
not to challenge the validity of this section. 
(2) ?Drainage facilities. Drainage facilities, including detention/retention ponds, must be completed. 
(3) ?Grading. Grading of topsoil and seeding must be completed or cost of improvement escrowed. 
(4) ?Water meters and outside readers and backflow devices. Must be paid for, installed, tested and 
inspected. 
(Code 1982, § 151.65; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93; Ord. No. 556G, § 3, 4-7-03) 


Sec. 151.70. - Private streets. 
(a) ?Scope of section. This section is to provide for a private street, to be owned by an association of 
owners of the adjoining properties. A private street may be created in a new subdivision, or 
anywhere in the city on an existing subdivision, or on any street already owned and managed by the 
city, in accordance with the terms of this section. The city council shall have discretion to accept or 
reject an application to create a private street. 
(b) ?Procedure. Application to create a private street in a new subdivision shall be made by including in 
the application all necessary information to show compliance with the terms of this section in the 
papers filed with the application for approval of the plat of subdivision. Application for closing an 
existing street shall be made by an application signed by all of the owners of all of the property 
contiguous to the street or portion of street proposed to be turned into a private street. Whether the 
private street is to be in a new subdivision or on an existing street, the application will be 
accompanied by proposed articles of incorporation and proposed bylaws for a not-for-profit 
corporation to be formed, for all of the owners of property adjoining the private street, to maintain the 
street and to carry out the responsibilities of the association under this section. The planning 
commission will hold a hearing on the proposal and make a recommendation to the city council and 
the appropriate council committee. The city council may accept or reject the proposal. If the city 
council accepts the proposal, the not-for-profit corporation will be formed, and owners of all of the 
property will sign all documents necessary to create a covenant running with the land agreeing to 
abide by all of the requirements of the association, including the requirement to pay dues to the 
association. If the city council approves the proposal and if the association and the owners of 
adjoining property sign all the necessary documents to comply with the terms of this section, the city 
will vacate the street, reserving easements for all public utilities in the street, including but not limited 
to sewer, water, gas, electric, telephone and cable television utilities. 
(c) ?Guidelines. In determining whether to approve the private street under the terms of this section, the 
city council will consider the following guidelines: 
(1) ?The street is a residential street, either single-family or multiple-family. 
(2) ?The closing will not create an undue burden on traffic. 
(3) ?Closing is necessary to prevent traffic from traveling through the neighborhood to destinations 
outside of the neighborhood. 
(4) ?The residents in the neighborhood desire to maintain the residential quality of the 
neighborhood. 
(5) ?It is to the best interests of the city, considering planning for the entire city, to close the street. 
(d) ?Requirements for a private street. Any private street created under the terms of this section shall 
comply with the following requirements: 
(1) ?One end of the street may be closed permanently, but one end of the street must provide 
access at all times, either by open intersection, or by a closed gate with a guard, available at all 
times that the gate is closed to open the gate to any person desiring to enter. 
(2) ?Each private street created under the terms of this section shall have at the entrance to the 
private street, a sign saying, "private street," "private lane," or other legend indicating the same 
meaning. If the entrance to the street is attended by a guard, the guard may enforce the rules 
approved by the nonprofit corporation established for the owners of adjoining property and may 
refuse to admit persons who do not live in the territory or have any business or errand requiring 
them to enter the private street. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to permit any 
nonprofit corporation or any guard from prohibiting any person desiring to enter the area for 
purpose of disseminating any religious opinions, or disseminating any political opinions or 
opinions relating to any election, or to prohibit any other activity protected by state and federal 
constitutional provisions relating to free speech. 
(e) ?Responsibility of nonprofit corporation. The nonprofit corporation formed for the owners of adjoining 
property shall have the responsibility of maintaining the street and any sidewalks or other public 
ways along the private street. The nonprofit corporation shall require all the property owners of 
adjoining properties to pay regular dues to cover all costs of maintaining the street. An annual budget 
shall be prepared by the nonprofit corporation to assist in arriving at dues. 
(f) ?Law enforcement assistance. The city shall have the responsibility of enforcing the laws and 
providing police protection on the closed street. The nonprofit corporation to be formed, and the 
individuals who own property and live in the area, shall have the responsibility of assisting the police 
by watching for unusual activity and by calling the police in the event that any suspicious activity is 
observed in the area. 
(g) ?Other functions of nonprofit corporation. At the time the application is made to create a private 
street, the application may indicate other duties for the nonprofit corporation, such as providing for 
block parties, maintaining any park or park facilities owned by the nonprofit corporation for the 
benefit of the owners and residents in the adjoining properties, or to perform any other function for 
the mutual benefit of the owners and residents in the area. 
(h) ?Penalty. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor 
more than the maximum as provided in section 1-9 for each offense, and a separate offense shall be 
deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. 
(i) ?Civil liability. Should the city be required to make repairs and maintenance on the private street and 
expend funds, labor and materials for such repairs and maintenance, the city shall have a lien on the 
adjoining properties shall also be liable jointly and severally for such repairs. The plat of subdivision 
shall contain a covenant reflecting the property and owners civil liability under this section. 
(Code 1982, § 151.70; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


Sec. 151.99. - Penalty. 
    Violations of this chapter shall be subject to punishment as provided in section 1-9. Each day's 
violation shall constitute a separate violation. Nothing in this section shall preclude the city from obtaining 
equitable relief in appropriate cases. 
(Code 1982, § 151.99; Ord. No. 788F, § 1, 5-17-93) 


APPENDIX A: - REQUIRED CERTIFICATES 
    The following certificates shall be required unless the city council approves the plat, without approval 
by the planning commission or director of public works. In such case, the city council's certificate shall 
constitute a waiver of the requirement of those two certificates.
