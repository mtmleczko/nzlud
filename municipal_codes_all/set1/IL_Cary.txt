PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Cary, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code as amended through February 14, 2014. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in title order, and the various sections within each title have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Arrangement and Numbering System 
    The arrangement and numbers scheme used in the Code is the same as used in the 1981 Code. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Mike Coppedge, Village Attorney, Mr. Chris Clark, Village Administrator, Mr. Pat Finlon, Police Chief, and Mr. Chris Stilling, Community Development Director, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to pay the fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits, and upon the exhaustion of the administrative review procedures. When a person fails to appear at his scheduled hearing to contest an alleged violation, the Administrative Law Judge's determination of violation liability shall become final upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing having been made. 
J.  Appeals. A petition to void a determination may be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty and shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the finding of liability and shall be ruled upon by the Administrative Law Judge. The grounds for such a petition are limited to: 
1.  The person was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued; or 
2.  The person had paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question; or 
3.  Excusable failure to appear at or request a date for a hearing. 
When it has been determined there is just cause, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for the violation. 
K.  Procedures for nonresidents. If an alleged violator does not reside within the State, the violation may be contested in writing. In such circumstances, the Administrative Law Judge must receive a request in writing from the nonresident to contest the violation seven (7) days prior to the initial hearing. If the Administrative Law Judge receives such a written request, the nonresident may submit his or her position, in writing, why the issuance of the violation was improper.

Sec. 2.300.85. - Election of remedies. 
    In no case may the Unit conduct an administrative adjudication proceeding for an alleged violation of this Code where the remedy provided is a punishment of imprisonment; provided, however, where a violation of the Code is punishable by fines and other penalties in addition to imprisonment, the Village may elect to institute an action with the Unit and waive any imprisonment for the Code violation. Nothing in this chapter, however, shall preclude the Village from seeking the remedy of imprisonment in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 2.300.90. - Fines and costs applicable to all offenses.

If the recipient of the minimum fine imposed does not pay the fine by 12:00 midnight on the fourteenth (14th) day following the date the fine was issued, said minimum fine and penalty shall increase by not less than double the minimum fine nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00).

(1)  Identification of relevant red flags. The Village has considered the guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the FTC's Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the Village's past history with instances of identity theft, if any. The Village hereby determines that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this program given the relative size of the Village and the limited nature and scope of the services that the Village provides to its citizens:

a)  A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries; 
b)  An unusual number of recently established credit relationships; 
c)  A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or 
d)  An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor. 
B.  The presentation of suspicious documents.

5.  An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled. 
C.  The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address change.

a)  The address does not match any address in the consumer report or CRA 10 Check response; or 
b)  The social security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File. 
2.  Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.

5.  The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers. 
6.  The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers. 
7.  The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete. 
8.  Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the Village. 
9.  If the Village uses challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report. 
D.  The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account. 
1.  Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the Village receives a request for additional authorized users on the account. 
2.  A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud patterns (e.g., the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments). 
3.  A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities. 
4.  A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors). 
5.  Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although usage of utility products or services continues in connection with the customer's covered account. 
6.  The Village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements. 
7.  The Village is notified of unauthorized usage of utility products or services in connection with a customer's covered account. 
E.  Notice of possible identity theft. The Village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that the Village has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft. 
(2)  Detection of red flags. 
A.  The Village staff members who interact directly with customers on a day-to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility for monitoring the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and the modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that all Village staff members who might be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in this program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in connection with the transaction. A Village staff member who is not sufficiently trained to recognize the red flags identified in this program shall not open a new account for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer with access to information in an existing account without the direct supervision and specific approval of the Finance Director or Village Administrator. Management employees shall be properly trained such that they can recognize the relevant red flags identified in this program and exercise sound judgment in connection with the response to any unresolved red flags that may present themselves in connection with the opening of a new account or with modifying or accessing of an existing account. The Village Administrator or Finance Director shall be responsible for making the final decision on any such unresolved red flags. 
B.  The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility service account, the steps to be taken by Village staff assisting the customer with the application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party service provider shall be maintained. Such policy shall be generally consistent with the spirit of the Customer Identification Program rules (31 CFR 103.121) implementing Section 326(a) of the USA Patriot Act, but need not be as detailed. The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or otherwise gain access to existing accounts. 
(3)  Response to detected red flags. 
A.  If the responsible staff members of the Village as set forth in Subsection (2) of this section are unable, after making a good faith effort, to form a reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing account based on the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party service provider, the Village shall not open the new account or modify or otherwise provide access to the existing account, as the case may be. 
B.  The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to the aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity theft when a red flag is detected include: 
1.  Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft. 
2.  Contacting the customer. 
3.  Changing any passwords, security codes or other security devices that permit access to a covered account. 
4.  Reopening a covered account with a new number. 
5.  Not opening a new covered account. 
6.  Closing an existing covered account. 
7.  Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt collector. 
8.  Notifying law enforcement. 
9.  Determining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances. 
(Ord. No. O08-11-01, § 3.48.050, 11-5-2008) 
Sec. 3.48.060. - Program management and accountability. 
A.  Initial risk assessment; covered accounts. Utility accounts for personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the definition of "covered account" in the FTC's Identity Theft Rules. Therefore, the Village determines that with respect to its residential utility accounts it offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The Village also performed an initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or maintains any other accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or the utility from identity theft. In making this determination, the Village considered the methods it uses to open its accounts; the methods it uses to access its accounts; and its previous experience with identity theft; and it concluded that it does not offer or maintain any such other covered accounts. 
B.  Program updates; risk assessment. The program, including relevant red flags, is to be updated as often as necessary to reflect changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the program update include: 
1.  An assessment of the risk factors identified in Subsection A of this section. 
2.  Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or procedures. 
3.  Changes in methods of identity theft. 
4.  Changes in methods to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. 
5.  Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures and service provider arrangements. 
C.  Training and oversight. All Village staff and third-party service providers performing any activity in connection with one (1) or more covered accounts are to be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent and mitigate the risk of identity theft.

Sec. 3.52.150. - Voluntary disclosure. 
    For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer.

2.  A person shall not be in violation of this Subsection F if he or she requests assistance from the Police Department or other law enforcement agency to either remove any person who refuses to abide by the person's performance of the duties imposed by this Subsection F or terminate the activity because the person has been unable to prevent a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years from consuming alcohol despite having taken all reasonable steps to do so and this assistance is requested before any other person makes a formal complaint to the Police Department or other law enforcement agency about the activity. 
G.  Renting of hotel or motel rooms.

The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any applicable law. 
B.  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the Village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
1.  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the permittee; 
2.  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and 
3.  Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn. 
C.  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Village, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase. The security fund for each construction project will be ten dollars ($10.00) per lineal foot of the project, or the company may post a yearly cash retainer or letter of credit for twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) (replenished yearly), or a bond for an amount determined by the Village, for all construction work to be complete that year. 
D.  Withdrawals.

Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
1.  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
2.  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
3.  Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or 
4.  Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
E.  Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in Subsection C of this section. 
F.  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for such withdrawal to the Village; provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in Subsection C of this section. 
G.  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of such revocation; provided that any amounts in excess of such costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
H.  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

Sec. 12.19.050. - Collocation requirements and conditions. 
A.  Public safety space reservation . The Village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
B.  Installation and maintenance . The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
C.  No interference with public safety communication frequencies . The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
D.  Worker safety . The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
E.  Public safety . The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
F.  Design standards . The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. 
G.  Alternate placements . Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
H.  Height limitations . The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the lessor of: 
1.  Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
2.  Forty-five (45) feet above ground level. 
I.  Height exceptions or variances . If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in Chapter 17.70. 
J.  Contractual design requirements . The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
K.  Ground-mounted equipment spacing . The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
L.  Undergrounding regulations . The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
M.  Collocation completion deadline . Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

B.  It is unlawful to discharge wastewater to any public sanitary sewer except those wastewaters in compliance with standards promulgated pursuant to the Federal Act, or the State Act, or any rules, regulations, ordinances or standards of the Village. 
C.  There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits: for residential and commercial service, and for service to establishments producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his or her agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the Village. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the Director of Public Works or designee. A permit and inspection fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) for a residential or commercial building sewer permit shall be paid to the Village at the time the application is filed. The industry, as a condition of permit authorization, must provide information describing its wastewater constituents, characteristics, and type of activity. 
D.  A building sewer permit will be issued and a sewer connection shall be allowed only if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewerage works, including sewers, pump stations and wastewater treatment facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load. 
E.  All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The person installing the building sewer for the owner shall be a plumber or sewer contractor, and he or she shall indemnify the Village from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation. Before a building sewer permit is issued, the plumber or sewer contractor shall file with the Director of Community Development an indemnity bond in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), with corporate surety licenses to the business in the State. In addition thereto, the plumber or sewer contractor shall file with the Director of Community Development a certificate of insurance covering public liability insurance in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00)/three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for bodily injury and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) covering property damage. 
F.  A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except, where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. 
G.  Old building sewers may be used in connection with a new building only when they are found on examination and tested by the Director of Public Works or designee to meet all requirements of this chapter. 
H.  The building sewer shall be extra-heavy cast iron soil pipe and fitting conforming to CISPI Specifications HS-67 with compression-type rubber gasket joints conforming to ASTM Specification C564, or PVC plastic sewer pipe conforming to ASTM D3034, thickness classification SDR35, or other suitable materials approved by the Director of Public Works or designee. 
I.  The building sewer shall not be less than six (6) inches diameter size pipe installed at a minimum invert slope of 0.125 (one-eighth ( 1/8 )) inch per foot, or not less than four (4) inch diameter size pipe in length of not less than ten (10) feet installed at a minimum invert slope of 0.25 (one-fourth) inch per foot.

J.  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the Y branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is twelve (12) inches in diameter or less, and no property location Y branch is available, the owner shall, at his or her expense, install a Y branch in the public sewer at the location specified and installation approved by the Director of Public Works or designee. Where the public sewer is greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter, and no properly located Y branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about forty-five (45) degrees. A forty-five (45) degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection when approved by the Director of Public Works or designee. 
K.  The building sewer pipe shall be bedded on a layer of gravel or crushed stone conforming to ASTM No. 67 specifications, and shall have a minimum thickness of four (4) inches under the pipe barrel and two (2) inches under bells. It shall be carefully placed and compacted around the pipe to provide uniform support to the bottom quadrant. 
L.  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three (3) feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sewage carried by such drains shall be lifted by approved pumping devices and discharged to the building sewer. 
M.  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. 
N.  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Director of Community Development when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the Director of Public Works or designee. 
O.  All excavations for building sewer installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Village. Prior to any excavation, the plumber or sewer contractor shall notify all public and private utility companies.

CHAPTER 13.20. - POLLUTION CONTROL 

Sec. 13.20.010. - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose and policy. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works for the Village and enables the Village to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403). The objectives of this chapter are: 
1.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works that will interfere with its operation; 
2.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment works, inadequately treated, into receiving water, or otherwise be incompatible with the publicly owned treatment work; 
3.  To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public; 
4.  To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from the publicly owned treatment works; 
5.  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works; and 
6.  To enable the Village to comply with its national pollutant discharge elimination system permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other Federal or State laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is subject. 
This chapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment works. The chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

Sec. 13.20.020. - General sewer use requirements. 
A.  Prohibited discharge standards. 
1.  General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, State or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
2.  Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or wastewater: 
a.  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty (60) degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
b.  Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 9.0 or otherwise causing structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
c.  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference; 
d.  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
e.  Wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but no in case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit (forty (40) degrees Celsius); 
f.  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; 
g.  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
h.  Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the Director of Public Works or designee in accordance with Section 13.20.030(D); 
i.  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
j.  Wastewater which impacts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently impacts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the Village's NPDES permit; 
k.  Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations; 
l.  Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artisan well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the Director of Public Works or designee; 
m.  Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes; 
n.  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Director of Public Works or designee in a wastewater discharge permit; 
o.  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
p.  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
q.  Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in concentrations greater than one hundred (100) mg/l; or 
r.  Wastewater causing readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than one percent (1.0%) of the lower explosive limit of the meter. 
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
B.  National categorical pretreatment standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are incorporated. 
1.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director of Public Works or designee may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
2.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Director of Public Works or designee shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
3.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
4.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
C.  Local limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits: 
50 mg/l ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 N)

The limits set forth in this subsection apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The Director of Public Works or designee may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations of this subsection. 
D.  Village's right of revision. The Village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
E.  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Director of Public Works or designee may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
F.  Waiver. The Director of Public Works or designee may waive any portion of the local limits as established herein for the following pollutants BOD, TSS, COD, NH 3 N, and TDS. Application must be made describing the proposed discharge in detail. 
(Code 1981, § 13.20.020; Ord. No. 98-5-1, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 13.20.030. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
A.  Pretreatment facilities. The user shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section 13.20.020(A) within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the State, or the Director of Public Works or designee, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director of Public Works or designee for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director of Public Works or designee before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user for the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Village under the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Additional pretreatment measures. 
1.  Whenever deemed necessary, the Director of Public Works or designee may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  The Director of Public Works or designee may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
3.  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works or designee, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Director of Public Works or designee and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. 
4.  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
C.  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two (2) years the Director of Public Works or designee shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Director of Public Works or designee may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the Director of Public Works or designee may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
1.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
2.  Description of stored chemicals; 
3.  Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of Public Works or designee of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 13.20.060(F); and 
4.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
D.  Hauled wastewater. 
1.  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW as established by the Director of Public Works or designee. Such waste shall not violate Section 13.20.020 or any other requirements established by the Village. The Director of Public Works or designee may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
2.  The Director of Public Works or designee shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The Director of Public Works or designee may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The Director of Public Works or designee also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this chapter. 
3.  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the Director of Public Works or designee. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the Director of Public Works or designee. The Director of Public Works or designee may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The Director of Public Works or designee may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
4.  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industrial, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
(Code 1981, § 13.20.030; Ord. No. 98-5-1, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 13.20.040. - Wastewater discharge permit application. 
A.  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the Director of Public Works or designee, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within thirty (30) days of the request. The Director of Public Works or designee is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
B.  Wastewater discharge permit requirement. 
1.  No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the Director of Public Works or designee except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to Section 13.20.040(C) may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. 
2.  The Director of Public Works or designee may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
3.  Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subject the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in Sections 13.20.100 through 13.20.120.

2.  No increment referred to in Subsection B.1 of this section shall exceed nine (9) months; 
3.  The user shall submit a progress report to the Director of Public Works or designee no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
4.  In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the Director of Public Works or designee. 
C.  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Director of Public Works or designee a report containing the information described in Subsection A.2.d through f of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.20.040(F). 
D.  Periodic compliance reports. 
1.  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the Director of Public Works or designee but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.20.040(F). 
2.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
3.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Director of Public Works or designee, using the procedures prescribed in Subsection K of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
E.  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Director of Public Works or designee of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change. 
1.  The Director of Public Works or designee may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section 13.20.040(E). 
2.  The Director of Public Works or designee may issue a wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.20.040(G) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.20.050(D) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
3.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
F.  Reports of potential problems. 
1.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Director of Public Works or designee of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
2.  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the Director of Public Works or designee, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
3.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection F.1 of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
G.  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director of Public Works or designee as the Director of Public Works or designee may require. 
H.  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the Director of Public Works or designee within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director of Public Works or designee within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the Director of Public Works or designee monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the Director of Public Works or designee samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
I.  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
1.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Subsection E of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Subsections A, B, and D of this section. 
2.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection I.1 of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one (1) time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
3.  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Director of Public Works or designee, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
4.  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
5.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. 
J.  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
K.  Sample collection. 
1.  Except as indicated in Subsection K.2 of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Director of Public Works or designee may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
L.  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
M.  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all record of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user of the Village, or the user had been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director of Public Works or designee.

Sec. 13.20.100. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
A.  Notification of violation. When the Director of Public Works or designee finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works or designee may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Director of Public Works or designee. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Director of Public Works or designee to take action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
B.  Consent orders. The Director of Public Works or designee may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Subsections D and E of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
C.  Show cause hearing. The Director of Public Works or designee may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Director of Public Works or designee and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
D.  Compliance orders. When the Director of Public Works or designee finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works or designee may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
E.  Cease and desist orders. When the Director of Public Works or designee finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director of Public Works or designee may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
F.  Administrative fines. 
1.  When the Director of Public Works or designee finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works or designee may fine such user in an amount not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
2.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent (1%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
3.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Director of Public Works or designee to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within fourteen (14) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Director of Public Works or designee may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Director of Public Works or designee may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
4.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
G.  Emergency suspensions. The Director of Public Works or designee may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director of Public Works or designee may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
1.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director of Public Works or designee may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director of Public Works or designee may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works or designee that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Subsection H of this section are initiated against the user. 
2.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of Public Works or designee prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Subsection C or H of this section. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a public hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
H.  Terminations of discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section 13.20.050(F), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
1.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
2.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
3.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
4.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
5.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section 13.20.020. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 13.20.030 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director of Public Works or designee shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1981, § 13.20.100; Ord. No. 98-5-1, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 13.20.110. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
A.  Injunctive relief. When the Director of Public Works or designee finds that a user has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works or designee may petition the McHenry County Circuit Court through the Village's Attorney for issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Director of Public Works or designee may also seek other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
B.  Civil penalties. 
1.  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Village for a maximum of civil penalty of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
2.  The Director of Public Works or designee may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Village. 
3.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
4.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
C.  Criminal prosecution. 
1.  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per violation, per day. 
2.

Sec. 13.20.120. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
A.  Performance bonds. The Director of Public Works or designee may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the Village in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Director of Public Works or designee to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
B.  Liability insurance. The Director of Public Works or designee may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
C.  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
D.  Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Director of Public Works or designee.

(Code 1981, § 13.20.120; Ord. No. 98-5-1, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 13.20.130. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
A.  Upset. 
1.  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
2.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of Subsection (A)(3) of this section, are met. 
3.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of the upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the Director of Public Works or designee within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only if an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
6.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
B.  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 13.20.020(A)(1) or the specific prohibitions in Section 13.20.020(A)(2)(c) through (r) if it can be proved that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through interference and that either: 
1.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through interference; or 
2.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents form the user's prior discharge when the Village was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
C.  Bypass. 
1.  For the purpose of this section: 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of water streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
2.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C.3 and 4 of this section. 
3.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director of Public Works or designee, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
4.  A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public Works or designee of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of that bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrences of the bypass. The Director of Public Works or designee may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
5.  Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works or designee may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There was no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C.3 of this section. 
6.  The Director of Public Works or designee may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director of Public Works or designee determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in Subsection C.5 of this section.

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note- Prior ordinance history: Ord. Nos. 81-11-1, 90-3-14. 

Sec. 15.48.010. - Findings. 
    The Board of Trustees of the Village finds that: 
A.  Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain non-agricultural uses, including, but not limited to, the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and drainageways, and the creation of recreational facilities; 
B.  The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles; 
C.  Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys, washed-out fills and embankments; 
D.  Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs; 
E.  Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and 
F.  Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions, resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety. 
(Code 1981, § 15.48.010; Ord. No. 92-6-10, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 15.48.015. - Purpose. 
    The Board of Trustees declares that the purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the Village. It is the intention of this chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land disturbing activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state.

Sec. 15.48.030. - General principles. 
    It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities, including clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling of land, in the Village. Measures taken to control soil erosion and off-site sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten (10) year frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the Village and to the preparation of the submissions required under Section 15.48.040: 
A.  Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
B.  Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures. 
C.  Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation. 
D.  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development. 
E.  Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development. 
F.  The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and benefits involved. 
G.  In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered. 
H.  Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site or downstream. 
I.  Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development. 
J.  Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development. 
K.  All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be property disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water. 
L.  All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. 
(Code 1981, § 15.48.030; Ord. No. 92-6-10, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 15.48.040. - Site development permit.

It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to notify the permitting authority of any significant changes which occur in the site development schedule after the initial erosion and sediment control plan has been approved. 
b.  These submissions shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the standards and requirements contained in "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control" (the Yellow Book) published by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the "Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control" (the Green Book) prepared by the Northeastern Illinois Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Steering Committee and adopted by the McHenry County soil and water conservation district, which standards and requirements are incorporated into this chapter by reference. 
c.  The permitting authority may waive specific requirements for the content of submissions upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to show that the work will comply with the objectives and principles of this chapter. 
E.  Bonds. The applicant is required to file with the Village a faithful performance bond or bonds, letter of credit, or other improvement security satisfactory to the Village attorneys in an amount deemed sufficient by the permitting authority to cover all costs of improvements, landscaping, maintenance of improvements and landscaping, and soil erosion and sediment control measures for such period as specified by the Village, and engineering and inspection costs to cover the cost of failure or repair of improvements installed on the site. 
F.  Review and approval. Each application for a site development permit shall be reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures: 
1.  The permitting authority will review each application for a site development permit to determine its conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The permitting authority may also refer any application to the McHenry County Soil and Water Conservation District and/or any other local government or public agency within whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comment. Within thirty (30) days after receiving an application, the permitting authority shall, in writing: 
a.  Approve the permit application if it is found to be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, and issue the permit; 
b.  Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this chapter, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or 
c.  Disapprove the permit application, indicating the deficiencies and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission. 
2.  No site development permit shall be issued for an intended development site unless: 
a.  The development, including, but not limited to, subdivisions and planned unit development, has been approved by the Village where applicable; 
b.  Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building permit issued by the Village; or 
c.  The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall development program previously approved by the Village for the area in which the site is situated; and 
d.  All relevant Federal and State permits (i.e., for floodplains and wetlands) have been received for the portion of the subject to soil disturbance. 
3.  Failure of the permitting authority to act on an original or revised application within thirty (30) days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in accordance with the plans as filed unless such time is extended by agreement between the permitting authority and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a revised plan, development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance with conditions established by the permitting authority. 
G.  Expiration of permit. Every site development permit shall expire and become null and void if the work authorized by the such permit has not been commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days, or is not completed by a date which shall be specified in the permit; except that the permitting authority may, if the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of the permit. The permitting authority may require modification of the erosion control plan to prevent any increase in erosion or off-site sediment runoff resulting from any extension. 
H.  Appeals. The applicant, or any person or agency which received notice of the filing of the application, may appeal the decision of the permitting authority as provided in Subsection G of this section to the Village Board of Trustees. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Board of Appeals shall schedule and hold a public hearing, after giving fifteen (15) days' notice thereof. The Village Board of Trustees shall render a decision within thirty (30) days after the hearing. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but need not be limited to, the effects of the proposed development activities on the surface water flow to tributary and downstream lands, any comprehensive watershed management plans, or the use of any retention facilities; possible saturation of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainageways; nature and type of soil or rock which when disturbed by the proposed development activities may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape through grading or removal of vegetation. 
I.  Retention of plans. Plans, specifications, and reports for all site developments shall be retained in original form or on microfilm by the permitting authority. 
(Code 1981, § 15.48.040; Ord. No. 92-6-10, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 15.48.050. - Design and operation standards and requirements. 
A.  Applicability. All clearing, grading, stripping, excavating and filling which is subject to the permit requirements of this chapter shall be subject to the applicable standards and requirements set forth in Subsections C through G of this section, inclusive. 
B.  Responsibility. The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the Village or its officers or agents will not be liable for such damage, by: 
1.  The issuance of a permit under this chapter; 
2.  Compliance with the provisions of that permit or with conditions attached to it by the permitting authority; 
3.  Failure of Village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions; 
4.  Failure of Village officials to recommend denial of or to deny a permit; or 
5.  Exemptions from the permit requirements of this chapter. 
C.  Site design requirements. 
1.  On-site sediment control measures, as specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site: 
a.  For disturbed areas draining less than one (1) acre, filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed to control all off-site runoff as specified in referenced handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet, may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected. 
b.  For disturbed areas draining more than one (1) but less than five (5) acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
c.  For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
d.  Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for both detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage and each shall be sized for the two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour runoff from the site under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten (10) hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention storage. 
e.  The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one (1) year. For construction periods exceeding one (1) year, the one (1) year sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted. 
2.  Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales and diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the ten (10) year frequency storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized within forty-eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards: 
a.  For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with mulch, erosion blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel. 
b.  For grades of four (4%) to eight percent (8%), sod or an equivalent control measure shall be applied in the channel. 
c.  For grades greater than eight percent (8%), rock, rip-rap, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures. 
3.  Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within seven (7) calendar days following the end of active disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or nonvegetative measures. 
b.  Areas having slopes greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent. 
4.  Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met: 
a.  Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel. 
b.  The time and areas of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within forty-eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped. 
c.  Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted. 
5.  Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications. 
6.  Soil storage piles containing more than ten (10) cubic yards of material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than twenty-five (25) feet to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be installed immediately on the downslope side of the piles. 
7.  If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent. 
8.  Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. 
9.  All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of their intended function. 
10.  All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. 
D.  Handbooks adopted by reference. The standards and specifications contained in "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control" (the Yellow Book) and the "Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control" (the Green Book) cited in Section 15.48.040(D), are incorporated into this section and made a part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans approved under Section 15.48.040(D). In the event of conflict between provisions of said manuals and of this chapter, this chapter shall govern. 
E.  Maintenance of control measures. All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter shall be maintained periodically by the applicant or subsequent land owner during the period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance. 
F.  Inspection. 
1.  The permitting authority shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping, excavating and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the permitting authority shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections and to ensure compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, the grading or building permit, and this chapter, the permittee shall notify the permitting authority within two (2) working days of the completion of the construction stages specified below: 
a.  Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any other earth disturbance or grading; 
b.  After stripping and clearing; 
c.  After rough grading; 
d.  After final grading; 
e.  After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and 
f.  After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of sediment controls. 
2.  If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five (5) working days after notice is received by the Village from the permittee, the permittee may continue work at his own risk, without presuming acceptance by the Village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing at the site. 
G.  Special precautions. 
1.  If at any stage of the grading of any development site the permitting authority determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland or drainage structure, the permitting authority may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions to be taken as is considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for further work. 
2.  Where is appears that storm damage may result because the grading on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual sit conditions prevail, the permitting authority may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. 
3.  Amendment of plans. Major amendments of the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the permitting authority and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the permitting authority by written authorization to the permittee.

CHAPTER 16.28. - DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS AND SCHOOL SITES AS A REQUIREMENT FOR PLAT APPROVAL 

Sec. 16.28.005. - Findings and determinations. 
A.  Whereas, the Village has experienced a population increase due in part to the subdivision and planned unit development of vacant land within the jurisdiction of Cary; and 
B.  Whereas, such population growth might result in the rapid disappearance of available land and the marked increase in land values; and 
C.  Whereas, the Village has found that healthful, productive community life depends in part on the availability of recreational and park space and adequate school and fire protection facilities; and 
D.  Whereas, it is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety requires that a minimum of one acre of land for each one hundred (100) persons residing within the Village be devoted to park and recreational purposes; and 
E.  Whereas, it is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety requires the establishment of school sites within the Village in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  Four hundred (400) capacity elementary schools, kindergarten through fifth grade, on fifteen (15) acres of land, 
2.  Seven hundred fifty (750) capacity junior high school, grades sixth through eighth, on thirty-five (35) acres of land, 
3.  One thousand (1,000) capacity high schools, grades ninth through twelfth, on sixty (60) acres of land; and 
F.  Whereas, it is determined that the "Table of Estimated Ultimate Population," which is published by the Illinois School Consulting Service, is generally indicative of current and short-range projected trends of the number of school-age children and of adults to be generated from proposed subdivisions or planned unit developments; and 
G.  Whereas, it is determined that the present "fair market value" of such improved land in and surrounding the Village is at least one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) per acre; and 
H.  Whereas, it has been found and determined that the locations of park and recreational and school sites and provision for fire protection facilities to serve the immediate and future needs of residents and children of each new subdivision or planned unit development is just as essential to proper land development as are streets, water, sewer and sidewalks; and 
I.  Whereas, notwithstanding the foregoing finding relating to the fair market value of improved land, it is determined by the Village to require cash contributions substantially less than the amount which would otherwise be produced by a consideration of all of the aforesaid factors; and 
J.  It has been determined, and is declared, that it is urgent that the ordinance codified in this chapter take effect immediately upon its passage and approval. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.005; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part); Ord. No. O04-08-01, § I, 8-3-2004) 
Sec. 16.28.010. - Required. 
    As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the Village, in accordance with the criteria and formula set forth in Sections 16.28.020 through 16.28.240. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.010; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part)) 
ARTICLE I. - CRITERIA FOR PARK AND RECREATION LAND DEDICATION 

Sec. 16.28.020. - Requirement and population ratio. 
    The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be one (1) acre of land per one hundred (100) of ultimate population. This requirement shall not include land required for stormwater, drainage systems or retention/detention facilities. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated in this chapter, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.020; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 16.28.030. - Location. 
    The official map of the Village and/or "The Cary Park District Park and Recreation Facilities Plan" shall be used as a guideline in locating park sites. Each subdivider or his or her agent shall obtain a statement in writing from the park district and submit a copy thereof to the Village recommending: the exact size and location of each parcel to be used for park and recreation purposes; or the amount of cash to be paid in lieu thereof; or a combination of land and cash to be paid in lieu thereof; prior to consideration and approval of such park and recreational land dedication by the Village President and Board of Trustees. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.030; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 16.28.040. - Cash contribution in lieu of land dedication. 
    In the event the Cary Park District Board should determine that a cash contribution or a combination of land and cash contribution shall be made by the subdivider or developer in lieu of the required land dedication, the Village shall apply a formula as follows: the required land donation minus the land being dedicated divided the required donation, that fraction times the product of the total number of units multiplied by the appropriate scheduled rate from Section 16.28.130 yields the cash donation. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.040; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part)) 
ARTICLE II. - CRITERIA FOR SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION 

Sec. 16.28.050. - Requirement and population ratio. 
    The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: (1) estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the (2) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the (3) minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification. This requirement shall not include land required for stormwater, drainage systems or retention/detention facilities. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.050; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 16.28.060. - Classifications and size of site. 
    School classifications and size of school sites within the Village shall be determined in accordance with the criteria heretofore set forth in the recital portion of this chapter. The official map of the Village and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.060; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 16.28.070. - Density formula. 
A.  The current "Table of Estimated Ultimate Population" per dwelling unit of population density, which is published by the Illinois School Consulting Service, shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land and any combination of land dedication and cash contribution. For purposes of this section, the current table shall mean the most recent table of estimated ultimate tabulation per dwelling unit published by the Illinois School Consulting Service as applied simultaneously with the request for approval of the final plat of subdivision or planned unit development pursuant to the ordinances of the Village. 
B.  In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the "Table of Estimated Ultimate Population" listed herein, he or she shall submit his or her own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the Village Board of Trustees based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board of Trustees by the park district, school district, or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated in this chapter, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.

Secs. 16.28.080-16.28.100. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - CRITERIA FOR CASH CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION 

Sec. 16.28.110. - Required. 
    Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is otherwise inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site, the Village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. Cash in lieu of the required park land contribution shall be computed as per the schedule in Section 16.28.130. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.110; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 16.28.120. - Fair market value. 
    The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation and school sites. It has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in the planning jurisdiction of the Village is one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) per acre, and such figure may be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection, the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of his or her development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the Village Board of Trustees based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board of Trustees by the park district, school district, or others. 
(Code 1981, § 16.28.120; Ord. No. 98-7-3, § 1(part); Ord. No. O04-08-01, § II, 8-3-2004) 
Sec. 16.28.130. - Schedule. 
A.  The cash contribution per each residential dwelling unit for library district, fire protection district facilities, and for park and school purposes where the Village requires solely cash in lieu of land dedication for school and park sites, shall be in accordance with the schedule in Table 16.28.130.

Editor's note- The provisions of the subdivision ordinance of March 3, 1964, formerly set out in Sections 17.32.010-17.32.060 of Ch. 17.32, were entirely amended by Section 22 of Ord. No. 82-12-1. 

Sec. 16.32.010. - Installation of subdivision improvements prior to final plat approval. 
    A subdivider shall have the option to construct required subdivision improvements prior to the approval of the final plat, after both the preliminary plat and plans and specifications have been approved by the President and Board of Trustees. In such case, the subdivider shall, within two (2) years after the date of such approval (unless good cause can be shown to the President and Board of Trustees for granting an extension of time), construct and install such required improvements in accordance with the approved preliminary plat and plans and specifications. When the subdivider has completed all of the required improvements and has complied with all of the conditions and requirements of this title relating to the acceptance of the required subdivision improvements by the Village, and has filed the guarantee bond described in Section 16.32.060, the final plat will be approved by the President and Board of Trustees.

    A final plat of subdivision may be approved by the President and Board of Trustees prior to the construction and installation of required subdivision improvements; provided, however, that such final plat shall not be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds until the subdivider has posted with the Village Clerk security in the amount of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost of the required improvements as itemized in writing by the subdivider's engineer and as approved by the Village Engineer. The itemized cost of improvements shall be accompanied by photocopies of all contracts relating to the required improvements that have been entered into by the subdivider. However, where any such contracts are entered into after a final plat has been approved by the President and Board of Trustees, photocopies of such subsequent contracts shall be immediately provided by the subdivider to the Village, whereupon the dollar amount of the security previously accepted by the Village may be reviewed and increased or decreased by the President and Board of Trustees to reflect any difference between the actual costs of construction as shown by such contracts and the costs previously itemized to the Village by the subdivider's engineer. Any increase in the dollar amount of the construction guarantee ordered by the President and Board of Trustees shall be posted by the subdivider with the Village Clerk immediately.

B.  Upon application of the subdivider, the Village may, in its sole discretion, extend the initial two (2) year completion date aforesaid, upon such terms and conditions as the Village President and Board of Trustees deem appropriate. 
C.  Where the required improvements have not been installed either within the time required, including extensions granted, if any, or in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, the Village may draw against the security for use in matters relating to insuring the satisfactory construction of said improvements, including attorney's fees, engineering and consulting fees and court costs, if any, incurred in connection with the enforcement of the provisions of this title. 
(Code 1981, § 16.32.030; Ord. No. 82-12-1, § 1(22)(part); Ord. No. 00-4-5, §§ 8, 9(part)) 
Sec. 16.32.040. - Reduction or release of security. 
    The security may be reduced or released by the President and Board of Trustees upon subdivider's prior compliance with each of the following requirements: 
A.  A written application shall be made by subdivider to the President and Board of Trustees for a reduction, release or payout in such amount that guarantee funds remaining in the security will always equal one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost to construct the uncompleted work, as determined by the President and Board of Trustees after consultation with the Village Engineer. 
B.  The aforesaid written application shall be supported by the Village Engineer's statement that he or she has regularly inspected the improvements made during the progress of the construction and that to the best of his or her knowledge from these inspections the improvements have been constructed and installed in conformance with the approved plans and specifications and in accordance with good engineering and construction practice. 
C.  The subdivider shall provide the Village with the record drawings elsewhere described in this chapter. 
D.  The subdivider shall provide the Village with the guarantee bond elsewhere described in this chapter. 
E.  The dollar amount of the security may be reduced only once where the initial dollar amount thereof is five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) or less, and only twice where the initial dollar amount thereof is more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00). 
F.  No reduction in or release of the security on file with the Village shall be allowed unless and until the subdivider, property owner, and property governed by the security is/are in full compliance with all Village ordinances.

A.  Prior to the reduction or release of any security the owner or subdivider shall file with the Village Clerk a guarantee bond, running to the Village, in a penal sum equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the estimated cost of all land improvements to be released from the subdivision bond or other subdivision surety required by this title, guaranteeing the Village against defective materials and work in said land improvements for a period of twelve (12) months after the owner's or subdivider's security has been released in full by the Board of Trustees. The guarantee bond shall be approved as to form and substance by the Village Attorney. 
B.  The Board of Trustees shall release the guarantee bond to the owner or subdivider aforesaid after the expiration of the guarantee period upon receipt of the written report of the Village Engineer to the President and Board of Trustees certifying that the materials and work guaranteed by said guarantee bond are free from defect and may be finally accepted by the Village. 
C.  The acceptance of any streets or other land improvement by the Board of Trustees in connection with any reduction in the amount of security shall be construed as a tentative acceptance thereof only, and not as a waiver of any of the provisions of this section. Final acceptance of the street and other land improvements can occur only when the guarantee bond is released by formal resolution of the President and Board of Trustees. However, the normal operation costs of the pumping stations, streetlights, snow plowing, street sweeping, etc., shall be assumed by the Village when put in operation upon being tentatively accepted subject to the guarantee.

Sec. 17.10.042. - Conflict. 
    Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this title upon the use of land, buildings or structures, or upon the bulk of buildings or structures are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of this title or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive, or which impose higher standards or requirements, shall govern. 
(Code 1981, § 17.10.042; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.10.043. - Conflict with easements.

(Code 1981, § 17.10.082; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.10.083. - Structures to be located on lots; limit of number of principal buildings.

Sec. 17.10.091. - Every lot must abut a street. 
    No new use or structure, other than one related to agriculture or park uses, or for attached single-family residential dwellings or planned development, shall be permitted on a lot in the Village which does not abut a dedicated and accepted public street. 
(Code 1981, § 17.10.091; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.10.092. - Building in floodplain. 
    No new building, or alteration or enlargement of an existing building shall hereafter be erected except in conformity with the flood control ordinance (see Chapter 15.40). 
(Code 1981, § 17.10.092; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
ARTICLE VII. - DISTRICT BOUNDARIES 

Sec. 17.10.101. - General. 
    The boundaries of each zoning district are established as shown on the official zoning map of the Village of Cary. In the event that map conflicts with the ordinance establishing the zoning for that tract, then the ordinance controls. Whenever uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts shown on the map, the following guidelines shall apply. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, utility easements, railroad lines, streams, property lines, or the Village limits shall be construed as following such lines. Where the boundaries appear to follow two (2) or more of the above features, the boundary shall be construed to favor the interpretation that resolves the issue in the context of the broader area. 
(Code 1981, § 17.10.101; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.10.102. - Divided lots. 
    Where a boundary divides a lot or tract one-half (1/2) acre or less in size, the lot shall be construed to lie entirely within the zoning district in which the majority of the lot resides. Where a district boundary divides any lot greater than one-half (1/2) acre, each part of the lot so divided shall be developed consistent with the regulations of the district in which it lies. 
(Code 1981, § 17.10.102; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.10.103. - Fractional requirements. 
    When a requirement of this title, other than that determining density, results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall be considered a whole unit, and a fraction of less than one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded. In determining density, any fraction shall be disregarded. 
(Code 1981, § 17.10.103; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.10.104. - Automatic classification of certain annexed territory. 
A.  When territory is annexed to the Village and the zoning classification thereof is not established pursuant to the terms of an annexation agreement, such territory shall be automatically zoned to the most restrictive district consistent with the size of the lots. Thus, lots will be zoned consistent with the following table: 
Lot Area (square feet) District Less than 15,000 R2 15,000 to 17,999 R1A 18,000 to 43,559 R1 More than 43,559 E1  
B.  Any lots which cannot meet the use or dimensional requirements for the district shall be accorded nonconforming status, and may continue to exist, or must abate consistent with Chapter 17.60. 
(Code 1981, § 17.10.104; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
CHAPTER 17.20. - DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 17.20.010. - Establishment of zoning districts. 
    For purpose of this title, the Village is divided into the following districts: 
A.  E1: Very low density single-family residential district.

L.  M: Limited manufacturing district. 
M.  A-1: Agricultural district. 
N.  PO-1: Park and open space district 1. 
O.  PO-2: Park and open space district 2. 
P.  PO-3: Park and open space district 3. 
Q.  PO-4: Park and open space district 4. 
(Code 1981, § 17.20.010; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-07, § 1, 8-19-2003; Ord. No. O08-02-08, § 2, 2-19-2008; Ord. No. O11-04-03, § 2, 4-26-2011) 
ARTICLE I. - PURPOSES OF THE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 17.20.021. - Single-family residential (EL, R1, R1A, R2) districts. 
    The single-family residential districts are designed to accommodate single-family detached residential uses, other than mobile homes, on lots or parcels having different dimensional requirements. These districts may also accommodate some institutional uses which directly serve the single-family residential community and which provide it with a sense of neighborhood, such as schools and churches. 
(Code 1981, § 17.20.021; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.20.022. - Multifamily residential (R3) district. 
    The multifamily residential district is intended to accommodate multifamily and single-family attached residential uses. It also may accommodate some other moderately intensive uses that can be sited without posing an adverse impact on the multifamily and single-family attached residential uses. It also may accommodate some group homes and care facilities which need a stable residential area in order to foster the adjustment of persons back into the community. It allows a broader range of institutional uses than would be allowed in the single-family residential districts. 
(Code 1981, § 17.20.022; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.20.023. - Business (B1, B2, B3, B3R, B4, BP) districts. 
    The purpose of the business districts is to accommodate a range of commercial activities. 
A.  The B1 district is designed to accommodate the needs of the existing central business district with a broad range of office and retail uses, substantial limitations on storage uses, and some incentives for multifamily residential use. The district recognizes the zero lot line nature of past development. It makes allowances for residential redevelopment of stories above the ground floor. It recognizes the importance of the architectural elements in contributing to the ambience and health of the district. 
B.  The B2 district is designed to accommodate general retail and selected service uses in shopping centers. These districts are intended to be nodal in nature. These areas should be greater than twenty-five (25) acres in size, and located at the intersection of arterials, or arterials and collectors. They are not intended for development on small tracts adjacent to and along arterials. 
C.  The B3 district is designed to accommodate general retail and service uses along major arterials. The district is intended to serve as a transition between major highways, such as U.S. 14, and single-family residential uses. These districts should be located along selected major arterials, particularly those where some general retail and service uses have already occurred, and where the use of the district would encourage an infill of those commercial uses. The district provides for adaptive reuse of structures formerly in residential use, and the development of vacant parcels that are too small for shopping centers. The district is also intended to serve as a transition between the central business district and the single-family residential uses. Because of these transitional functions, it is viewed as a fringe district. The B3 district recognizes that some strip commercial development may be appropriate. 
D.  The B3R district is designed to further the purposes of the B3 district. In addition, it recognizes that this area has some particularly attractive architectural features which should be retained, that redevelopment and changing uses in the area might pose a greater impact on the surrounding residential area because of its close proximity and for that reason the range of permitted uses needs to be narrower, and that single-family residential uses currently exist and are encouraged to remain. 
E.  The B4 district is designed to address neighborhood (as opposed to community) commercial needs. The B4 districts should be located on arterials and at an appropriate distance from other commercial districts, so as to discourage future strip commercial development between the districts. B4 nodes should be limited to less than five (5) acres. 
F.  The BP district is designed to address the needs for office, research and light industrial uses in a business park setting. 
(Code 1981, § 17.20.023; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-07, § 1, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.20.024. - Manufacturing (M) district. 
    The purpose of the manufacturing district is to accommodate a range of industrial, institutional, wholesale and storage needs. It may also accommodate some "difficult to site" uses that are needed in the community. Industrial uses must meet performance standards. 
(Code 1981, § 17.20.024; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.20.025. - Agricultural (A-1) district. 
    The agricultural (A-1) district is designed to accommodate agricultural, forestry, passive recreation, parks and mining and mineral extraction uses. 
Sec. 17.20.026. - Park and open space district 1 (PO-1). 
    The park and open space district 1 is established to distinguish lands owned or maintained by the Village or Cary Park District that provide limited recreational and open space use for neighborhood residents generally located within easy walking distance of residential areas, and are generally under one acre in size. The PO-1 district protects open space and linear greenway space for public recreational use, and other ancillary or accessory uses, and eliminates the ambiguity of maintaining park lands and facilities in unrelated use districts. The PO-1 district does not allow indoor recreational uses. 
(Ord. No. O11-04-03, § 2, 4-26-2011) 
Sec. 17.20.027. - Park and open space district 2 (PO-2). 
    The park and open space district 2 is established to distinguish lands owned or maintained by the Village or Cary Park District that provide limited recreational and open space needs of the Village, and which serve as the recreational and social focus of a larger neighborhood area generally located within moderate walking distance of residential areas. The PO-2 district protects open space and linear greenway space for a limited range of active and passive public recreational uses, including playgrounds, athletic courts, natural areas, and other ancillary or accessory uses, and eliminates the ambiguity of maintaining park lands and facilities in unrelated use districts. The PO-2 district does not allow indoor recreational uses.

Sec. 17.20.028. - Park and open space district 3 (PO-3). 
    The park and open space district 3 is established to distinguish lands owned or maintained by the Village or Cary Park District that provide for a wide range of recreational, conservation and open space needs of the Village, and which serve to provide community-based recreation needs, as well as preserving unique landscapes, natural areas and open spaces. The PO-3 district protects open space for a wide range of active and passive public outdoor recreational uses, including limited indoor uses (as allowed with the granting of a conditional use permit by the Village Board) and other ancillary or accessory uses, and eliminates the ambiguity of maintaining park lands and facilities in unrelated use districts. 
(Ord. No. O11-04-03, § 2, 4-26-2011) 
Sec. 17.20.029. - Park and open space district 4 (PO-4). 
    The park and open space district 4 is established for parks and open spaces over 50 acres in size, and is intended to distinguish lands owned or maintained by the Village or Cary Park District that provide for a wide range of recreational, conservation and open space needs of the Village. These parks serve both community and regional-based recreation needs, as well as preserving unique landscapes, natural areas and open spaces. The PO-4 district protects open space for a wide range of active and passive public outdoor and indoor recreational uses, and other ancillary or accessory uses, and eliminates the ambiguity of maintaining park lands and facilities in unrelated use districts. 
(Ord. No. O11-04-03, § 2, 4-26-2011) 
Sec. 17.20.030. - Table of permitted uses. 
    The following uses shall be permitted in the applicable districts as indicated in the table of permitted uses, found at the end of this section (Table 17.23). Except as provided below, uses which are marked by an "X" in the table shall be allowed with a zoning permit; uses which are marked by a "C" in the table shall be allowed with a conditional use permit. Uses not marked by either an "X" or "C" in the table are not permitted. Uses not permitted are prohibited. 
A.  Intensive uses require a conditional use permit. In the event that a use indicated as allowable with a zoning permit (marked by an "X" in the table) will generate more than one thousand five hundred (1,500) motor vehicle trips on a typical (average) day, the use will require a conditional permit. For purpose of determining the number of trips generated to and from the site, the permit issuing authority shall consult the most recent edition of the "Trip Generation Manual" prepared by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
B.  Uses not listed. In the event that a use is proposed that is not listed in the table, the Director of Community Development shall determine if the use is the same or similar to a use listed in the table. If it is, he or she shall treat the use in the same manner as the "similar" use. If not, he or she shall treat the use as not permitted. 
C.  More than one use on a lot. Where a single business entity proposes to or is engaged in more than one (1) principal use on a lot, or where two (2) or more uses are located on one (1) lot, each use must be a permitted use in the district in which it is located.

Sec. 17.20.040. - Table of dimensional standards. 
    The following table, known as the "Table of Dimensional Standards," addresses the dimensional requirements (also known as the bulk standards) applicable to the development or use of a lot in a given district. These standards must be read in conjunction with the supplemental standards in Chapter 17.50, regulating specific uses. Where there is a conflict between the two (2) standards, unless the supplemental standard specifically provides otherwise, the more restrictive standard applies. The permit issuing authority may allow the minimum front, side or rear setbacks to be reduced by up to twenty percent (20%) where he, she or it finds that any use established as a result of the deviation is unlikely to pose a significant adverse impact on the lots adjacent to the yard that is subject to the deviation. In interpreting this table, the column headings shall be interpreted as follows: 
A.  Lot area. The minimum area in square feet which a lot is required to have. 
B.  Lot width. The minimum width in feet as measured at the front setback line which a lot is required to have. 

C.  Lot depth. The minimum recommended distance in feet from the middle of the front property line (the line between the front yard and the right-of-way) to the middle of the rear property line. 6 
D.  Front setback. The minimum distance in feet that a structure must be set back from the street property line at the front of the property. Where a lot borders two (2) or more streets, the front of the lot shall be determined consistent with the criteria set out in the definition for "Lot, front of," in Chapter 17.90. 
E.  Side setback adjacent to street. The minimum distance in feet that a structure must be set back from the side property line adjacent to a street. 
F.  Interior side setback. The minimum distance in feet that a structure must be set back from a lot line other than a front, rear, or side lot line adjacent to a street. 
G.  Rear setback. The minimum distance in feet that a structure must be set back from the rear property line. 
H.  Net residential density. The maximum density, as expressed in the number of dwelling units per acre, that may be constructed on the developable portion of a parcel of land. The developable portion of a parcel of land shall not include submerged lands, wetlands, flood hazard areas, streets, or stormwater drainage ponds or basins. 
I.  Coverage. The maximum percentage of the area of the lot that can be placed in developmental uses. Areas in developmental uses include the ground floor area of buildings and accessory structures, vehicle accommodation areas, and other uses with impervious surfaces, including, but not limited to, driveways, sidewalks, patios and decks. 
J.  Height. The maximum height in feet of that part of the structure that faces the street as measured in a manner consistent with the definition of "Building, height of," in Chapter 17.90. 
K.  Ground floor area. The minimum floor area on the ground floor in the principal building expressed in square feet.

CHAPTER 17.30. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 17.30.010. - General. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any new use, any substantial addition to an existing use, or any substantial change in use, other than a detached single-family or two (2) family residential use, shall meet the standards set out in this chapter. For purpose of this chapter, a substantial addition is an addition of two thousand (2,000) square feet or more of nonresidential building floor space and an increase of at least thirty-three percent (33%) in the gross floor area of the nonresidential buildings on the lot, or the addition of more than three (3) residential dwelling units. A substantial change in use is one that results in an increase of more than one hundred fifty (150) motor vehicle trips generated to and from the site. For purpose of measuring the increase, the developer shall use the most recent version of the "Trip Generation Manual" prepared by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and compare the number of trips that should have occurred to and from the site at the time when the permit was requested with what is forecasted to occur if the proposal is implemented. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.010; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
ARTICLE I. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 17.30.021. - Standards for driveways not accessing State highways. 
A.  Standards related to location. Intensive uses, including, but not limited to, grocery stores with gas sales (convenience stores), restaurants with drive-in windows, automobile service stations, theaters, and shopping centers, are required: 
1.  To have direct access to a street designated as an arterial or collector in the comprehensive plan, or designed to arterial or collector standards; or 
2.  To have indirect access to the above by way of a local street without traffic generated from the site having to pass in front of lots in residential use. 
B.  Standards related to turning movements. Any new development, any substantial addition to an existing use or any substantial change in use shall provide turn lanes and other safety measures that are necessary to ensure the safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians on and near the site, including adjacent streets. 
C.  Standards related to ingress and egress. Any new development, any substantial addition to an existing use or any substantial change in use shall meet the following standards: 
1.  Points of ingress and egress shall be limited in width to thirty-five (35) feet except that a width not to exceed fifty (50) feet may be permitted where the permit issuing authority determines that additional width is desirable because of the size, shape, topography of the lot, or the location of the structures on the lot, or where a substantial number of tractor trailer trips are anticipated. 
2.  Vehicle movement to and from the site shall be clearly channeled through points of ingress and egress by way of curbing, pavement painting and other techniques and devices. In general, barriers shall be preferred over painting. 
3.  Points of ingress and egress shall be limited to two (2) per site and one (1) per street, except that the permit issuing authority may allow an additional point of ingress and egress if it will not pose a safety hazard; provided that: 
a.  The lot has a lot width of greater than two hundred (200) feet; or 
b.  The site borders two (2) or more streets, and each street will have at least one (1) point of ingress or egress. In determining if a point of ingress or egress will not pose a safety hazard, the authority will consider the number of trips generated by the use, the number of trips on the street, the number of conflicting turning movements, the number of lanes and configuration of the street, the location of points of ingress and egress, and any safety measures proposed by the developer. 
4.  Except where the entire proposed or existing point of ingress or egress is located or proposed to be located more than one hundred (100) feet from the intersection, any point of ingress and egress shall be located as far as practical from the end of radius of any street intersection. Every point of ingress and egress shall be separated from any other point of ingress or egress by at least one hundred (100) feet, as measured from the center of each. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.021; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.30.022. - Standards for driveways accessing State highways. 
    Any new development, any substantial addition to an existing use or any substantial change in use which proposes to add a new point of access, ingress or egress, or substantially modify an existing point of access, ingress or egress to a State or Federally maintained street or highway is required to comply with the standards in "Access to State Highways" published by the Illinois Department of Transportation (May 1990) as amended. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.022; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.30.030. - Streets, water and sewer, lighting. 
    Any new development, any substantial addition to an existing use or any substantial change in use will comply with the standards for land improvements set out in Chapter 16.40, Land Improvements. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.030; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.30.040. - Stormwater detention and erosion control. 
    Any new development, any substantial addition to an existing use or any substantial change in use will comply with the standards for stormwater management and erosion control set out in Chapter 15.38, Stormwater Detention, and Chapter 15.48, Soil and Erosion Control. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.040; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.30.050. - Floodplain and wetlands. 
    Any new development, any substantial addition to an existing use or any substantial change in use will comply with the standards for preventing flood hazards and the protection of wetland areas set out in Chapter 15.40, Flood Control Regulations. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.050; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
ARTICLE II. - DESIGN STANDARDS-LANDSCAPING 

Sec. 17.30.061. - Intent and standards. 
    It is the intent of this title to foster the creation of tree-lined streets and shaded vehicle accommodation areas, the screening of more intensive uses from less intensive uses, and, to the greatest extent practical, the retention of existing trees. It is the Village's intent that the standards in this section through Section 17.30.069 are to be flexibly administered. To that end, the permit issuing authority is authorized to allow modest deviations from one or more of the standards where other standards will be exceeded, provided the resulting overall landscaping plan is consistent with the intent of this article. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.061; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.30.062. - Tree-lined streets and shaded vehicle accommodation area standards. 
    Any new use, including detached single-family and two (2) family residential dwellings, or any substantial addition or substantial change to an existing use, shall comply with the following standards: 
A.  Street trees. One large shade tree shall be planted or retained for each forty (40) linear feet along every property line adjacent to a street. At least two (2) large shade trees shall be planted or retained for each lot. 
B.  Shade trees and screening for vehicle accommodation areas. One (1) large shade tree and two (2) shrubs shall be planted or retained for each seven and one-half (71/2) parking spaces in every vehicle accommodation area. Furthermore, one (1) large shade tree shall be planted or retained for each forty (40) linear feet in excess of forty (40) linear feet along each side of every driveway in a vehicle accommodation area, except those accessory to a detached single-family or two (2) family residential use. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.062; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.30.063. - Tree specifications. 
A.  Tree size. A large shade tree is a deciduous tree that at maturity is expected to reach at least forty (40) feet in height. Large shade trees shall be at least twelve (12) feet in height and two and one-half (21/2) inches in diameter (measured at one-half (1/2) foot above the ground) at time of planting. A large screening tree is a coniferous tree that at maturity is expected to reach at least thirty (30) feet in height. A large coniferous tree shall be at least eight (8) feet in height at time of planting. 
B.  Types of trees. The developer shall select trees that are suitable for this area of the State, considering the specific location in which they will be planted. The factors to consider in selecting trees should include useful range, tolerance to drought, form (absence of low branches), susceptibility to diseases, insects and pests, hazards to persons or infrastructure (thorns, roots prone to invading sewer lines), and longevity. The trees set out in the "Table of Recommended Shade Trees" are presumed to meet the standards of this section. This list was based on the pamphlet entitled "Selecting and Planting Trees," prepared by the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois in 1992. Because some of the trees on this list may be susceptible to minor disease or storm damage, the developer should consult the list to ensure that not more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the trees plants are known to be susceptible to these problems. In any event, the developer shall plant a variety of trees and shrubs. Not more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the proposed trees shall be of the same species. 
C.  Substitutions. In meeting the requirements of Section 17.30.062, the developer may substitute two (2) small shade trees as street trees for one (1) large shade tree, or one (1) large shade tree or two (2) small shade trees for one (1) large coniferous tree, or two (2) small coniferous trees for one (1) large coniferous tree. Any tree substituted for another shall be suitable for the intended use (i.e., where two (2) small shade trees are substituted for a large shade tree for use as a street tree, the small shade trees will be suitable for that use). Substitutions are not allowed to satisfy the requirements of the screening requirements. 
D.  Location. 
1.  Any trees planted to meet the tree-lined street or tree-lined driveway standard shall be planted at least three (3) feet but not more than twenty (20) feet from the edge of pavement of the street or driveway. Any trees or shrubs planted to meet the shading standard for parking areas shall be located within eight (8) feet of the perimeter of the vehicle accommodation area and be within a landscape area with a minimum of one hundred (100) square feet. The landscape area shall consist of topsoil with a surface of grass or mulch. Topsoil shall be a minimum of six (6) inches in depth. Any mulched areas will have a minimum depth of three (3) inches. 
2.  In the event that any required planting would significantly interfere with the safe sight distance needed for motorists entering or leaving the site, the permit issuing authority may require a specific type of tree be planted which would not interfere, or he or she may allow the planting to be moved to an alternate location consistent with the goals of this section. 
E.  Quality of stock and planting. All trees shall meet the standards set out in Chapter 12.20, Trees and Shrubs. All trees shall be grown in a nursery located within one hundred fifty (150) miles of the Village. The grade of all planting stock shall be in conformance with the most recently adopted edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Park grade trees shall not be allowed. All trees shall be balled and burlapped. All trees selected shall be healthy and free of insects and diseases, bark bruises and scrapes on the trunks or limbs before and after planting. Each tree selected shall be consistent in form and character with the species. Trees, other than those to be used for screening, shall have a straight trunk with limbs not lower than six (6) feet above the ground. 
F.  Continuing obligation and guarantee. Any trees or shrubs which are an integral and substantial part of a site plan submitted in support or furtherance of a permit issued under this title, and which die or are removed will need to be replaced by the developer. The developer shall replace any tree or shrub planted pursuant to this title that dies or falls into poor condition for a period of at least one (1) year from date of planting or the date the permit was issued, whichever is longer.

Sec. 17.30.065. - Retention of existing trees. 
    The developer shall retain seventy percent (70%) of the existing key trees whose width is twelve (12) inches or greater, and sixty percent (60%) of existing key trees whose width is six (6) inches or greater, measured four and one-half (41/2) feet above the ground, which lie within a cluster of trees. In order to accomplish the above, the developer shall submit a survey showing the location of trees that meet the above requirement. Clusters of trees six (6) inches or greater in width may be indicated by noting the perimeter of the area and the type and caliper of trees included therein. A cluster of trees shall consist of a group of three (3) or more qualifying trees. Where the number of trees meeting the requirement would be so extensive as to pose an unfair burden on the developer, the permit issuing authority may allow the developer to reduce the survey to only those trees within forty (40) feet of a proposed street. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.065; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.30.066. - Design standards-Screening. 
A.  Whenever a new use, or a substantial addition or substantial change to an existing use is proposed or occurs, such use, if it is more intensive than an adjacent property's use, shall create a screen between the structural uses on that lot and those of the adjacent lot(s). For purpose of applying this standard, the table of permitted uses is grouped by visual impact into screening classes, Class I through V, with Class I uses having the least impact. In addition, the type of screen required is divided into two (2) types, a Type A and Type B screen, whose standards are set out below. Finally, a table of screening is created which specifies when and what type of screen is required. 
B.  The screening class of accessory uses is the same as the principal use. However, trash receptacle areas, other than one serving an individual residential dwelling unit, areas used for outside storage, and other similar accessory uses shall be treated as a Class V use or structure. 
C.  For purpose of interpreting this section, where the adjacent land is not developed, the use on that lot shall be assumed to be the use which is most likely to occur on the property given its existing zoning, and the placement of the structures on the lot shall be those which seem the most reasonable. Any plantings shall comply with Sections 17.30.061 through 17.30.065. The type of trees allowed are enlarged to include the "Table of Recommended Screening Trees" set out in Section 17.30.069. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.066; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part))

Sec. 17.30.068. - Screening. 
    For purpose of this article, the types of screens are set out as follows: 
A.  Type A screen. A Type A screen is a semi-opaque to opaque barrier blocking the line of sight between the structures on the proposed tract and those on the adjacent tracts to a height of five (5) feet at the property line, and a broken barrier which breaks the line of sight between the structure on the proposed tract and those of the adjacent tract to a height of fifteen (15) feet at the property line. The screen shall consist, at a minimum, of one (1) of the following: 
1.  A landscape berm with fluctuating heights varying between three (3) and six (6) feet and fully landscaped with shrubs and small shade trees: 
a.  Two (2) staggered rows of large street trees, planted at forty (40) foot intervals; the rows planted at least fifteen (15) feet from each other; 
b.  A tall hedge of shrubs and a row of small shade trees planted at twenty (20) foot intervals; 
c.  A brick wall or wood fence and a row of small shade trees planted at twenty (20) foot intervals; 
d.  One (1) row of large screening trees planted at thirty (30) foot intervals; or 
e.  Two (2) staggered rows of small screening trees planted at thirty (30) foot intervals; the rows planted at least ten (10) feet from each other. 

B.  Type B screen. A Type B screen is a broken to semi-opaque barrier which breaks up the line of sight between the structures on the proposed tract and those on the adjacent tracts to a height of six (6) feet at the property line. The screen shall consist, at a minimum, of one (1) of the following: 
1.  A Type A screen as set out above; 
2.  One row of large shade trees planted at forty (40) foot intervals; or 
 
3.  Two rows of small trees planted at forty (40) foot intervals. 
This article distinguishes between screening trees and trees generally. Trees that are not screening trees may be used for screening but they are usually limited to a broken barrier. Screening trees are associated with a semi-opaque to opaque sight barrier. Where a hedge of shrubs is selected, the distance between the shrubs should be that recommended by the nursery and is the distance at which one (1) specimen will grow into the adjacent one when at maturity. 
C.  Type C screen. A Type C Screen is a semi-opaque to opaque barrier blocking the line of sight between structures on the proposed tract and those on the adjacent tracts to a height of five (5) feet at the property line. The screen shall consist, at a minimum, of one of the following: 
1.  A tall hedge of shrubs; 
2.  A brick wall or wood fence; or 
3.  A row of small screening trees. 
D.  Screening table. Every proposed use shall provide screening from an adjacent existing use or vacant lot in accordance with the following table. The classification of uses for screening purposes is set out in Section 17.30.067.

ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS-ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS 

Sec. 17.30.071. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this article not to restrict imagination, innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles which can result in creative solutions that will develop an attractive appearance within the Village, preserve taxable values, and promote the public health, safety and welfare. In general, the standards in this article seek to foster greater harmony between intensive development and the single-family residential community. However, the standards are not solely directed at nonresidential or multifamily residential uses. Some of the standards seek to foster harmony between any development and existing residential structures in the B3R district-a district characterized by some of the oldest housing in the Village. Furthermore, they seek to ensure that the character of that district will be retained. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.071; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-07, § 4, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.30.072. - General standards-Nonresidential developments. 
    Any new structure or any substantial change to the front facade of a building in nonresidential use or in a residential use, other than a detached single-family or two (2) family residential dwelling unit, or an accessory structure to those uses, shall demonstrate that the structure or proposed change to it will be attractive and compatible with the style and design of other structures on the lot, as well as structures and open spaces on adjacent properties and those across the street from it. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.072; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-07, § 4, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.30.073. - General standards-Any development in the B3R district. 
    Any new structures, and any substantial new addition to an existing structure in the B3R district shall be constructed or reconstructed in a manner consistent with single-family houses built in Cary between 1890 and 1940. Any new construction or reconstruction will meet the standards set out in Section 17.30.076. In addition, if any new construction or reconstruction is made to the front facade, the entire front facade and not just that which is being reconstructed or renovated shall meet those same standards. 
(Ord. No. O03-08-07, § 4, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.30.074. - Criteria. 
    In implementing the standards set out in Section 17.30.072 and 17.30.073 above, the permit issuing authority shall consider the following criteria: 
A.  Buildings and structures should be designed with an appropriate scale and exhibit a multiplicity of details, lines and shapes. 
B.  Buildings and structures should be in harmony in texture and materials with uses on adjacent lots and themselves. Adjacent buildings of different architectural styles should be made compatible by such means as screens, sight breaks and materials. 
C.  The site should be planned to accomplish an attractive transition to the streetscape and to provide for adequate planning, safe pedestrian movement and parking areas. 
D.  Parking should be treated with decorative elements, such as wall extensions, plantings, berms or other innovative means, so as to screen parking areas from streets. 
E.  Utility services should be underground. 
F.  Trash receptacle areas should be fully screened with a combination of evergreen shrubs and opaque materials. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.073; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-07, § 4, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.30.074.1. - Building materials. 
    Consistent with the above, except in the M districts, any facade facing a street should be made of masonry, stone, glass or architecturally precast concrete panels. The side exterior walls may be of metal except that the lower third or lower seven (7) feet, whichever is less, of the wall should be of masonry, stone, glass or architecturally precast concrete panels. 
(Code 1981, § 17.30.074; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part))

CHAPTER 17.40. - PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 17.40.010. - General provisions. 
    Every development or change of use shall provide off-street parking and loading facilities consistent with the provisions in this chapter. Without restricting the above, this includes standards related to the number of spaces, the dimensions for parking stalls and aisles, street access, surfacing, drainage, lighting, pedestrian safety, loading and stacking. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.010; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
ARTICLE I. - PARKING SPACES REQUIRED 

Sec. 17.40.021. - Basic requirement. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, every development or change of use shall provide a sufficient number of off street parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that are likely to be attracted to the development or use during the peak hour of a typical weekday or weekend, whichever is greater. In calculating the number of parking spaces needed, the number of spaces established for uses in the Table of Parking Standards, Section 17.40.100, Table 17.43, is presumed to be sufficient; however, the permit issuing authority may, where appropriate, establish a different number of spaces by calculating the need from the appropriate methodology set out in the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) reference manual entitled "Parking Generation" or from studies undertaken in the Village or other similarly sized communities. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.021; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O09-02-05, § 2, 2-17-2009) 
Sec. 17.40.022. - Expansion of an existing use or change of use. 
    Notwithstanding the above, where the nature of the development consists of one or more additions to an existing structure, the number of additional off-street parking spaces required shall be limited to only those spaces required to address the addition(s). Where the nature of the development consists of a change of use, the number of additional spaces required shall be limited to only the difference between the new and existing use. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.022; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.40.023. - Interpretation. 
    Uses in the table of parking standards are keyed to the table of permitted uses. When a determination of the number of parking spaces required by this table results in a requirement of a fraction of a space, any fraction shall be counted as one (1) parking space. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.023; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
ARTICLE II. - SATELLITE PARKING 

Sec. 17.40.031. - General. 
    If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.031; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.40.032. - Location. 
    Satellite parking spaces, other than those intended for employee use, shall be located within six hundred (600) feet of a public entrance of a principal building in the use associated with such parking. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.032; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.40.033. - Control. 
    The owner of a lot being used for satellite parking shall present to the permit issuing authority restrictive covenants running with the land and recorded in the office of the Recorder in McHenry County. The covenants shall limit the use of the portion of the lot to be used as parking to that purpose and shall clearly identify the site benefiting from the use. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.033; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.40.040. - Shared parking. 
A.  One (1) parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as provided below, the required space assigned to one (1) use may not be credited to any other use. 
B.  To the extent that two (2) or more uses experience peak parking demand at different times during the day, some parking spaces may be counted as meeting the demand for both uses. In determining the parking requirements where the uses intend to share parking, the permit issuing authority will establish the peak hourly demand by calculating such a need from the appropriate methodology set out in the most recent version of the ITE reference manual "Parking Generation," or from studies undertaken in the Village or other similarly sized communities. Persons intending to take advantage of this provision are required to demonstrate that an enforceable agreement exists between the parties who intend to share the parking.

Sec. 17.40.082. - Number of loading spaces required. 
A.  The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that are anticipated to use this area. The following table indicates the number and size of spaces that are presumed to satisfy this requirement; however, the permit issuing authority may require more or less loading and unloading area where it determines that such an area is needed for the development. 
B.  Uses which normally handle large quantities of goods, including, but not limited to, the following use categories-schools, churches, care facilities, hospitals, retail sales, wholesale sales, storage, manufacturing, and agricultural-shall provide off-street loading facilities as follows: 
Gross Building Floor Area (GFA) 
in Square Feet Number of Spaces 2,500 to 19,999 1 20,000 to 39,999 2 40,000 to 99,999 3 Each additional 100,000 1  
C.  Uses which do not normally handle large quantities of goods shall provide off-street loading facilities in the following amounts: 
Gross Building Floor Area (GFA) 
in Square Feet Number of Spaces 5,000 to 79,999 1 80,000 to 200,000 2 Each additional 200,000 1  
(Code 1981, § 17.40.082; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 13, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.40.083. - Location. 
    Loading and unloading areas shall be located and designed so that the vehicles intended to use them can maneuver safety and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or without substantially obstructing or interfering with on-site parking and movement of vehicles in the vehicle accommodation area. Loading and unloading areas shall be demarcated with signage restricting such areas exclusively to loading and unloading use. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.083; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.40.084. - Surfacing. 
    All loading and unloading areas shall be surfaced and constructed to the standards set for all vehicle accommodation areas, namely Section 17.40.052. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.084; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.40.090. - Storage and stacking spaces required. 
A.  Whenever a use involves the stacking of vehicles awaiting service, the developer shall provide a stacking lane with a sufficient length to accommodate the peak demand for the peak day in the typical week. In the absence of any relevant data, any stacking lane shall be long enough to stack six (6) motor vehicles. Whenever a use involves the storage of vehicles on the lot, the number of storage spaces shall be that sufficient to accommodate peak demand for the peak day in the typical week. That number may be established from studies undertaken in the Village or from other similar sized communities for that type use. A storage space may have access to an aisle through another storage space. 
B.  Storage and parking are similar concepts, the principal difference being in access to the space. Since the developer has control over all vehicles in storage, he should be able to store one (1) vehicle immediately behind another. 
(Code 1981, § 17.40.090; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 14, 8-19-2003)

CHAPTER 17.50. - SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS 

Sec. 17.50.010. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to address uses and methods of combining uses which may have specific, more stringent, siting needs which if not met may make the use undesirable from a public point of view. These standards must be read in conjunction with the Table Dimensional Standards (see Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26), addressing all uses. Where there is a conflict between the two (2) standards, unless the supplemental standard specifically provides otherwise, the more restrictive standard applies. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.010; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O09-02-05, § 2, 2-17-2009) 
ARTICLE I. - MULTIFAMILY AND SINGLE-FAMILY ATTACHED DWELLINGS 

Sec. 17.50.021. - Density. 
A.  The maximum allowable density in dwelling units per acre for multifamily and single-family attached residential dwellings as measured on the predevelopment tract is as follows: 
Density by Zoning District 
Lot Size (acres) 
R3 9.00 units per acre
B1 or B3R 18.00 units per acre
Other Districts  9.00 units per acre
0.00-1.99 4.50 6.75 2.25 2.00-3.49 6.75 9.00 4.50 3.50-4.99 9.00 13.50 6.75 5.00 and above    
B.  The maximum allowable density is based on the net developable acreage as set out in the architecturally integrated subdivision, as set out in Section 17.50.043, and is the net density as described in the definitions. 
C.  The predevelopment tract is the tract prior to the proposed subdivision creating lots for the individual units. 
D.  The maximum allowable density may be increased above the standards set forth in Paragraph A for developments which incorporate senior housing, assisted living, or other institutional uses when approved as part of a conditional use permit. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.021; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 17, 8-19-2003; Ord. No. O03-08-07, § 5, 8-19-2003; Ord. No. O16-04-02 , § 2, 4-19-2016) 
Sec. 17.50.022. - Minimum lot size and lot width. 
    Any lot subdivided for a single-family attached residential dwelling unit shall have a minimum lot area of four thousand (4,000) square feet and a minimum lot width of thirty (30) feet. End lots shall have a minimum lot width of forty (40) feet. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.022; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.023. - Number of ground floor dwelling units in a building. 
    Except for within a senior housing, assisted living, or other institutional use when approved as part of a conditional use permit, no more than six (6) dwelling units shall be located on the ground floor in any building. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.023; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O16-04-02 , § 2, 4-19-2016) 
Sec. 17.50.024. - Buildings. 
A.  Every attached single-family residential dwelling unit and every multifamily dwelling unit shall be separated from every part of any other building in principal use in accordance with the following table: 
Building Alignment Wall Details Minimum Distance (feet) Front facing front, side or rear 50 Rear facing front, side or rear 40 Side facing front or rear Less than 3 windows 30 Side facing front or rear 3 windows or more 40 Side facing front or rear Main entrance inside wall 50 Side facing side Less than 3 windows 18 Side facing side 3 windows or more 40 Side facing side Main entrance inside wall 50  
B.  For purpose of applying this section, windows in bathrooms and storage rooms are not counted. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.024; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
ARTICLE II. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 17.50.031. - Intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide flexibility, consistent with the public health and safety to the owner of a large tract of land who sets out an integrated comprehensive plan of development for the entire tract of land involving residential and other uses, substantial open space and amenities. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.031; Ord. No. 00-2-4, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.032. - General standards. 
A.  The overall plan of the development must be comprehensive, embracing land, buildings, landscaping and their interrelationships, and must conform with the comprehensive plan of the Village. 
B.  The plan must provide for adequate open space, circulation, off-street parking and pertinent amenities. Buildings, structures and facilities in the development must be well integrated, oriented and related to the topographic and natural landscape features of the site. 
C.  The development must be compatible with existing and planned uses, and with circulation patterns on adjoining properties. It must not constitute a disruptive element to the neighborhood or community. 
D.  The internal street system must not be a dominant feature in the overall design, but it should be designed for the efficient and safe flow of vehicles without creating a disruptive influence on the activity and function of any common areas and facilities. 
E.  The common areas and recreational facilities must be located so as to be readily accessible to the occupants of the dwelling units, and must be well related to any common open spaces provided. 
F.  The architectural harmony within the development, neighborhood and community must be achieved to the extent practicable. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.032; Ord. No. 00-2-4, § 1(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.033. - Specific standards. 
A.  Tract size. The predevelopment tract must consist of at least forty (40) acres. The predevelopment tract is as defined in Section 17.50.021. The tract size shall not be reduced except as provided in the master plan. 
B.  Master plan. The development will include a master plan which shall delineate general use areas, such as residential, commercial, industrial or park, and shall indicate a set of specific uses pertinent to that use area, and the standards for development that will apply. The developer may satisfy this requirement by indicating that in a particular use area, the table of uses and dimensional standards for a particular district shall apply. The developer should identify any standard in the subdivision ordinance (see Title 16) that will not be complied with, and the extent of the noncompliance. The master plan will have the same level of detail as a preliminary plat under the subdivision ordinance and shall be processed and comply in all respects with that ordinance. The words "Planned Development" shall appear in the title of any plat seeking to use this style of development. 
C.  Gross density. Except to the extent that it may be increased by the "bonus density" provision set out in Subsection D of this section, the maximum density of the development shall not exceed the standard for residential density as set out in the table of dimensional standards, Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26, for the zoning district in which the planned development lies. The maximum number of dwelling units which can be built in the planned development is calculable by multiplying the net developable acreage by the density for the district as set out in that table. The net developable acreage is the gross acreage less any lands in floodway, regulatory wetlands, detention dry ponds, and street rights-of-way. Land in nonresidential uses, other than open space uses such as golf courses, polo fields, and the like, shall not constitute more than ten percent (10%) of the planned development. Nonresidential uses shall be intended to primarily serve other uses in the planned development. 
D.  Bonus density. The gross density of the development as set out in the table of dimensional standards, Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26, may be increased by up to thirty percent (30%) for developments that have exceptionally attractive elements of design, unusual amenities, that will build and dedicate infrastructure beyond that needed to serve the development, and that would create substantial revenues from sources other than property taxes for the Village. 
E.  Dimensional deviations. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section and except as provided in this subsection, any lot created shall be developed so as to at least meet the table of dimensional standards, Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26, for the R2 district. The minimum lot area of lots abutting a common open space may be further reduced by twenty-three percent (23%), provided that the standards related to open space in Subsection J of this section are complied with. Furthermore, to the extent that the planned development includes site elevations and footprints for buildings planned on adjacent lots, the side and rear yard setbacks between those lots may be further reduced to the same extent as allowable under the provisions for architecturally integrated subdivisions, as set out in Article III of this chapter. In order to take advantage of this article, the developer shall submit architectural drawings consistent with Section 17.50.046 and comply with the standards in that section. Any reference to preliminary plat in that section shall be deemed to refer to the master plan under this article. 
F.  Exterior lots. Any lot to be created in the planned development which is adjacent to a lot or tract of land not in the planned development tract shall be developed consistent with the standards of the zoning district in which that tract lies, or those of the R2 district, whichever is more restrictive. 
G.  Street classification. The master plan will classify each segment of street. For purpose of this article, streets with a significantly different cross section may be classified differently notwithstanding they generally belong to the same class of street. Thus, where a master plan incorporates a local street with a vegetated median and one without, the plan might include both a "Local A" and a "Local B" class street. 
H.  Building line. Where the plan does not indicate where the principal buildings will be located, the development shall set forth a building line, which shall be the same distance from the right-of-way for each class of street. At least a part of the front elevation of every principal building will be located within five (5) feet of that line. 
I.  Bike and/or pedestrian trails. The development will provide a fully improved off-street bike and/or pedestrian system which winds throughout the development, and where practical, shall be extended to adjoining developments and connected to existing bike or pedestrian trails. 
J.  Open space. The amount of useable open space shall exceed forty percent (40%) of the development. In addition, any land saved from reductions allowed in Subsection E of this section shall be set aside as useable open space. Any open space created shall be placed in a property owner's association, or shall, with the Village's consent, be placed in the ownership of a single entity, or be dedicated to the Village or another public or quasi-public entity. In the event that the property is placed in a nonpublic entity, the developer will provide through restrictive covenants that the property will not be developed and that it will be maintained as open space in a manner consistent with the master plan. 
K.  Special studies required. Any plan submitted shall provide and be accompanied by any information necessary for the full review of the proposal. In addition to the information required for site plans under Chapter 17.80, Article III, the following information shall be provided: demographic analysis identifying the projected population and number of school age children; traffic impact analysis indicating peak and average daily trips added to the road network, places of impact and the ability of the receiving roads to accommodate the trips; and a fiscal impact analysis projecting the increase in revenues and expenses to the Village from the development. 
L.  Emergency access. Because of the flexibility allowed in this article, every planned development shall be required to demonstrate that the Village and other emergency service providers will have adequate access to each building for purpose of police and fire protection. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.033; Ord. No. 00-2-4, § 1 (part)) 
ARTICLE III. - CLUSTER AND ARCHITECTURALLY INTEGRATED SUBDIVISIONS 

Sec. 17.50.041. - Intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide flexibility, consistent with the public health and safety and without increasing overall density, to the developer who subdivides property and aggregates his or her open space in one or more tracts, thereby providing enhanced recreational benefits to his or her development and enhanced protection of natural features, such as wetlands or wooded areas, and, in the case of architecturally integrated subdivisions, constructs buildings on the lots created in accordance with a unified plan of development. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.041; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.042. - General standards. 
A.  Cluster. In any subdivision of a tract consisting of ten (10) acres of land or more, the developer may create lots which deviate from the minimum lot size and lot width; except that the dimensional standards for any lot created shall not be reduced below the dimensional standards of the next most intensive district. 
1.  For purpose of this section, the next most intensive district is as follows: 
District Next Most 
Intensive District E1 R1 R1 R1A R1A R2 R2 R3 Other R3  
2.  Furthermore, the developer shall demonstrate that at least ten percent (10%) of the tract is characterized by significant natural features deserving protection, and that for the most part those areas will be placed into open space. The words "Cluster" shall appear in the title of any plat seeking to use this style of development. 
3.  For purpose of this section, the lot area of the R3 district shall be construed as being twenty-two and one-half percent (221/2%) less than the lot area of the R2 district and the lot width of the R3 district shall be construed as the same as the R2 district. 
B.  Architecturally integrated subdivision. In any cluster subdivision, the developer may create lots and construct buildings which deviate from the minimum side and rear yard setbacks except for those lots abutting land that is not part of the subdivision. The development will comply with the standards for cluster set out in Subsection A of this section. The words "Architecturally Integrated Subdivision" shall appear in the title of any plat seeking to use this style of development. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.042; Ord. No. 00-2-4, § 5(part); Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 18, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.50.043. - Density. 
    The number of lots or dwelling units allowed in a cluster or architecturally integrated subdivision shall not exceed the number obtained by multiplying the net developable acreage by the density for the district as set out in the table of dimensional standards located at Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26. The net developable acreage is the gross acreage less any lands in floodway, regulatory wetlands, detention dry ponds, and street rights-of-way. 

(Code 1981, § 17.50.043; Ord. No. 00-2-4, § 5(part); Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.044. - Usable open space. 
    To the extent reasonably practicable, the amount of land saved by creating lots that are smaller than the standards set forth in Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26 shall be set aside as usable open space. Furthermore, the amount of usable open space provided shall exceed forty percent (40%) of the development. At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the lots that are reduced in size shall be adjacent to the open space created. Any open space created shall be placed in a property owner's association, or shall, with the Village's consent, be dedicated to the Village or another public entity. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.044; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 18, 8-19-2003; Ord. No. O09-02-05, § 2, 2-17-2009) 
Sec. 17.50.045. - Emergency access. 
    Because of the flexibility allowed in this article, every architecturally integrated subdivision shall be required to demonstrate that the Village and other emergency service providers will have adequate access to each dwelling unit for purpose of police and fire protection. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.045; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.046. - Architectural drawings. 
    Where a developer proposes to use the architecturally integrated style of development to deviate from the yard requirements in this title, any preliminary plat submitted shall be accompanied by architectural drawings showing the facades and footprints of the proposed structures. These drawings may be roughly drawn at the preliminary plat stage, with the focus on window placement, orientation and distance between buildings, and with provisions addressing privacy. These matters will be more definitively addressed in submittals accompanying the final plan. Every development will provide at least five (5) different front facades. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.046; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.050. - Commercial and industrial performance standards. 
A.  Smoke. For the purpose of determining the density or equivalent opacity of smoke, the Ringlemann Chart, as adopted and published by the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines Info. Circular 8333, May 1967, shall be used. The Ringlemann number referred to in this section refers to the number of the area on the Ringlemann Chart that coincides most nearly with the visual density or equivalent opacity of the emission of the smoke observed. For example, a reading of Ringlemann No. 1 indicates a twenty percent (20%) density of the smoke observed. All measurements shall be taken at the point of emission of the smoke. 
1.  In all districts other than the M district, no Subsection 17.23.830 use (industrial uses) (Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030) shall emit from a vent, stack, chimney, or combustible process any smoke that is visible to the naked eye. 
2.  In the M district, no Subsection 17.23.830 use shall emit from a vent, stack, chimney, or combustible process any smoke that exceeds a density or equivalent capacity of Ringlemann No. 1, except that an emission of Ringlemann No. 2 is permissible for a duration of not more than four (4) minutes during any eight (8) hour period if the source of the emission is not located within two hundred fifty (250) feet of a residential district. 
B.  Noise. A decibel is a measure of unit of sound pressure. Since sound waves which have the same decibel level seem louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles per second (i.e., whether the pitch of the sound is high or low), an A-weighted filter constructed in accordance with the specifications of the American National Standards Institute, which automatically takes account of the varying effect on the human ear of different pitches, shall be used on any sound level meter taking measurements required by this section. Accordingly, all measurements expressed in this section are expressed in dB(A) to reflect the use of this A-weighted filter. The standards established in the table set out below are expressed in terms of the equivalent sound level (Leq), which must be calculated by taking one hundred (100) instantaneous A-weighted sound levels at ten (10) second intervals (see Appendix A-1) and computing the Leq in accordance with the table set forth in Appendix A-2. 
1.  No Subsection 17.23.830 (Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030) use may generate any noise in a district other than an M district that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon uses located on adjacent lots, or other uses on the same lot. 
2.  Except as provided in Subsection B.3 of this section, the table below establishes the maximum permitted noise level for a Subsection 17.23.830 use in an M district. Measurements shall be taken at the boundary of the lot where the Subsection 17.23.830 use is located. 
Table of Maximum Permitted Sound Levels Zoning of Adjacent Lot Noise Level dB(A) E1 50 R1, R1A, R2, R3, B4 50 B1, B2, B3, BP 55 M 60  
3.  Impact noises are sounds that occur intermittently rather than continuously. Impact noises generated by sources that do not operate more than one (1) minute in any one (1) hour period are permissible up to a level of ten (10) dB(A) in excess of the figures listed in Subsection B.2 of this section, except that this higher level of permissible noise shall not apply from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. when the adjacent lot is zoned residentially. The impact noise shall be measured using the fast response of the sound level meter. 
4.  Noise resulting from temporary construction activity, excluding demolition activity, that occurs between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. Noise resulting from demolition activity that occurs during the following hours shall be exempt from the requirements of this section: Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. All demolition permits must be approved by the Village Board. The Village Board and Village staff may place additional operating conditions on the permit, including, but not limited to, hours and days of operation and dust control regulations. 
C.  Vibration. The instrument used to measure vibrations shall be a three (3) component measuring system capable of simultaneous measurement of vibration in three (3) mutually perpendicular directions. The vibration maximums set forth in Subsection C.2 of this section are stated in terms of particle velocity, which may be measured directly with suitable instrumentation or computed on the basis of displacement and frequency. When computed, the following formula shall be used: 
P.V. = 6.28 F x D 
Where: 
P.V. equals particle velocity in inches per second; 
F equals vibration frequency in cycles per second; and 
D equals single amplitude displacement of the vibration in inches. 
The maximum velocity shall be the vector sum of the three (3) components recorded. 
1.  No Subsection 17.23.830 (Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030) use shall generate any ground transmitted vibration in a district other than an M district that is perceptible to the human sense of touch measured at the lot line, or where the enterprise is not the only one located on the lot, at the outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the enterprise generating the vibration. 
2.  No Subsection 17.23.830 (Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030) use shall generate any ground transmitted vibration in an M district that exceeds the limits set out in the following table. 
Table of Maximum Ground
Transmitted Vibration Adjacent Zoning District Particle Velocity 
(Inches Per Second) E1, R1, R1A, R2, R3 0.02 Other 0.10  
The values above shall be multiplied by two (2) for impact vibrations (i.e., discrete vibration pulsations not exceeding one (1) second between pulses). 
3.  Vibrations resulting from temporary construction activity, excluding demolition activity, that occurs between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. Vibrations resulting from demolition activity that occurs during the following hours shall be exempt from the requirements of this section: Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. All demolition permits must be approved by the Village Board. The Village Board and Village staff may place additional operating conditions on the permit, including, but not limited to, hours and days of operation and dust control regulations. 
D.  Odors. For purposes of this section, the "odor threshold" is defined as the minimum concentration in air of a gas, vapor, or particulate matter that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of healthy observers. No Subsection 17.23.830 (Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030) use in any district may generate any odor that reaches the odor threshold, measured at the lot line, or in where the enterprise is not the only one located on the lot, at the outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the enterprise generating the odor. 
E.  Air or water pollution. Any Subsection 17.23.830 (Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030) use that emits an air contaminant or water pollutant regulated by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency shall comply with applicable State standards concerning air and water pollution. No zoning or conditional use permit shall be issued with respect to any development subject to such a permit until the agency has certified to the permit issuing authority that the appropriate permit applications have been received, that the developer is eligible to receive such permits, and that the development is otherwise in compliance with applicable pollution control laws. Any discharge into the Village's wastewater treatment plant shall require the Village's consent and unless specifically agreed to shall not contain waste that cannot be adequately treated by biological means. 
F.  Electrical disturbance or interference. No Subsection 17.23.830 (Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030) use may create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any operations or equipment other than those of the creator of such disturbance, or otherwise causes, creates or contributes to the interference with electronic signals to the extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator of such disturbance is adversely affected. 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.050; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O09-10-02, § 2, 10-6-2009)

(Ord. No. O08-02-08, § 2F(17.50.051), 2-19-2008; Ord. No. O09-02-05, § 2, 2-17-2009) 
Sec. 17.50.060. - Integrated shopping center. 
A.  An integrated shopping center is a unified commercial development. It is a combination of underlying uses. The advantages in obtaining a permit for this use as opposed to the individual uses is that when the underlying use (e.g., a Class 1 retail establishment) changes to another underlying use (e.g., a laundry), a new zoning or conditional use permit is not required. 
B.  An integrated shopping center requires at least fifteen (15) acres of land in one ownership. All structures on the lot shall be architecturally integrated and coordinated with each other. 
C.  The underlying uses are limited to only those allowed in the district in the following use classifications: Subsections 17.23.210, 17.23.310, 17.23.410, 17.23.420, 17.23.510, 17.23.520, 17.25.530, 17.23.710 and 17.23.940 (all references are to subsections in the Table of Permitted Uses, Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030). 
(Code 1981, § 17.50.060; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.50.070. - Home occupations. 
    A home occupation is a commercial activity which is accessory, incidental and customary to a residential use. Provided, however, any use identified in Table 17.23 in Section 17.20.030, Table of Permitted Uses, as a conditional use "C" in the manufacturing (M) zoning district shall not be considered to be a home occupation and shall be prohibited in a residential use. 
    For the purpose of this definition, "neighborhood" shall be defined as an area within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject property and on the same street or a street which crosses that street. 
A.  Home occupation, Type A. A Type A home occupation is a home occupation that meets the following standards: 
1.  Location. The commercial activity is conducted on the lot and within the principal building in residential use. 
2.  Ownership. At least one of the persons engaged in the commercial activity is an owner of the residence. 
3.  Outside employment. Only one person not residing on the property shall be employed in the commercial activity. 
4.  Nature of commercial activity. The uses shall not involve any manufacturing. All aspects of the business will be conducted within the building in principal use. There will be no outside display or sales of goods connected with the commercial activity. 
5.  Size of the use. The area regularly or normally used for the home occupation shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of the building in principal use, or five hundred (500) square feet, whichever is less. 
6.  Parking. Parking accessory to the use shall not exceed two (2) spaces. 
7.  Traffic. The home occupation will not create more than twenty-five (25) trips per day. 
8.  Deliveries. The home occupation will not result in the delivery of goods by tractor trailers to the residence. 
9.  Appearance. Residential structures with a home occupation shall maintain the residential character of the structure and be consistent architecturally with other residential structures in the neighborhood. 
10.  Impact on neighborhood. The commercial activity shall not create any noise, vibration, heat, glare, fumes, odor, dust, radiation or electrical interference which is discernible at the property line. 
B.  Home occupation, Type B. A Type B home occupation is a home occupation that meets the following standards: 
1.  Location. The commercial activity is conducted on the lot. 
2.  Ownership. At least one (1) of the persons engaged in the commercial activity is an owner or occupant of the residence.

(Code 1981, § 17.50.090; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O01-03-02, § 2, 3-20-2001; Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 19, 8-19-2003; Ord. No. O11-08-06, § 2, 8-16-2011) 
Sec. 17.50.100. - Table of supplemental standards. 
    While the table of dimensional standards (found in Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26) establishes dimensional standards applicable to all uses by district, some uses shall have more stringent dimensional standards, which if not met, make the use allowable on a given site. The following table, known as the "Table of Supplemental Standards," addresses the dimensional requirements required of specific uses in all districts or in selected districts. These standards must be read in conjunction with the table of dimensional standards addressing all uses. Where there is a conflict between the two (2) standards, unless the supplemental standard specifically provides otherwise, the more restrictive standard applies. In interpreting this table, the column headings shall be interpreted as follows: 
A.  District. District in which the standards set out for the use in this row of the table do not apply. If the cell is marked with "Except B1," it means the standard is not applicable in the B1 district. 
B.  Lot area. Same as in the Table of Dimensional Standards (Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26). 
C.  Lot width. Same as in the Table of Dimensional Standards (Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26). 
D.  Distance from residential use. Minimum distance in feet required between every portion of a building, or area in the use, in the case of uses primarily conducted outside a structure, and any lot in a detached single-family residential use or in the El, R1, R1A or R2 residential zoning districts. 
E.  First floor. If marked with a "No," the use is not allowed on the first or ground floor in the B1 district. 
F.  Other. Additional standards which do not lend themselves to being set out in tabular form.

Sec. 17.50.122. - Review procedure. 
    All proposed land development within the park and open space districts which involves construction of a structure or use, modifications or additions to an existing structure or use that will alter the existing footprint, and/or other substantial alternations to a site shall be subject to the following: 
A.  Site development plan review. To encourage the creation of a park use environment that is compatible with the residential character of the Village, zoning permits for permitted uses in the parks and open space districts shall not be issued without review and approval in accordance with the site plan procedures and standards of Chapter 17.80. So long as a proposed use is permitted in the parks and open space districts, the bulk standards are met, the setback requirements are complied with and any other conditions contained in the respective parks and open space districts have been met as determined by the Director of Community Development, then approval of the proposed use shall be granted. If a proposed use necessitates a site plan submittal per Section 17.80.042, but the proposed use is the same as an existing permitted use in the park and open space zoning district that meets the bulk standards, setback requirements and any other applicable conditions contained in the park and open space zoning districts as determined by the Director of Community Development and the proposed use is a replacement of an existing permitted use where the footprint of said use is not made greater or expanded upon, the site plan submission shall not be required to include items c, d, f, h, j, k, m or r of Section 17.80.042(B). 
(Ord. No. O11-04-03, § 2, 4-26-2011)

CHAPTER 17.60. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference- Nonconformities, 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1. 

Sec. 17.60.010. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming lots, uses, buildings and structures, and to specify the circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures, uses and lots may continue or shall be gradually eliminated in accordance with the authority granted by State statutes. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.010; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
1 The ordinance codified in Chapter 17.60 takes a more liberal approach to nonconforming uses. This change is justified under the theory that nonconforming situations do not fade away, they just become more run down. Thus, the choice is more realistically one of a bad nonconformity versus a better nonconformity. 
Sec. 17.60.020. - Continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects. 
    Nonconforming situations that were lawful on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be continued, subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in this chapter. Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section 17.60.090 et seq. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.020; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
2 See Chapter 17.90 for definitions of "Nonconforming situations" and "Nonconforming projects." 
Sec. 17.60.030. - Nonconforming lots. 
    Where a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot cannot meet the minimum lot area or lot width requirement set out in Section 17.20.040, Table 17.26, then the lot may be used just as if it were conforming. However, no use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size in the particular district is permissible on the nonconforming lot. Where a nonconforming lot is adjacent to another lot which was in the same ownership at any time between the creation of the nonconforming status and that of the application for a permit under this chapter, then neither the owner of the lot or his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.030; Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
3 In many older subdivisions, lots were intended to be combined to form a buildable lot. 
Sec. 17.60.040. - Extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations. 
4 Nonconforming situations include nonconforming lots, structures and uses. 
Sec. 17.60.041. - Extension of nonconforming situation prohibited. 
A.  Except as specifically provided in this chapter, no person may engage in any developmental action that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in either: 
1.  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or 
2.  A greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions. 
B.  Where a nonconforming situation exists, the volume, intensity, or frequency of use of the property may be increased, and the equipment or processes used at a location may be changed provided these or similar changes amount only to a change in the degree, as opposed to kind, of activity. 
C.  A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming. A nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building which, at the time the use became nonconforming, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate the use. 
D.  Notwithstanding the above, any nonconforming structure used for single-family residential purposes may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.041; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
5 The ordinance codified in this Chapter 17.60 permits the replacement of a deteriorated single-family residence with a new larger one, providing new nonconformities are not created or existing ones enlarged. 
Sec. 17.60.050. - Repair, maintenance and reconstruction. 
Sec. 17.60.051. - Repairs encouraged. 
    Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of structures where nonconforming situations exist are permitted. A major renovation is one were the costs of renovation are more than the assessed valuation. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.051; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 17.60.052. - Facade alterations encouraged. 
    Alterations to the facades of structures where nonconforming situations exist are permitted provided they are consistent with the design standards set out in Section 17.30.071 et seq. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.052; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 17.60.053. - Reconstruction of damaged residential single-family dwelling units. 
    In the event that a building exclusively in residential use in a residential district is partially or totally damaged that residential dwelling unit may be rebuilt or replaced by another unit as long as the use is conforming and the replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities, and further provided that work is started within one (1) year of the occurrence and is diligently pursued to completion. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.053; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 23, 8-19-2003; Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
6 Assessed valuation is the value placed on the building for real property tax purposes by McHenry County. As a general rule of thumb, the assessed value is thirty percent (30%) of the fair market value. 
Sec. 17.60.054. - Reconstruction of other residential dwelling units and of nonresidential buildings. 
    In the event that a building in nonresidential use is damaged to the extent that cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence will exceed two (2) times the assessed valuation of the building at that time, then any construction must comply with all the standards of this chapter. If the extent of the damage is less than that set out above, the building may be restored or reconstructed provided that the construction will not create any new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities, and further provided that work is started within one (1) year of the occurrence and is diligently pursued to completion. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.054; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 23, 8-19-2003; Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 17.60.060. - Change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists. 
    A nonconforming, nonstructural use of the land may not be changed to any use but a conforming use. When a nonconforming use of the land or a structure has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.060; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 17.60.070. - Moving. 
    No building or structure shall be moved in whole or part to any other location unless every portion of such building or structure, and the use thereof is made to conform to all regulations in this chapter. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.070; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 17.60.080. - Abandonment of a nonconforming use. 
    Whenever any nonconforming use is discontinued for a period in excess of one hundred eighty (180) days with an intent to abandon the use, any future use shall be limited to those uses permitted under this chapter. The vacancy or nonuse of the land or structure shall be presumed to constitute a discontinuance under this provision. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.080; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
7 The abandonment of all uses for a structure does not make the structure itself or the lot illegal. 
Sec. 17.60.090. - Completion of nonconforming projects. 
Sec. 17.60.091. - Vested rights of outstanding building projects. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall require any change in the plans, construction, size or designated use of any building, structure or part thereof for which a building permit, zoning permit, or a conditional use permit has been validly issued and which remains valid. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.091; Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 17.60.092. - Vested rights of other projects. 
    Except as provided in Section 17.60.091, all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects shall be revoked as of that date. Thereafter, work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a building permit, zoning permit or conditional use permit issued in accordance with this section. The permit issuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has, in good faith, made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it previously existed at the time in which good faith reliance occurred and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed. Where a developer's plans indicate an intent to build in phases, his position shall be examined in respect to each phase. In considering whether these findings may be made, the permit issuing authority shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations: 
    This chapter establishes the circumstances under which a vested right is obtained, just as it does with respect to other nonconforming situations. It directs the administrator to examine how the developer's position is changed as a result of the change in this chapter. 
A.  All expenditures made to obtain a building, zoning or conditional use permit that was validly issued shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance. Furthermore, a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if his action precedes a setting of a public hearing at which the change in the land use law was proposed. 
B.  To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made the expenditures. 
C.  To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made the expenditures. 
D.  An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated costs of the proposed project. 
Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the village has issued a building permit to use a structure in accordance with the law prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and where construction has begun within six (6) months of such effective date and is being prosecuted to completion, the structure may be completed in accordance with approved plans on the basis of which the building permit was issued; and further, upon completion, may be occupied under a certificate of occupancy by the use originally designated. 
(Code 1981, § 17.60.092; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
Sec. 17.60.100. - Relief. 
    The owner of any building, structure or use which is subject to discontinuation or abandonment under the terms of this chapter may apply to the Board of Zoning, Planning and Appeals for a conditional use to allow such building, structure or use to continue or be re-established. In such event, the procedures, terms, conditions, and standards for conditional uses set forth in Section 17.70.040 shall be used to evaluate the application. 
(Ord. No. O13-05-01, § 1, 5-7-2013) 
8 The ordinance codified in this Chapter 17.60 establishes the circumstances under which a vested right is obtained, just as it does with respect to other nonconforming situations. It directs the administrator to examine how the developer's position is changed as a result of the change in the ordinance. This chapter widens the range of vested rights situations. However, in order to take advantage of these rights, the developer is required to present evidence showing detrimental reliance. While not required, an informal hearing to receive evidence is suggested.

ARTICLE II. - POWERS AND DUTIES 

Sec. 17.70.021. - General. 
    The Zoning Board of Appeals is an administrative agency which acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. The Board has the duty to investigate facts and from its investigation to draw conclusions as a basis of official action, and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature. It lacks the authority to amend this title. On the other hand, where the Board finds that unfair or unjust situations are recurring under the title and for which it cannot grant relief, then the Board is authorized to recommend to the Village Board of Trustees that this title be amended to address the situation. The Zoning Board of Appeals' powers and duties are as set out below and include the following: 
A.  Make a recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees concerning the granting or denying of a variation from the strict letter of this title; 
B.  Acting as a Board of Appeals from the Director of Community Development's decision or any other administrative officer's decision under this title or any other ordinance whose standards are incorporated by reference into this title; 
C.  Resolving ambiguities in the language and application of this title; 
D.  Taking actions allowed by law in furtherance of implementing the above, including, but not limited to, approving minutes, issuing subpoenas and restraining orders. 
(Code 1981, § 17.70.021; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part); Ord. No. O03-08-06, § 41, 8-19-2003) 
Sec. 17.70.022. - Appeals from administrative officers. 
A.  The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide any appeal where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Director of Community Development, or any other person authorized to make an administrative decision under this title, or any other ordinance whose standards are incorporated by reference into this title. 
B.  Any person who is aggrieved by an order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Director of Community Development, or other person purporting to act under administrative authority pursuant to this title or any other ordinance for which the Board has been given authority to hear an appeal from that officer's decision, may appeal by filing, within forty-five (45) days of the action, with that official and the Zoning Board of Appeals a notice of appeal and stating the grounds for the appeal. 
C.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Director of Community Development from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals that, by reason of the facts stated in his or her certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause an imminent peril to life or property. In this event the proceedings shall not be stayed unless the Zoning Board of Appeals or circuit court issues a restraining order. 
(Code 1981, § 17.70.022; Ord. No. 97-10-6, § 2(part)) 
Sec. 17.70.025. - Text and map amendments (i.e., reclassifications). 
    The Plan Commission shall hear and make a recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees to approve or deny any application for a text or map amendment. It shall recommend the amendment be approved where the applicant has demonstrated by the preponderance of the evidence that the standards set out below are met. It shall recommend the permit be denied where the applicant has failed to meet that burden. Similarly, the Village Board of Trustees will approve or deny an application pursuant to the same standards as follows: 
A.  Text and map amendments. 
1.  The proposed amendment is not detrimental to the orderly development of the Village. 
2.  The proposed amendment shall not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community of the Village. 
3.  The proposed amendment promotes the public interest and not solely the interest of the applicant.
