PREFACE 
PRM LAW PUBLISHERS, a division of Public Research and Management, Inc., of Atlanta, Georgia, is pleased to publish the Code of East Point, Georgia. This volume contains the City Charter, related laws and the code of ordinances of the city. 
The Code of Ordinances is an entirely new codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature. All obsolete, illegal, or superseded ordinances have been repealed as part of the codification. The Code has been adopted by the mayor and council through the enactment of a single ordinance and thus constitutes the general body of ordinance enactments of the city. 
The Code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles of the Code follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the index at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section by section analysis of articles within the chapter. 
Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals, and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in Part 1 of this Code that applies to the entire Code of Ordinances. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes such as state law references and cross references have been included throughout the code to clarify its provisions. 
This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The citations included at the end of sections refer to the official source and date of former Code sections and original ordinances. Sections of the Code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been added to fill in gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida, will publish supplements to keep the Code current. Supplements are printed in looseleaf form so that all new ordinances may be inserted in the Code on a regular basis. 
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the municipal officials in the preparation of this Code.

BE IT ORDAINED by the City of East Point, Georgia, and it is hereby ordained by authority of the same as follows: 
Section 1.  The document entitled the "Code of East Point, Georgia," a copy whereof accompanies this ordinance and is incorporated herein and made a part hereof, is hereby adopted and shall be treated and considered as a new and original comprehensive ordinance. 
Section 2.  All ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature of East Point, Georgia, enacted on final passage on or before September 19, 1977, and not in the code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of this ordinance, except as hereinafter provided. 
Section 3.  The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this ordinance; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution of the city promising or guaranteeing the payment of money by or to the city, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the city, or any evidence of the city's indebtedness, or any contract or obligation assumed by the city; nor shall this repeal affect any rights or franchise granted by any ordinance or resolution of the city to any person, firm or corporation; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution dedicating, naming, establishing, locating, relocating, opening, paving, widening, vacating, etc., any street or public way in the city; nor shall this repeal affect the present annual appropriation of the city; nor shall this repeal affect any ordinance or resolution levying or imposing charges, fees or taxes now due or accrued; nor shall this repeal be construed to revive any ordinance or resolution or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance or resolution which is repealed by this ordinance. 
Section 4.  The provisions appearing in this code, so far as they are the same as provisions of ordinances and resolutions existing at the time of the effective date of this code, are intended, and shall be considered, as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. 
Section 5.  Any and all additions or amendments to the code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated into the code so that reference to the "Code of East Point, Georgia," shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
Section 6.  A copy of the code shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk, and preserved in looseleaf form, or in such other form as the city clerk may consider most expedient.

A copy of the code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine it and shall be considered the official Code of East Point, Georgia. 
Section 7.  As pages of the code are replaced because the matter contained on them shall have been repealed, amended, or otherwise shall have been superseded or rendered obsolete or inoperative, the city clerk shall retain copies of the pages of the code so superseded, rendered obsolete or otherwise rendered inoperative in a file so that the former provisions of the code may be readily available and easily found. The purpose of this section is to permit anyone desiring to do so to ascertain the precise status of any section of the code as of any given date. 
Section 8.  In case of the amendment of any section of the code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in the city charter of the code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein. 
Section 9.  It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of the code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the code in any manner whatsoever which may cause the law of East Point, Georgia to be misrepresented thereby. 
Section 10.  All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed. 
Section 11.  This ordinance shall be in force and take effect on November 17, 1980.

DIVISION I. - CHARTER AND RELATED LOCAL LAWS 
Act No. 174 of the 2007 Georgia General Assembly, signed by the governor on May 18, 2007, enacted a new charter for the City of East Point. Sections of the charter subsequently amended carry a legislative history in parentheses at the end of the affected section(s) denoting the amending legislation. The previous charter of the city derived from Ga. L. 1972, p. 2151, as amended. 
Division I of this code is a compilation of the city charter and related state laws of local application involving the city adopted by the Georgia General Assembly or adopted under home rule by the city along with state constitutional amendments of local application to the city. No state laws of general application are reprinted here but references to those laws are occasionally included in appropriate places. Local acts clearly superseded by general law have been excluded. 
The material included in this division has been arranged by basic acts or according to subject matter. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Any material in brackets has been added to clarify the meaning of the text. At the end of each section appears a reference to the basic act and amendatory acts, if any. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate the use of this compilation and indexing; however, formal citations and references should be to the original act, and not to this compilation. 
Included in this code is a State Laws of Local Application Disposition Table listing chronologically the laws in this division and their location in this code.

The mayor or any councilmember who engages in willful, material violations of provisions of this charter shall be subject to sanction as follows: the Board of Ethics established pursuant to Section 2-508 of this charter shall, in addition to its authority to hear complaints arising under Chapter 5 of Article II of this charter, be empowered to hear complaints against the mayor or any councilmember alleging that such elected official has committed willful, material violations of this charter.

I further swear that I am not the holder of any unaccounted for public money due this state or any political subdivision or authority thereof; that I am not the holder of any office of trust under the government of the United States, any other state, or any foreign state which I am by the laws of the State of Georgia prohibited; that I am otherwise qualified to hold said office according to the Constitution and the laws of Georgia; that I will support the Constitution of the United States and this state and observe the provisions of the charter and code of ordinances of the City of East Point. I further swear that I have been a resident of the City of East Point for the time required by the Constitution and laws of this state and the charter and code of ordinances of the City of East Point. So help me God or so I affirm." They shall file such oath with the city clerk, who shall spread the same upon the minutes of the meeting of the city council of East Point next following such filing, unless such oath is filed during a regular meeting then in session.  
CHAPTER 2. - LEGISLATIVE PROCESS 
 
Sec. 2-201. - Regular and special meetings. 
(a)  Regular meetings of the city council shall be held at such time and place within the city as the city council shall fix by ordinance. Special meetings of the city council may be held on the call of the mayor and two councilmembers or on the call of three councilmembers. Notice of such special meetings shall be served on all other members personally, or by telephone personally, at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a councilmember in writing before or after such a meeting, and attendance shall also constitute a waiver of notice of any business transacted in such councilmember's presence, unless such councilmember attends for the express purpose of objecting to the legality of the notice provided for the meeting and refuses to participate based upon such objection. In the event of an objection regarding the legality of the notice for the special meeting, the city attorney shall make the determination as to whether notice was properly given. Only the business stated in the call may be transacted at the special meeting. 
(b)  The mayor, as presiding officer of the city council, shall have the authority to cancel a meeting of the city council on the grounds of an emergency. Notice of such cancellation shall be served on all councilmembers personally, or by telephone personally, as soon as practical after the emergency event. The mayor shall state the nature of the emergency and reschedule the city council meeting within a reasonable time, not to exceed ten days. Such notice to members shall not be required as to any member who is present when the emergency becomes apparent. Notice to the public shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible in accordance with Code Section 50-14-1 of the O.C.G.A. or such other applicable laws as are or may hereafter be enacted.  
Sec. 2-202. - Investigations and inquiries. 
Following the adoption of an authorizing resolution, the city council may make investigations and inquiries into the affairs of the city and the conduct of any department, office, or agency thereof and, for this purpose, may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony, and require the production of evidence. Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued by the city council in the exercise of these powers shall be punished as provided by ordinance. The initiation and conduct of any investigations or inquiries by the city council under this charter provision shall not be deemed to constitute interference by the city council with the administration of the government by the city manager.  
Sec. 2-203. - Emergencies. 
(a)  To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the city council may convene on call of the mayor or two councilmembers and promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance may not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three councilmembers shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
(b)  Such meetings shall be open to the public to the extent required by law, and notice to the public of emergency meetings shall be made as fully as is reasonably possible in accordance with Code Section 50-14-1 of the O.C.G.A. or such other applicable laws as are or may hereafter be enacted.  
Sec. 2-204. - Rules of procedure. 
The city council shall adopt its rules of procedure and order of business consistent with the provisions of this charter and shall provide for keeping a journal of its proceedings, which shall be a public record. The mayor, as presiding officer, shall serve or otherwise designate the city attorney to serve as parliamentarian for the purposes of ruling on questions of procedure. The mayor or any councilmember may, at any time, question the city attorney as to procedural matters governing the meetings of council. The mayor may designate a police officer of the city to serve as sergeant at arms for the express purpose of maintaining the decorum or order at meetings of city council; however, it will remain within the sole discretion of the presiding officer to rule a councilmember out of order.  
Sec. 2-205. - Decorum. 
It is the intent of this charter provision to encourage decorum, civility, and respect in city council debate. Towards that end, councilmembers shall aspire to the following standards of decorum: 
(1)  In legislative debate, councilmembers shall, to the maximum extent possible, keep their remarks germane to the matter before the city council at that time; and 
(2)  Councilmembers shall refrain from attacking the motives and character of other councilmembers participating in the debate. 
It is not the intent of this provision to, in any way, hinder or impair the full and free expression of competing viewpoints in city council debate. Instead, it is the intent of this provision to foster citizen confidence in government through encouraging civil, respectful meetings.  
Sec. 2-206. - Quorum; voting. 
Five councilmembers and the mayor or six councilmembers shall constitute a quorum and shall be authorized to transact business of the city council. Voting on the adoption of ordinances shall be by voice vote and the vote shall be recorded in the journal or by voting machine and recorded thereby, but any member of the city council shall have the right to request a roll-call vote, and such vote shall be recorded in the journal. Except as otherwise provided in this charter, the affirmative vote of five councilmembers shall be required for the adoption of any ordinance, resolution, or motion.  
Sec. 2-207. - Form of legislation. 
(a)  Every official act of the city council having the force and effect of law shall be by ordinance. All other actions of the city council shall be by resolution. 
(b)  Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing and in the form required for final adoption. Each ordinance which involves lengthy documents not included within the body of such ordinance shall include a reference to such documents. 
(c)  No ordinance shall contain more than one subject matter, which subject shall be clearly expressed in the title of the ordinance. 
(d)  The enacting clause shall be "Be it ordained by the city council of East Point". 
(e)  Any ordinance which repeals or amends an existing ordinance or part of the city code shall set forth the ordinance sections or subsections to be repealed or amended. 
(f)  An ordinance may be introduced by any councilmember at any regular meeting of the city council or at any special meeting at which an ordinance may be lawfully considered and adopted. 
(g)  Each ordinance shall be read by title at two different regular meetings of the city council unless such reading be waived by affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds (2/3) of the council members present at any meeting of the city council duly convened at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that any zoning ordinance, assessing ordinance, or any other ordinance requiring a public hearing shall not be finally adopted until after such ordinance has been properly advertised and a public hearing held thereon.

Following publication of the first code under this charter and at all times thereafter, the ordinances and charter amendments shall be printed in substantially the same style as the code currently in effect and shall be suitable in form for incorporation therein. The city council shall make such further arrangements as deemed desirable with reproduction and distribution of any current changes in or additions to codes of technical regulations and other rules and regulations included in the code.

CHAPTER 4. - RELATIONSHIP AMONG MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL, AND CITY MANAGER. 
 
Sec. 2-401. - Role delineation. 
Based upon the firm belief that the proper, efficient, and effective administration and operation of the city's council-manager form of government will be fostered by a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the city council, mayor, and city manager, this charter provision states the following principles, which are intended to be fully consistent with this article: 
(1)  The full and complete legislative and policy making authority of the city resides in the city council, and the city manager shall take no action which impinges upon or interferes with the city council's policy making role. Other than providing information relevant and germane to the city council's legislative deliberations, the city manager shall strive to remain a neutral party in such legislative deliberations. To ensure the actuality and appearance of neutrality, neither the city manager nor any department heads shall participate in any political activity on behalf of the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices, nor shall the city manager or any department head make any political contribution to the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices. The mayor and councilmembers shall not solicit or accept any campaign contributions from any city employee; 
(2)  The city manager is the chief executive officer of the city, and, as such, all department heads, except the city attorney and city clerk who are appointed by and report to the city council, report to the city manager. The mayor and city council shall observe the management authority of the city manager. 
(A)  The mayor and councilmembers shall not in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of any city administrative officers or employees whom the city manager or any of his or her subordinates are empowered to appoint; 
(B)  Except for the purpose of conducting an investigation or inquiry authorized by the city council pursuant to Section 2-202 of this charter, the mayor and councilmembers shall deal with city officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the city manager solely through the city manager, and neither the mayor nor any councilmembers shall give orders to any such officers or employees either publicly or privately; 
(C)  The mayor and city council shall not give directives to any city officers or employees, other than the city manager, city attorney, and city clerk, regarding any matters including, but not limited to, constituent complaints and complaints regarding the services, operation, or administration of any department or function of city government. Although the mayor and city council shall not be prohibited from communicating with city officers or employees with constituent complaints or concerns, the city manager shall be copied on all such communications; 
(D)  The mayor and councilmembers, unless acting pursuant to a duly authorized investigation or inquiry, shall not discuss in open session the performance of or complaints against any city officer or employee during a city council meeting. This provision is not intended to prevent the mayor or city council from discussing, in general terms, the performance of or any issue relating to any department or function of city government; and 
(E)  It shall be prohibited for the mayor or any councilmember to sit in on personnel and management meetings between the city manager and city employees unless such participation is consented to by the city manager and approved by the city council; and 
(3)  The mayor shall have no management authority or responsibility with respect to the operations and administration of city government; and 
(4)  The mayor and city council, as elected officials, shall possess fundamental oversight duties and responsibilities with respect to all operations and administration of city government, and the city manager shall be responsible and duty bound to facilitate the mayor and city council's oversight function. Once the city council has passed the operating and capital budgets of the city, it shall be the responsibility of the city manager to administer such budgets and to keep the mayor and city council fully informed as to the city's progress against such budgets. The city manager shall provide monthly financial updates on the budgets with year to date information, and such updates shall contain all material information necessary for the mayor and city council to evaluate the financial performance and condition of the city. However, once the city council has appropriated funds in the budget and encumbered such funds through subsequent legislative action, the city manager shall have the authority to administer such budget including contract administration and account payables as part of the management function.  
CHAPTER 5. - ETHICS 
 
Sec. 2-501. - Fiduciary responsibility.

(d)  Transfer of appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year, the city manager may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance among programs within a department, office, or agency.

CHAPTER 4. - ETHICS POLICY[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 016-13, adopted July 1, 2013, repealed the former Ch. 4, §§ 2-40012-4030, and enacted a new Ch. 4 as set out herein. The former Ch. 4 pertained to the same subject matter. Refer to Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 
 
Sec. 2-4001. - Declaration of policy. 
(a)  Our government is a representative democracy. Those who are elected, appointed, hired, volunteer, or campaign to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. The public entrusts its power and resources to its servants to use only in the public interest. Public trust requires public servants to fulfill their public duties faithfully and honestly, and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. Public trust also requires that government be conducted in an open manner, when appropriate, so that the official actions of public servants may be subject to public scrutiny and so that members of the public have access to information upon which decisions and policies affecting them are made; but public trust also requires that government be conducted in a manner which respects the rights of its constituents to privacy and confidentiality. Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; and that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair. 
(b)  It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government. Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. Therefore, dedicated public servants not only act with integrity, but also choose to avoid even lawful activity when the appearance of impropriety would lessen the public's confidence in the integrity of its servants and its system. As a result, sometimes public servants sacrifice opportunities which would be open to them if they were not public servants. 
(c)  Most public servants strive to live by these standards most of the time, but because sometimes some do not, some formal policies are necessary. In adopting these formal policies, this community recognizes that: 
(1)  Public servants are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community do; and 
(2)  Public servants retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights; and 
(3)  It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for public servants to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material and avoidable; and 
(4)  Public servants are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain investments; and 
(5)  In this community it is possible and reasonable to require public servants to engage in employment, professional or business activities and to maintain investments which do not impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the community. 
(d)  Although this chapter is necessary to identify minimum standards below which a public servant's conduct cannot fall without the risk of penalty, it is understood that a healthy ethical environment for the provision of public service cannot be achieved or maintained by mere adherence to minimum standards. Therefore, this chapter also requires that the community provide additional, positive means of encouraging ethical behavior among its public servants. It is also understood that no external activity can replace the internal commitment which motivates those who act ethically. The principal policy which forms the foundation of this chapter is to encourage internal commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports integrity with pride and enthusiasm. 
(e)  A work environment which supports integrity includes public servants who: 
(1)  Recognize with gratitude that the primary reason they hold a public position is to serve the public; and 
(2)  Recognize with pride that they hold their public position because the public trusts them; and 
(3)  Recognize with sadness that the public's trust in government and in them is diminished when any public servant acts unethically; and 
(4)  Recognize with hope that their public service is an opportunity to help restore public trust in their government; and 
(5)  Are fair and impartial, but also courteous and enthusiastic in serving the public and each other in the performance of their duties; and 
(6)  Are adequately educated in the principles of ethics; and 
(7)  Are motivated to pursue ethical ideals which always exceed minimum standards and often achieve the highest standards; and 
(8)  Exemplify ethical conduct; and 
(9)  Encourage ethical practices which protect, advance and promote the public interest; and 
(10)  In speaking about the conduct of those in public service, or in responding to others who speak about it, express approval of positive ethical principles and behavior, and refrain from unjustly disparaging or demeaning those who advocate ethical principles or practice ethical behavior; and 
(11)  Recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically themselves, and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of those with whom they work; and 
(12)  Exercise sound and independent judgment to act ethically in situations where others around them may be inclined to act unethically; and 
(13)  When they observe serious unethical practices, promptly disclose them to appropriate authorities, and encourage others to do the same; and 
(14)  Make and implement decisions and policies through proper channels of the governmental organization; and 
(15)  Insure that those for whose performance they are responsible are aware of minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of disciplinary consequences; and 
(16)  When unethical behavior has been determined by the board, they will make the appropriate recommendation to the appropriate legal authority and the mayor and council. 
(Ord. No. 016-13, 7-1-13)

(Ord. No. 016-13, 7-1-13)  
Sec. 2-4006. - Duties. 
(a)  All public servants must conduct themselves in a manner that is above reproach and avoids even the appearance of impropriety. 
(b)  No public servant or former public servant shall divulge to any unauthorized person confidential information acquired in the course of holding his or her position in advance of the time prescribed by the governing body, administrators, or other applicable law for its release to the public. This includes information acquired that is subject to the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine. 
(c)  All public servants shall respond fully and truthfully to any inquiries by the board in connection with the investigation of an alleged or potential violation of this chapter or the Charter. All public servants shall cooperate fully in any investigation by the board, and shall locate, compile and produce for them such information as they may request, unless the information requested is exempt from disclosure under other applicable law. 
(d)  All public servants have an affirmative duty to report any ethical violations of this chapter or the Charter of which they have knowledge. Any person may report a violation of this chapter by filing an ethics complaint against any person other than a paid employee on the proscribed form with the city clerk, who shall convene an ethics panel for processing of such report. 
(e)  Duty to comply with the law. All public servants shall comply with the Constitution and laws of the United States, the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia, and the Charter and ordinances of the city in the performance of their public duties. In addition to being a violation of other laws, it is also a violation of this chapter for any public servant to: 
(1)  Be convicted of any felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, as that term may be defined by state law, whether or not the crime relates directly to the duties of the public servant's position in public service; or

(5)  Be found guilty of violating any state laws governing lobbying activities conducted by the public servant; or 
(6)  Be found guilty of violating the city's policy prohibiting the possession or consumption by employees of alcohol or any controlled or illegal substance in any city facility, vehicle, or work site, including lunch periods and rest breaks; prohibiting public servants from driving or reporting to work, performing work, or visiting a work site while under the influence of alcohol or any controlled or illegal substance; prohibiting public servants from engaging in the consumption, possession, sale, purchase or transfer of controlled substances; and imposing a duty to provide proof of lawful prescription when requested; to advise a supervisor if the use of prescription drugs may affect a public servant's ability to perform public duties safely and efficiently; or 
(7)  Be found guilty of violating any federal, state or city laws or policies regulating political activity; or 
(8)  Be convicted of habitual violations of other federal, state and local laws. Public servants have an ethical duty to abide by the general laws of the state and city, such as the laws governing driving under the influence, the uniform rules of the road, and offenses involving moral turpitude. Habitual violations of state and city laws may indicate disrespect for the law and may contribute to the erosion of public trust. 
a.  If any person believes that a public servant has been convicted of habitual violations of state, federal, or local laws, and that those convictions contribute to the erosion of public trust, that person may file a written complaint with the city clerk, setting forth the facts upon which the complaint is based. The clerk shall forward a copy of the complaint to the alleged offender and the selected three (3) member panel; and if the panel, in its discretion, decides to hear the complaint, it shall give the person notice and an opportunity to be heard. In the event the panel finds that the alleged offender is guilty of habitual violations of law and that the violations contribute to the erosion of public trust, the panel shall have no power other than to inform the offender and city council of the panel's findings, which may subject the offender to further disciplinary action. Having received such notice, the offender shall violate this chapter if the offender violates the order of the board. 
b.  In addition, the governing body, or city manager, where applicable, acting with the authorization of the governing body, may adopt a policy more precisely describing this general duty of all public servants to comply with specified laws in order to help gain and retain respect for city government. The policy must inform public servants of the circumstances under which, and the procedures by means of which, violations of state and city laws will be deemed violations of the policy. The procedures adopted in connection with the policy must safeguard the Constitutional rights of the public servants who are subject to the policy, including the rights of notice and a hearing. If the city adopts a general policy, public servants have a duty to adhere to that policy. If they fail to do so, and thereafter, in accordance with the procedures established by the policy, are determined to have violated the policy, the violation of the policy by the public servants shall also constitute a violation of this provision of this chapter. 
(9)  No member of the governing body shall use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any benefits to him or her or to his or her immediate family, or for those with whom the member has business or financial ties. 
(10)  No member of the governing body shall use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, a city employee, an appointed official of the city, or a contract employee to provide any benefit to him or her or to persons in his or her immediate family.

(c)  No public servant shall accept or receive, directly or indirectly, from any person, including one whose identity is unknown to the public servant, any personal benefit under circumstances in which it can reasonably be inferred that the benefit is intended to influence the public servant in the performance or nonperformance of any official duty or as a reward for any official action of the public servant.

This provision shall not: 
(1)  Prohibit the disclosure of any such information to incumbent public servants to whose duties the information may be pertinent; or 
(2)  Prevent any public servant from reporting violations of this chapter, the Charter or other illegal acts to the proper authorities; or

If a public servant who has a conflict of interest in a matter is present as a member of a body which is to consider the matter, the public servant shall leave his or her regular seat as a member of the body, and not return to it until deliberation and action on the matter is completed. 
(b)  Nothing herein shall require members of voting bodies to leave their seats while action is taken regarding any item contained on a "consent agenda" on which there is no deliberation, the public servant's conflict has been disclosed, and the public servant abstains from voting on the item.

(a)  A governing body member who has or may have, a conflict of interest in a matter which requires an official action by any decision maker, shall, before the matter is decided, disclose the conflict of interest or the potential or alleged conflict of interest; if the member of the governing body believes that no conflict of interest exists, or that despite any alleged or potential special interest, such governing body member is nevertheless able to vote and otherwise participate fairly, objectively and in a manner consistent with the public interest, then the member shall so state in the written disclosure.

If the ethics panel or board determines that the attorney has a personal interest in the matter, or if the city attorney determines that the city attorney's office cannot resolve the conflict in a manner which will allow the city attorney's office to perform its duties properly in the matter, another attorney shall be selected by the city attorney to assist ethics panel.

Sec. 4-1019. - Decision of hearing officer/panel.

If the decision of the hearing officer/panel is in favor of the employee on appeals of dismissal, suspension or demotion, the employee shall be reinstated in accordance with the decision to the classification from which the employee was removed.

The employee shall receive payment as if there had been no break in service, minus any amount earned by or paid to the employee from other employment and wage substitutions, including but not limited to unemployment compensation, during the period off the job and minus any amount paid the employee for annual leave. Sick and annual leave shall be restored to the employee in the same amount that existed at the time of the appealed action, plus sick and annual leave that would have been earned for the period if the employee had actually been in service. However, any period of postponement or continuance of the hearing for the convenience of the employee shall be excluded from any payment of benefits due, and this period of time shall be considered as if the employee had been on leave without pay. Prior to any payment to the employee, the employee shall certify under oath the amount of any income received from other employment and any wage substitutes received during the period off the job, which shall be deducted from the backpay owed by the city. 
(d)  The decision of the hearing officer/panel under this division shall not limit the right of either party to judicial review, and such decision shall be stayed by the filing of a petition for review. Any party, including the city or any city department, who has exhausted all administrative remedies available before the board and who is aggrieved by a final decision or order of the board on any hearing may seek judicial review of the final decision or order of the board in the superior court of Fulton County by writ of certiorari.

(3)  Assignment of overtime. 
a.  Assignment of overtime must be managed such that the work is performed by the least number of employees needed to accomplish the task required, and should be performed by the employees at the lowest rate of pay who have the required skills and experience to perform the mission critical tasks. 
b.  Overtime paid per employee must be documented with justification for the overtime as mission critical, and this documentation must be made available upon request for management review. 
(b)  Compensatory time. 
(1)  For employees hired on or after September 1, 2002, compensatory time, or time off in lieu of overtime, may be granted for overtime hours worked. These hours worked over the maximum regular hours allowed in each work period (forty (40) hours for employees except fire personnel) will be accrued at the rate of time and one-half (½) of the employee's regular pay rate. For employees hired before September 1, 2002, compensatory time may be taken in place of overtime at the employee's discretion. 
(2)  Employees who accrue overtime earned as comp-time may be required to take comp-time at a time when city services will not be seriously affected, as determined by the department head. The maximum accrued comp-time per employee is two hundred forty (240) hours for general employees and four hundred eighty (480) hours for fire and police personnel. All overtime earned after the maximum comp-time accrual is reached must be paid as overtime pay. Any accrued and unused comp-time must be paid in full when the employee ceases to be employed by the city.

The fact that any member of the board is a member of the city council, or employee of east point, or a participant, shall not disqualify him from doing any act or thing which the plan authorizes or requires him to do as a member of such board (except as otherwise provided in section 4-1120 with respect to a member who is a participant).

(b)  A certified copy of the resolution of the council making such amendment shall be delivered to the trustee; the plan shall be amended in the manner and effective as of the date set forth in such resolution; and the employees, inactive participants, beneficiaries, trustee, and all others having any interest under the plan shall be bound thereby. 
(Ord. eff. 1-1-01, § 7.01)  
Sec. 4-1133. - Termination of the plan. 
(a)  Employer may terminate plan: The employer shall have the right, by action of the city council, in their sole and final discretion, to terminate the plan at any time.

Upon such termination or discontinuance, there shall be set aside in a separate account an amount estimated by the board to be adequate to defray all costs and charges (including those of legal counsel, actuary, and trustee) associated with the plan termination. From the trust fund remaining, the amount of the accrued retirement benefits shall be deemed to have been funded in the following order of priorities: 
(1)  All participants' contributions with interest payable under the plan to the date of termination of the plan. 
(2)  All participants who, prior to the termination of the plan, have retired or died or have elected phased retirement, and who, or their beneficiaries, are already receiving benefits and participants who are continuing employment under the delayed retirement provisions. 
(3)  All participants who, prior to termination of the plan, were eligible for early or normal but not delayed retirement benefits. 
(4)  All participants who, prior to termination of the plan, were one hundred (100) percent vested in their benefits. 
(5)  All remaining participants with accrued retirement benefits. 
(6)  All contingent beneficiaries entitled to death benefits only upon the deaths of participants who are living at the time the plan is terminated. 
Benefits payable under any of the items listed above shall be properly adjusted to reflect any benefits payable under any prior item. 
In the event the trust fund is insufficient to fully fund the accrued retirement benefits (to the date of such termination or discontinuance) for all participants in any class, then such accrued retirement benefits shall be deemed to have been funded in the proportion which the then actuarially determined present value of the accrued retirement benefits for each participant in such class bears to the then actuarially determined present value of the accrued retirement benefits for all participants in such class. 
(d)  Methods of satisfying obligations: Upon termination of the plan, the board shall determine, and so direct the trustee, the method, from among the following methods of discharging and satisfying all obligations (in the order of priorities specified above) on behalf of participants: 
(1)  By continuation of the trust and the payment therefrom of benefits as they become due in accordance with the provisions of the plan in effect immediately prior to its termination; or 
(2)  By annuities payable through the media of annuity contracts purchased from an insurance company; or 
(3)  By the liquidation and distribution of the assets of the trust fund; or 
(4)  By any combination of such methods. 
(e)  Repayment to employer: After the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan, any overpayments made by the employer into the trust fund as a result of erroneous actuarial computations shall be repaid to the employer.

a.  Creates or recognizes the existence of an alternative payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefit payable to a participant under the plan; 
b.  Clearly specified (A) the name and last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order, (B) the amount of percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid by the plan to each alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined, (C) the number of payments or the period to which the order applies and (D) each plan to which the order applies; and 
c.

(3)  After receipt of a domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall (1) promptly notify the affected participant and any alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan's procedure for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders and (2) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, determine whether the order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination. 
(4)  The board shall establish a procedure to determine the qualified status of domestic relations order and to administer plan distributions in accordance with qualified domestic relations orders. Such procedure shall be in writing, shall include a provision specifying the notification requirements enumerated in the preceding paragraph, shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of communications from the plan administrator and shall include such other provision as the plan administrator determines, consistent with Code Sections 401(a)(13) and 414(p). 
(5)  During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise), the plan administrator shall segregate in a separate account under the plan the amount, if any which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.

If no further benefits are payable to the participant or beneficiary under the plan, the board, in its discretion, may employ such means as are available under applicable law to recover the excess benefit amount from the participant, beneficiary or other recipient.

CODE 415 LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS 
 
Sec. 4-1147. - Code 415 limitations on benefits attributable to employer contributions. 
(a)  Basic limitation on benefit. Notwithstanding any provision in the plan to the contrary and except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, the annual benefit payable to a participant under the plan and any other defined benefit plans maintained by an affiliate, to the extent attributable to employer contributions, shall not exceed the defined benefit dollar limitation. 
(b)  Exception. The limitations under subsection (a) shall not apply if the participant's annual benefit attributable to employer contributions under the plan or any other defined benefit plans maintained by an affiliate does not in the aggregate exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000). 
(c)  Adjustments to basic limitation. 
(1)  Adjustment for early retirement. If a participant's benefit under the plan commences before age sixty-two (62), the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age (62) (adjusted under subsections (3) and/or (4) below, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age prior to age sixty-two (62) is determined as the lesser of (i) the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in section 1.02 of the plan and (ii) the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using a five-percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table as defined in section 1.02 of the plan. Any decrease in the defined benefit. 
Dollar limitation determined in accordance with this subsection (1) shall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 
To the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Service, the above limitations do not apply to police officers and firefighters. 
(2)  Adjustment for deferred retirement. If a participant's benefit under the plan commences after age sixty-five (65), the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be adjusted (in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) so that it is the actuarial equivalent (determined using the applicable interest rate and mortality table under Code Section 417 (e)(3)) of a benefit equal to the defined benefit dollar limitation commencing at age sixty-five (65). 
(3)  Adjustment for less than ten years credited service. If a participant has completed less than ten (10) years credited service the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's number of years (or part thereof) of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(4)  Adjustment for less than ten (10) years of vesting service. If a participant has completed less than ten (10) years of vesting service, the limitation referred to in subsection (a) and the exception described in subsection (b) shall be adjusted by multiplying the amounts described in such limitation and exception by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's number of years of service (or part thereof) and the denominator of which is ten (10).

A limitation as adjusted under Code Section 415(d) will apply to the first limitation year ending after December 31, 2001. 
(b)  Defined benefit plan. The term "defined benefit plan" shall mean any qualified retirement plan maintained by an affiliate, which is not a defined contribution plan. 
(c)  Limitation year. The term "limitation year" shall mean the twelve-month period ending on December 31, which period shall be the "limitation year" for purposes of Code Section 415.

Provided, that the purchasing agent may waive the requirement of three (3) offerors upon the written determination that three (3) firms are not available to perform the proposed professional or consultant services.

(2)  Determination of nonresponsibility: If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility setting forth the basis of the finding shall be prepared by the purchasing agent. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to supply prompt information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility.

(2)  Amount of bid security: Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least five (5) percent of the amount of the bid. Unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to the return of the bid security.

Nothing herein prevents the requirement of such bonds on supply or service contracts under one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) when the circumstances warrant. The purchasing agent is authorized to reduce or waive payment bonds on contracts for professional or consultant services when the purchasing agent determines it is in the best interests of the city. 
(3)  Authority to require additional bonds: Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the city to require a performance or payment bond or other security in addition to those bonds, or in circumstances other than those specified in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

(5)  Suits on payment bonds where and when brought: Every suit instituted upon a payment bond shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for the county or district in which the contract for equipment, supplies, services, construction, and professional or consultant services was to be performed; but no such suit shall be commenced after the expiration of one (1) year after the day on which the last of the labor was performed or material was supplied by the person bringing suit.

In this chapter: 
Mediation means a process whereby a neutral third person called a "mediator" acts to encourage and facilitate the resolution of a dispute between two (2) or more parties. It is an informal and nonadversarial process with the objective of helping the disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable and voluntary agreement. In mediation, decision-making authority rests with the parties. The role of the mediator includes, but is not limited to, assisting the parties in identifying issues, fostering joint problem-solving, and exploring settlement alternatives. 
(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94)  
Sec. 4-5002. - Policies. 
It is the policy of the city to encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes through the process of mediation.

(b)  In addition, the city or its officials may on its own motion or the motion of a party, refer to mediation any matter whereby an aggrieved employee or third party asserts a claim against the city or any of its employees or officials. However, such referrals shall be made only in the sole discretion of the city and only with the consent of the aggrieved party and shall further be made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Such claim shall be screened by the city either on its own or in cooperation with a mediator to determine whether the claim is appropriate for mediation. 
(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94)

Furthermore, if the city determines that a third party's claim is appropriate for referral to mediation, the city shall notify the aggrieved party of its determination and shall actively encourage the third party to agree to submit the matter to mediation in accordance with the provisions of this Code. The notice letter shall contain a brief statement advising the aggrieved party that, in the event the matter is ultimately submitted to mediation, each party shall be responsible for the payment of one-half (½) of the costs associated with the mediators' services and that each party shall be solely responsible for their own attorney fees, if any, incurred in relation thereto. 
(b)  The aggrieved party may, at any time after its receipt of the notice under subsection 4-5004(a), notify the city in writing of its objection to the referral. 
(c)  In the event the third party objects to the referral, the city may not refer the dispute to mediation. In the event the third party agrees to submit the dispute to mediation, the city shall go forward with such submittal in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Sec. 4-5007. - Standards and duties of mediator.

If, through the mediation process, the parties reach a settlement and execute a written agreement disposing of the dispute, the agreement is enforceable in the same manner as any other written agreement.

Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the business tax division and no special form is required except that the taxpayer set forth sufficient information for the determination of the appeal.

The planning and zoning director or his/her designee shall act on such appeals only when submitted by the taxpayer, an attorney acting directly on the behalf of a taxpayer or from a person who presents a signed and notarized power of attorney that they are authorized to represent the taxpayer. 
(1)  The filing of an appeal as to the amount of tax due shall not act to relieve the taxpayer of the requirement to pay the amount of tax levied or to prevent the imposition of penalties and interest. The filing of an appeal of the amount of tax calculated to be due follows a separate procedure from a claim for refund and taxpayers are hereby put on notice that the filing of an appeal of the determination of the amount of tax due is not a claim for refund and does not preserve any rights of the taxpayer with respect the time limits within which refunds must be claimed under state law. 
(2)  The planning and zoning director or his/her designee shall make a written determination on all appeals, except for claims for refunds, within six (6) months of its filing. Other than a refund claim, any appeal, not acted on within six (6) months is deemed denied.

(4)  Any appeal concerning the issuance of executions shall be governed in the manner set forth by state law. 
(b)  Any claim for refund of any tax provided for in this chapter shall be subject to the provisions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-380 as it exists now or as it may be amended. 
(1)  Any claim for refund of any tax provided for in this chapter shall be in writing and shall be addressed, by the taxpayer, to the planning and zoning director or his/her designee, who is herein designated by the city council to accept claims for refunds. The claim shall identify the taxpayer, specify the business location, the tax years for which refunds are claimed and the dates of payment for which the refund is claimed. The claim shall also include a summary statement of the grounds on which the taxpayer relies and shall specify the tax years and dates of payments to which such grounds apply. In the event that the taxpayer desires a conference or hearing before the planning and zoning director or his/her designee in connection with any claim for refund, the taxpayer shall so specify in writing at the time of filing the claim. The planning and zoning director or his/her designee shall grant a conference at a time of his/her convenience except in those cases where the city council must hear the claim. 
(2)  The date of filing shall be the date that the claim for refund is received by the planning and zoning director or his/her designee. In any case where the planning and zoning director or his/her designee does not make a refund for any or the entire amount claimed, or cause the refund claim to appear on the agenda city council, within one year of the date that the claim is received, the taxpayer may consider that the claim is denied. No claim shall be deemed approved by the failure of the planning and zoning director or his/her designee to make a decision on the claim or to failure of the claim to appear on the agenda of the city council. The planning and zoning director or his/her designee and the taxpayer may agree in writing to extend the one year period for processing of the claim and such action shall stay the presumption of denial until the written agreement expires. 
(3)  In cases of error, clerical or otherwise, the city council shall approve or disapprove the claim through a resolution which shall also be considered at least once at a meeting of the city council, prior to a final vote. In such cases where the taxpayer has requested a hearing before the governing authority, such hearing shall take place at said committee meeting. 
(c)  Further proceedings concerning the denial of refund claims shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-380 as it may be from time to time amended.

PRELIMINARY PERMIT. 
For such preliminary blasting permit, anyone seeking same shall first post a bond or a certified copy of a liability insurance policy in the minimum amount of $50,000 property damage per individual per occurrence, $100,000 aggregate property damage per occurrence and $300,000 bodily injury per person per occurrence with an aggregate bodily injury of $300,000 per occurrence or in such additional amount as may be deemed necessary by the fire chief, said bond or insurance policy shall be in a form payable for any damages arising from such preliminary test explosions and all damages arising from subsequent blasting operations if the production blasting permit issues. 
Before commencing initial test explosions a survey shall be conducted of all structures (where permitted by owner) contiguous to the blasting area and also other structures possibly endangered, based on location and/or condition. Color photographs are to be taken of typical conditions in each structure to reflect its condition prior to blasting. All exposed structures shall be carefully protected from the effects of the blasts and all blasts shall be covered with blasting mats, dirt, heavy timbers or other suitable material. The blasting shall be done by experienced workmen. Any damage done shall be promptly repaired by the contractor at his own expense. All blasting supplies shall be stored in a manner approved by the State Fire Marshal and a watchman shall be stationed at all times at the place of the storage. 
Care shall be taken for the initial test explosions and all subsequent explosions to minimize ground vibrations with a maximum peak particle velocity, as measured at the nearest structure, not to exceed 2.0 inches per second. The over pressure (noise or concussion) shall be minimized and sufficient stemming and matting used to prevent over pressure in excess of 120 db. Precaution shall be taken to minimize flying rock and sufficient matting used to prevent rocks from striking any person or structure. 
The preliminary permit shall be issued for the purposes of making initial test explosions at which time vibration recording instruments shall be used on the initial test explosions, and all others deemed necessary to determine proper blasting procedures. These instruments shall be of the type which records on direct-reading tape the three (3) components of velocity. The analysis of these recordings are to be signed by a registered, professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia. The tapes and all other recorded documentary information are to be filed with the Fire Department at the time of making application for the blasting permit. Blasting is not to be conducted which will produce a scale distance less than previously recorded for at least three (3) different explosions deemed to be safe. The scale distance is to be determined by the distance from the shot to the nearest structure subject to potential damage from ground vibrations. 
Overpressure (concussion) is to be recorded on a direct recording tape, preferably at the same recording as the vibration. The instrument used for measuring concussion shall be the type specifically designed for impact type overpressure from explosions. 
For initial test shots under the preliminary blasting permits, care shall be taken to assure that ground vibrations with a maximum peak particle velocity, as measured at the nearest structure, do not exceed 1.0 inches per second. 
In the initial testing phase of explosion or blasting operations, prior to instrumentation, a scale distance of fifty (50) for residential structures, and a scale distance of twenty-five (25) for commercial and engineered structures or Numerically greater may be used to determine the maximum charge weight per delay interval of seventeen milliseconds or greater. (NOTE: A commercial or engineered structure to qualify for the scaled distance limitation of twenty-five (25) under the above regulation is one in which the load bearing frame is of steel or reinforced concrete with no inclusions of wall or ceilings for residential type construction, i.e., plastic walls or ceilings supported by studs or joist or rafters of wood, commonly associated with what is commonly known as "carpenter construction." All scale distance and blasting shall conform with standards and formulations set forth in table 1, attached hereto. 
All blast testing vibration and seismographic equipment shall conform to the standards and procedures set forth in table 2, attached hereto and which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
For preliminary testing, blasting and all production blasting, records shall be maintained in conformance with the information required on Table 3, attached hereto and which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
All blasting, whether preliminary testing or production blasting, shall conform with the safety standards set forth on Table 4, attached hereto and which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
Upon completion of tests, blasting and after certification by an engineer, it shall be submitted to the Fire Department of the City of East Point for approval and issuance of a production blasting permit and setting of a bond and/or liability insurance policy. It is required before the issuance of a production blasting permit that said bond or certified copy of liability blasting insurance be filed with the Fire Chief of the City of East Point. Said bond or blasting liability insurance policy shall on its face become payable for payment for any damages arising from such permitted blasting. Upon furnishing of all of said items and establishment of the amount of the bond or blasting liability insurance policy, the Fire Chief of the City of East Point shall issue a production blasting permit." 
TABLE 1 
DEFINITIONS 
1.  SCALED DISTANCE is defined as the product obtained by dividing the distance (in feet) to the nearest building structure by the square root of the weight of explosive per time delay in pounds. 
2.  BLASTER is any person who, engaging in a blasting operation decides hole size, spacing, or depth; decides total quantity of explosive; decides quantity of explosive in each hole; and/or decides timing delays to be used. Such person must be present when the charge is detonated and either physically detonates the charge or gives the order to detonate the charge. 
BLASTING STANDARDS 
A.  In all blasting operations, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the maximum peak particle velocity of the ground motion in any direction shall not exceed two inches per second at the immediate location of any dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building. 
B.  This ground velocity limit is not construed to mean on property owned, leased, or contracted by the blaster or blaster's company or on property on which the owner gives a written waiver. 
C.  No two consecutive subcharges within any charge shall be separated by a time delay of less than seventeen milliseconds. 
D.  The standard table for the maximum charge per delay period shall be for distances greater than 300 feet generated by the following formula: 
W =( D / 50 ) 2 
Where W is the weight of explosive in lbs and D is the distance to the nearest dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building in feet. On sites where the City decides it necessary to comply with the provisions of the law this formula may be altered. 
E.  For the purpose of well shooting below 100 ft., the table shall be generated by the following formula: 
W =( D / 50 ) 3 
Where W is the total weight of explosives in the hole and D is the distance from the charge to the nearest dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial institutional building. 
F.  If on a particular site the peak ground particle continuously exceeds ½ inch per second after a period of one (1) second following the maximum ground particle velocity, the City shall require the total time delay of blasting operations to be less than 200 milliseconds or the charge per delay be reduced so that this limit is complied with. 
G.  For distances less than 300 feet, the following table shall be used: 
ACTUAL DISTANCE IN FEET 	POUNDS PER DELAY INTERVAL OF 8 MILLISECONDS OR GREATER 
 5-10 	1/8 lb. 
11-15 	¼ lb. 
16-20 	½ lb. 
21-25 	¾ lb. 
26-30 	1.0 lb. 
31-300 	1 lb. + 1/8 lb. for each foot of distance above 30 feet. 
 
Less than 5 feet the total charge should not exceed 1/8 lb. 
TABLE 2 
TESTING EQUIPMENT 
A.  If a blaster decides that the table provided by the City is too conservative, or limiting, he may on 15 days notification to the Department of Mines and Minerals use seismograph measurements and increase the charge per delay period, provided the velocity of 2 inches per second limit is not violated. He must use the seismograph on every shot thereafter so long as the table is not being complied with. If the blaster decides to return to the use of the table, he may do so by notifying the department 15 days in advance. 
B.  If a blaster considers the table too limiting or too conservative, for his particular area, he may upon submission of seismograph reports, petition for a modified table for blasting operation at that particular site but in no case shall the department allow a table that would permit velocities above the 2 inch per second limit. 
C.  In making a seismograph determination of the velocity at a particular position, the following formula shall be used: 
V = V o D<inf>o</inf> / D 1.5 
Where V o is the maximum ground particle velocity at the seismograph, D o is the distance from the blast, and D is the distance from the blast to the position in question and in the same general direction. The distance D o may not be greater than D, and D cannot be more than five (5) times D o . This determined velocity at the site of any dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building shall not exceed the two (2) inches per second limit. 
D.  In seismic tests for compliance or petition, the analysis of seismic data shall be conducted by a completely independent company, one not related to the company performing the blasting or for whom the blasting is being performed, under the direction of a professional engineer registered in Georgia. 
E.  A direct reading velocity instrument shall be approved only if it has a frequency range of 5 cycles per second to 150 cycles per second or greater, a velocity range from zero to 2.0 in/sec. or greater, adheres to design criteria for portable seismographs as outlined in USBM RI-5708, USBM RI-6487. 
F.  Instruments of both the direct reading velocity type and the displacement type are approved for use as follows: 
(1)  Particle velocity reading may be calculated from results obtained by a displacement instrument or obtained from an approved direct reading velocity instrument in any blasting operation where all of the following conditions exist: 
(a)  Recording distance is over 200 feet from the blast; 
(b)  Scaled distance is numerically greater than 25; 
(c)  Frequency range is 40 cycles per second or less. 
(2)  A direct reading velocity instrument will be required in any blasting operation where all of the following conditions exist: 
(a)  Recording distance is less than 200 ft. from the blast; 
(b)  Scaled distance is numerically less than 50.

(a)  New construction. Before covering with earth and before placing a pretreatment system into service, a person/company installing or constructing any portion of a pretreatment system shall notify the city prior to completion of the construction activities and shall have the system inspected by the city for compliance with the requirements of this division. A final inspection fee will be required. The city shall make every reasonable effort to make a complete inspection of system construction, modification, replacement or alteration within two (2) working days after notification to the city that the system is ready for inspection. A repair shall be inspected by the city to determine compliance with construction permit standards prior to final covering of the system. If the system constructed is approved by the city, an "inspection approval" notice will be given to the installer. If the system installation does not pass the construction inspection, then the installer shall make all required corrections and notify the city within seven (7) days for a re-inspection of the system. A re-inspection fee shall be charged to the installer for additional inspection(s) if the contractor has failed to correct the items an inspector has required at the preliminary inspection. Final installation approval shall not be granted until the city has confirmed that the installation is in compliance with plans and specifications submitted with the permit application. If no final construction inspection can be documented of the commercial waste generators pretreatment system, then the certificate of occupancy on the project will not be released. 
(b)  Existing pretreatment systems. The city will perform an annual inspection of all pretreatment systems permitted to operate in the city. The inspections will be conducted to make sure the commercial waste generator is following the maintenance criteria set forth in this division and the waste generator is operating under the conditions of the permit. Those facilities found in non-compliance will be required to correct all violations within seven (7) days of notification. However, if the violation requires a repair, replacement or installation of a pretreatment system, then the commercial waste generator will have forty-five (45) days to comply. All repairs, replacement and installations will require approval by the city. 
(Ord. No. 008-07, § VII, 3-19-07)  
Sec. 8-2358. - Right of entry; inspection and sampling. 
The office of government operations shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Office of Government Operations will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The office of government operations shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The office of government operations may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least monthly to ensure their accuracy and records of calibrations shall be kept and made available to the office of government operations upon request. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the office of government operations and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the office of government operations for access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
(Ord. No. 008-07, § 8, 3-19-07)  
Sec. 8-2359. - Location and installation. 
(a)  Pretreatment systems will be located and installed as close as reasonably possible to the discharge source of the commercial waste. 
(b)  A subsurface pretreatment system must be located or installed no more than fifty (50) feet from the discharge source. A subsurface pretreatment system installed beyond fifty (50) feet must have approval by the city. 
(c)  Pretreatment systems will be located and installed so that proper maintenance of the system does not create sanitary nuisances or health hazards and does not impact the environment. 
(d)  Pretreatment systems must be located and installed so that they are accessible for maintenance. No heavy kitchen equipment, canisters, dumpster or trash compactor can block access to the pretreatment system. 
(e)  Interior grease traps will be installed at the point source such as a 3-4 compartment sink, dishwasher, or any kitchen equipment where grease must be collected prior to discharge to building waste line. Interior grease traps will be located above the floor. Recessed grease traps must have prior approval for installation. All interior grease traps must have a flow control valve and a vent. The flow control valve shall be placed on the inlet side of the grease trap. The vent line will take all odors out of the building. 
(f)  Pretreatment systems installed and located that experience a rusting of parts (e.g. pretreatment system located under a kitchen sink) which may impair the opening of the system for inspection, will require the commercial waste generator to provide access to the system. If the commercial waste generator cannot provide access, then they will be in violation. Inspector can require the unit replaced if it has deteriorated from corrosion. 
(g)  Pretreatment systems installed and located to the outside of a building will discharge to the sanitary sewer line. The test manhole is the last discharge point of the pretreatment system before the sanitary sewer. The sanitary sewer connection from the pretreatment system will not be allowed to connect to the site sanitary sewer line by going under or through the building. The connection to the sanitary sewer line must be kept to the exterior of the building structure. The connection from the building to the pretreatment system will be a direct straight line. One ninety (90) or (45) degree angle will be allowed with a clean out if a straight line is not obtainable. The test manhole will be located a maximum of four (4) feet from the last tank in the pretreatment system and must have an invert in the test manhole. Prefab concrete or brick construction is allowed. 
(h)  All pretreatment systems installed subsurface in multi-level parking decks must be located on the ground level of the structure and must be located so they are accessible for maintenance and inspection. 
(i)  Installation of alternative interior pretreatment system will be allowed for commercial waste generators where an upgrade, repair, or installation of a pretreatment system is required and a subsurface system is not possible. However, the commercial waste generator must meet the following criteria for an alternative pretreatment system to be installed: 
(1)  The facility must be located in an existing building structure fifteen (15) years or older, where written documentation is submitted by a licensed engineer, contractor or master plumber to verify a subsurface pretreatment system is impossible to install due to existing under ground utilities; 
(2)  The facility is not located in new commercial development; 
(3)  The facility provides written documentation by a licensed engineer, contractor or master plumber that the sanitary sewer tie in of a subsurface pretreatment cannot be reached by the installer: 
(4)  The facility's pretreatment system is found to be inadequate and an alternative system will upgrade the current pretreatment system to bring the facility into compliance. 
(j)  Any subsurface pretreatment system requiring installation of more than one single tank will lace the tanks in tandem; one single line. The multiple tanks must be installed so the commercial waste from the building will flow from tank to tank. The distance from tank to tank will not be greater than twelve (12) inches. 
(Ord. No. 008-07, § IX, 3-19-07)  
Sec. 8-2360. - Design of pretreatment system. 
Oil water separators grease traps, and sand traps will be required for commercial and industrial establishments as a pretreatment system where it is determined by the city that they are necessary to prevent oil and grease waste discharge to the sanitary sewer system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the sewer system. The user shall submit plans to the city for review and comment. The installation shall be subject to the city's inspection prior to placing in service. 
(1)  Subsurface pretreatment systems shall comply with the structural requirements as indicated on the East Point standard (available from the public works department) and this division. All subsurface pretreatment systems must comply with the engineering standards indicated on the standard detail, as well as the current plumbing code used by the city.

DIVISION 1. - INTRODUCTION 
 
Sec. 8-2401. - Findings. 
The city council of the City of East Point, Georgia makes the following findings: 
(a)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, prepared by experts for the city, properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding sources of the city. 
(b)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of East Point. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of East Point is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(c)  The stormwater needs in the City of East Point include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of East Point in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses. However, the service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
(d)  The City of East Point presently owns, operates, and provides regulatory control regarding certain stormwater management systems, which have been developed over many years and include features such as inlets, conduits, channels, swales, ditches, drainage easements, and other natural waterways. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and/or operated and/or regulated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in East Point in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(e)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analyses, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in East Point in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(f)  The city council recognizes that lack of maintenance of a stormwater management system creates adverse conditions to both private and public elements of the management and conveyance system and to properties that are dependent upon such conveyances for effective management of stormwater runoff. 
(g)  The city council finds, concludes and determines that a stormwater management utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly funding stormwater management services in the City of East Point and implementing all of the city's stormwater management-related ordinances. 
(h)  An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city. Such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods, which address specific needs, including but not limited to, allocations of special purpose local options sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects. A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city. Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. In addition, the value to the stormwater management utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater management utility customers may be recognized by credits. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2402. - Definitions. 
Bond shall mean an evidence of indebtedness including, but not limited to, a bond, a note, an obligation, a loan agreement, a financing lease, a financing agreement or other similar instrument or agreement.

(3)  Amounts necessary to fund bond debt service reserves; or 
(4)  Any obligations lawfully issued or otherwise contracted for by the city as may be provided in any resolution authorizing such obligations or in any trust instrument relating to such obligations. 
City of East Point Stormwater Management System shall consist of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, sidewalks, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the City of East Point which control and/or convey stormwater in and through the city, but shall exclude such stormwater management systems which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City of East Point and for which there has been no public dedication to the city and for which operation, maintenance, and/or improvement responsibilities have not been accepted through action of the city council in writing. 
Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the director, department of public works in accordance with the city's Stormwater Management Credit and Adjustment Manual approved by action of the mayor and city council. 
Customers of the stormwater management utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program.

Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
Developed land shall mean all real property altered from its natural state by grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures, impervious services, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped condition. 
Director, department of public works is the individual at East Point that has direct responsibility for the management of the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and the stormwater management utility. In the event that the Director is otherwise committed, a designee appointed by director will be responsible for activities as set forth in this article. 
Duplexes and triplexes shall mean developed land containing two (2) (duplex) or three (3) (triplex) attached residential dwelling units located on one (1) or more parcels of land. 
Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
Impervious means not allowing the passage of water through the surface of the ground or ground covering or a substantial reduction in the capacity for water to pass through the surface of the ground or ground covering as it would under natural conditions. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious" for purposes of the stormwater management utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone- paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater into soil or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
Multiple dwelling unit residential properties shall mean developed land where on four (4) or more attached residential dwelling units are located and shall include, but not limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, and other structures in which four or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. 
Other developed land shall mean, but shall not be limited to, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, churches and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants. 
Service charges shall mean the periodic rate, fee, or charge applicable to a parcel of land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the City of East Point Stormwater Management Utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater management utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
Single family unit (SFU) is defined to serve as a reference point for comparing dissimilar properties and attaining an equitable distribution of the cost of services and facilities through a stormwater service fee. The SFU in East Point shall be determined through engineering and analysis, subject to approval by the city council. This unit shall be expressed in terms of square feet of impervious area, and will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all developed properties within East Point. 
Stormwater management systems shall include the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and private systems consisting of facilities, operations, and programs that address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of stormwater runoff and receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. This definition is not intended to supersede more specific definitions that may be found in other stormwater management ordinances in the city's Code of Ordinances, wherein the term's definition is varied in accordance with its use in a particular context. 
Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

Sec. 8-2421. - Declaration of public nuisance with regard to privately owned stormwater conveyance systems. 
Lack of maintenance of a stormwater management system located on private property creates adverse conditions impacting other private and public properties which are dependent upon these systems for stormwater runoff. The city recognizes that stormwater management systems on private property and private easements which are in neglected condition, with excessive vegetation or blocked pipes, ditches, swales or other conveyances, impede stormwater flow and cause adverse impacts to adjacent and upstream public and private property. The city finds that private stormwater management systems which are not adequately maintained, are collapsing, or otherwise impede or block the flow of stormwater constitute a public nuisance and a threat to public health, safety, and welfare. The city further finds that prompt abatement of inadequate maintenance of such private stormwater management systems is in the public interest. Any blocked conveyance condition or other condition that otherwise impedes or prevents a normal flow or design flow of stormwater into, through, or out of a private stormwater management system and which may cause flooding of other properties, public or private, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and is prohibited. Ditches and swales which are determined to contain excessive vegetation and which may cause flooding of other properties, public or private, are hereby declared to be a public nuisance and are prohibited. Failure of property owners and developers of real property within the city to provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, discharge stormwater in a safe manner and in accordance with this article shall constitute a nuisance. A determination that such a condition exists shall be made by the director, department of public works or his designee. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2422. - Inspections. 
(a)  Right of entry. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees, bearing proper credentials and identification, to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests, including sample collection using state-approved test methodologies, thereon in order to assure compliance with this article. Inspections may be made as part of a neutral inspection scheme or if reasonable cause exists for such inspection(s). 
(b)  No creation of duty. No affirmative obligation shall exist, nor should one be construed to be created, to address all drainage failures or other malfunctions of the City of East Point Stormwater Management System, whether discovered through an inspection or otherwise. The mayor and city council retain sole discretion to determine if the costs to the city for such repair are justified by a corresponding benefit to the public. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2423. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
(b)  Notice of violation. Whenever the director, department of public works finds that a violation of this ordinance has occurred, the director, department of public works may order compliance by written notice of violation.

DIVISION 5. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY 
 
Sec. 8-2450. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater management utility in the City of East Point to provide for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems in accordance with the scope of responsibility for stormwater management within the City of East Point set forth in section 8-2410 of this article. Such utility shall be under the direction of the public works department. 
(b)  The city manager and finance director shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the city council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater management utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated, and allocated and expended as provided in subsection 8-2450(c). No other funds of the city shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including, but not limited to, grants, transfers of city funds, loans, and bond proceeds may be combined with and applied to stormwater management capital projects as deemed appropriate by the city council, upon recommendation of the city manager. 
(c)  Forty (40) percent of the revenues and receipts of the stormwater management utility enterprise fund shall be used for bond debt service, to the extent the city has outstanding debt associated with stormwater infrastructure or other stormwater management programs. The remaining sixty (60) percent of the enterprise fund shall be used to fund stormwater management programs as specified in Division 4 of this article and cost associated with administration of the stormwater utility itself. 
(d)  The city council hereby transfers to the public works department operational control over the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which stormwater management system components are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment. 
(e)  The city council hereby authorizes the establishment of a citizen stormwater utility advisory group. Each council member and the mayor shall select one member of the advisory group. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2451. - Funding policy. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater management utility is equitably derived through methods that have demonstrable relationships to the varied demands and costs imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater services and facilities by the city. 
(b)  Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. The cost of stormwater management services and facilities may include, without limitation, administrative, operating, capital investment, debt service, engineering and planning, and reserve expenses, and may also include related regulatory expenses associated with stormwater-related watershed management requirements. Properties shall be charged rentals, rates, charges, fees, or licenses in proportion to their related cost of service impact. 
(c)  Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater management utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2452. - Effective date of stormwater charges. 
Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning at such time deemed appropriate by the city council and mayor, and shall be billed periodically thereafter to customers. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2453. - Stormwater management utility service charges. 
(a)  There are hereby established stormwater management utility service charges that shall be billed to all developed properties in the East Point service area, except as specific exemptions or credits may allow for in this article or shall allow in future ordinances or amendments to this article. The stormwater management utility service charges may, but are not required to, include a service rate charge applied to each such property. 
(b)  The service rate charge, if applied, shall reflect the cost of providing services and facilities to properly control stormwater runoff quantity and quality. The most important factor in the city's present cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities to individual properties is the amount of impervious area on each property. 
(c)  Special service charges, if applied, shall be structured to recover the cost of providing to certain persons, entities, and properties types or levels of stormwater management services that are not commonly provided to all stormwater service charge ratepayers. Such services may include, but are not limited to, private development plan review and inspection, site inspections to verify the operational condition of on-site stormwater management systems, such as private detention/retention and conveyance facilities, monitoring and mitigate activities related to conditions on individual properties that impact water quality, and actions to abate conditions on private properties that do not comply with adopted city standards and/or that interfere with proper stormwater management and have been determined to constitute a public nuisance. 
(d)  The professional engineering and management analysis conducted for the city determined that properties within the city service area, regardless of classification, could be equitably and fairly charged a service fee based on a single family unit (SFU). An SFU is three thousand two hundred (3,200) square feet, which is the mean amount of impervious surface area for a typical detached residential dwelling unit in the City of East Point. 
(e)  The following service fees are hereby established and imposed for developed parcels of real property within the city service area: 
(1)  Single-family residential properties. The service fee for each parcel having one detached residential dwelling unit shall be based on a SFU rate of nine dollars and fifteen cents ($9.15) per month. Depending on the relative size of the dwelling unit's impervious surface area, adjustment factors shall be as follows: 
(i)  A small single family detached residence shall have an adjustment factor of 0.55. Statistical sampling shows that the impervious area of a small single family detached residence in the City of East Point is less than one thousand seven hundred sixty-nine (1,769) sq. ft. 
(ii)  The typical single-family detached residence shall not have an adjustment factor (the typical single-family detached residence is treated as 1.0 SFU). Statistical sampling shows that the impervious area of a typical single family detached residence in the City of East Point ranges from one thousand seven hundred sixty-nine (1,769) sq. ft. to four thousand seven hundred thirty-five (4,735) sq. ft. 
(iii)  A large single-family residence shall have an adjustment factor of 1.48. Statistical sampling shows that the impervious area of a large single-family detached residence is greater than four thousand seven hundred thirty-five (4,735) sq. ft. 
(2)  Other residential properties. The monthly service fee for other residential properties including apartments, condominiums, duplexes, triplexes, multifamily housing, mobile homes, and townhomes, shall be the SFU rate multiplied by an adjustment factor which adjusts the SFU to equal the mean impervious surface area of a statistical sampling typical of these residential dwelling units in the city. That adjustment factor has been determined to be as follows: 
(i)  Triplexes, condominiums and town houses shall have an adjustment factor of 0.39. 
(ii)  Condominium lofts and residential multifamily units shall have an adjustment factor of 0.33. 
(iii)  Duplexes shall have an adjustment factor of 0.51. 
(iv)  Residences located in mobile home parks shall have an adjustment factor of 0.46. 
The method for calculating the service fee for residential properties identified in subsections (1) and (2) above is as follows. 
Service Fee = SFU rate ($9.15/month) × Adjustment Factor 
Where, 
SFU rate is the Single-Family Residential Unit Rate that is applicable to one SFU. The SFU rate shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. 
Adjustment factor is a numerical value that adjusts the SFU to equal the mean impervious surface area of a statistical sampling typical of other residential properties in the City of East Point. The adjustment factor shall be established by the city council. 
(3)  Nonresidential properties. Nonresidential properties shall mean, but shall not be limited to, commercial and office buildings, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, churches and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces. The monthly service fee for nonresidential properties, including, but not limited to, government properties, commercial and office properties, industrial and manufacturing properties, institutional and non-profit properties, and parking lots shall be based upon the amount of square feet of impervious surface on each parcel, as determined by the public works department and approved by the city council through aerial photography, surface feature evaluation, or other processes, expressed in SFUs by rounding to the nearest tenth SFU. The service fee for nonresidential properties shall be the SFU rate multiplied by the number of SFUs calculated for a given parcel. The number of SFUs for a given parcel shall be determined by dividing the parcel's impervious surface by three thousand two hundred (3,200) sq. ft. 
_____ 
The method for calculating the service fee for each parcel of nonresidential property is as follows: 
Service Fee = Measured Impervious Surface (sq.ft.) × SFU rate ($9.15/month) 
SFU (3,200 sq.ft.)     
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12; Ord. No. 027-13, 11-26-13 )  
Sec. 8-2454. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater management utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or any other condition unrelated to the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Undeveloped lands and public right-of-ways shall be exempt. 
(a)  Developed land, including but not limited to multiple dwelling unit residential properties, individual detached dwelling units, groups of detached dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, public streets, roads, alleys, and by-ways, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants, may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the stormwater management utility service charge credit policy to be established by the public works department and approved by city council. 
(b)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the stormwater management utility service charge credit policy and/or upon continuing the provision of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2455. - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies, collections. 
(a)  Stormwater management utility service charges shall be billed and collected in the manner and at the interval deemed most efficient by the city, and shall be payable in accordance with the rules and regulations of the city finance department as applied generally to all bills. A stormwater service charge bill may be sent through the United States mail or by an alternate means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the past due date. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent, the city may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A one and one-half (1.5) percent per month late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater management utility service charge that becomes delinquent. 
(b)  The stormwater service charge shall be billed on a property tax bill. 
(c)  Any stormwater management utility service charge or portion of a service charge not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law or equity by the city. 
(d)  In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other ordinance of the city, failure to pay any utility service charge may result in a discontinuance of any or all other utility services provided by the city or by others with whom contractual agreements provide for discontinuance of service for nonpayment. The owner of each property, building, premises, lot, or house shall be obligated to pay such fee, which shall be enforceable by the city by action at law or equity. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12)  
Sec. 8-2456. - Appeals.

Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partners in a partnership holding a license from withdrawing from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of such license. Such a withdrawal shall not, however, serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership.

In such a transfer, it will be required that a new investigation fee be paid for the investigation for the new agent, but no new fees for the issuance of the license will be collected until the normal expiration date of the existing license. In those instances in which only the name of the establishment holding a license is to change, with no change in the ownership or agent holding the license, the partners, owners or stockholders shall notify the police department of the change of name, which notation shall be made on the records of the police department and forwarded to those city offices as required by the police chief. No charge will be made for this name change. 
(f)  Licenses hereunder shall be transferable from licensee to licensee at the same location. Transfers are granted only if there is no lapse in time from the transfer from one licensee to another licensee, except when there is a death of a licensee, then this period may be extended to six (6) months. It is a requirement that a death certificate be presented to the police department, and the new applicant must meet the requirements to become a licensee. 
A new applicant for a license at an existing licensed location is exempt from the distance requirements as long as a lapse in license does not exceed six (6) months at that location. All prospective licensees must meet the requirements of a new applicant as set forth in this chapter.

Sec. 11-2008. - Distribution of handbills; purpose. 
Inasmuch as handbills and flyers are constantly being left on private premises and in public places, there is a problem with litter resulting from handbills that are oftentimes blown into the streets and onto lawns and not retrieved. The resulting litter is detrimental to the quality of life for city residents and interferes with the quiet enjoyment of their property. In addition to the litter problem created by handbill distribution, an accumulation of handbills on private property can be a signal to burglars or vandals that the residence is unoccupied. In order to address these threats to the public health, safety and welfare, sections 11-2008 through 11-2011 of this chapter govern the distribution of handbills and impose penalties for violations thereof. 
(Code 1959, § 3-8; Ord. No. 009-02, § 1, 6-3-02; Ord. No. 020-09, 11-16-09; Ord. No. 001-11, 2-21-11; Ord. No. 004-12, 2-6-12)

(1)  Basic distance rate means the charge for distance for all intervals except the initial interval. 
(2)  Basic time rate means the charge for the time for all intervals except the initial interval. 
(3)  Cleared means a taximeter is inoperative with respect to all fare when no indication of fare or extras is shown and when all parts are in those positions in which they are designed to be when the vehicle on which the taximeter is installed is not engaged by a passenger. 
(4)  Cold tire pressure means the pressure in a tire when the tire is at ambient temperature. 
(5)  Face means a taximeter upon which passenger charges are indicated. 
(6)  Fare means that portion of the charge for the hire of a vehicle that is automatically calculated by a taximeter through the operation of the distance or time mechanism. 
(7)  Fifth wheel test means a distance test similar to a road test except that the distance traveled by the vehicle under test is determined by a mechanism known as a "fifth wheel" that is attached to the vehicle and that independently measures and indicates the distance. 
(8)  Flag means a plate at the end of the lever arm or similar part by which the operating condition of the taximeter is controlled. 
(9)  Hired means a taximeter that is operative with respect to all applicable indications of fares or extras. The indications of fare include time and distance where applicable unless by another indication of the term "time not recording" or an equivalent expression. 
(10)  Initial distance of time interva l means the interval corresponding to the initial money drop. 
(11)  Money drop means an increment of fare indication. The initial money drop is the first increment of fare indication following activation of the taximeter. 
(12)  Multiple-tariff taximeter means one that may be set to calculate fares at any one of two (2) or more rates. 
(13)  Operating tire pressure means the pressure in a tire when the vehicle has been driven for at least five (5) miles or eight (8) kilometers.

(f)  When a taximeter designed to calculate fares upon the basis of a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed is operative with respect to fare indication, the fare-indicting mechanism shall be actuated by the distance mechanism whenever the vehicle is in motion at such a speed that the rate of distance revenue equals or exceeds the time rate and may be actuated by the time mechanism whenever the vehicle speed is less than this and when the vehicle is not in motion. Means shall be provided for the vehicle operator to render the time mechanism either operative or inoperative with respect to the fare-indicating mechanism. 
(g)  Whenever the indicating elements of a taximeter are set to indicate a charge for the hire of the vehicle, the character of the fare indication shall be clearly shown on the taximeter face. When a taximeter is cleared, the indication "not registering," "vacant" or an equivalent expression shall be shown. 
(h)  Whenever a single-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the indication "registering," "hired" or an equivalent expression shall be shown. 
(i)  Whenever a multi-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the basis for the particular tariff for which it is set shall be shown. 
(j)  Indications of fare shall be displayed through and entirely protected by glass or other suitable transparent material securely attached to the housing of the taximeter.

(n)  Adequate provisions shall be made for affixing lead-and wire seals to a taximeter and to other parts required for service operation of a complete installation on a vehicle so that no adjustments, alterations or replacements affecting in any way the accuracy or indications of the device or the assembly can be made without mutilating the seals. The sealing means shall be such that it is not necessary to disassemble or remove any part of the device or of the vehicle to apply or inspect the seals. 
(o)  To determine compliance with distance tolerances, a distance test of a taximeter shall be conducted utilizing one or more of the following test methods: 
(1)  Road test. A road test consists of driving the vehicle over a precisely measured road course. 
(2)  Fifth wheel test. A fifth wheel test consists of driving the vehicle in a simulated road test; one hundred fifty (150) pounds or seventy (70) kilograms of test weights may be substituted in lieu of the second person.

PREFACE 
    This Zoning Code and Development Regulations constitute a complete republication of Part 10 of the East Point Code of Ordinances as a separate volume. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of these regulations were Exhibit "A" of Ord. No. 003-09, adopted March 2, 2009, which repealed in its entirety former Part 10, Planning and Development, of the East Point Code of Ordinances and enacted new provisions as set out in this volume. Provisions enacted or amended after March 2, 2009 include a history note appearing in parentheses at the end of the affected sections. 
Article and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter, article and section numbering system used in this volume reproduces the numbering system used by the city's publication. The "10" before the dash in the section number refers to Part 10 of the East Point Code of Ordinances. The sections of chapters generally start in increments of a thousand-The first section of Chapter 1 is 10-1001; the sixth section of Chapter 4 is 10-4006; the nineteenth section of Chapter 14 is 10-14019. Articles within chapters are numbered alphabetically, and divisions in articles are numbered sequentially with Roman numerals. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in the the Zoning Code and Development Regulations is a prefix system. The number to the right of the hyphen represents the number of the page in that portion. The following are examples of this system and their corresponding prefixes: 
Chapter 1, page 5 1-5 Zoning Code and Development Ordinances Comparative Table, page 1 CCT-1 Index, page 23 I-23  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

(b)  When a use cannot be readily classified into a use category/subcategory or appears to fit into multiple categories/subcategories, the Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to determine the most similar, and thus most appropriate, use category/subcategory based on the actual or projected characteristics of the principal use or activity in relationship to the use category and subcategory descriptions provided in this section. Any decision made by the Planning and Community Development Director to authorize a use in a zoning district where it is not specifically authorized shall be published, and notice sent to adjacent property owners. In making such determinations, the Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to consider all of the following: 
(1)  The types of activities that will occur in conjunction with the use; 
(2)  The types of equipment and processes to be used; 
(3)  The existence, number and frequency of residents, customers or employees; 
(4)  Parking demands associated with the use; and 
(5)  Other factors deemed relevant to a use determination. 
(c)  If a use can reasonably be classified in multiple categories, subcategories or specific use types, the Planning and Community Development Director must categorize the use in the category, subcategory or specific use type that provides the most exact, narrowest and appropriate match. 
(d)  If the Planning and Community Development Director is unable to determine the appropriate use category for a proposed use, the Planning and Community Development Director is authorized to deny the permit request.

(Ord. of 11-21-2016, § II) 
Sec. 10-2015. - Nonconforming lots, uses and structures. 
    Within the zoning districts established by this Ordinance there may exist lots, structures, and uses of both land and structures which were lawful before this Ordinance was adopted or subsequently amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance as adopted or subsequently amended. Nonconforming lots, uses and structures may continue in their nonconforming status with the following limitations and/or requirements. 
(a)  Nonconforming lot. A single, lawful lot-of-record which does not meet the requirements of this Ordinance for area or dimensions, or both, may be used for the buildings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out permitted uses subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Parking space requirements as provided for in Article E are met; and 
(2)  Such lot does not adjoin another vacant lot(s) or portion of a lot in the same ownership. 
(3)  If two (2) or more adjoining undeveloped lots in single ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width, frontage or area, the property involved shall be treated as one lot, and no portion of said lot shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with this Ordinance. This paragraph shall not apply to non-conforming lots when 50 percent or more of adjoining lots on the same street are the same size or smaller. 
(b)  Nonconforming uses of land. When a use of land is nonconforming pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance, such use may continue as long as it remains otherwise lawful and complies with the following provisions: 
(1)  No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than that which was occupied at the time use became nonconforming; 
(2)  No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot not occupied by such use at the time the use became nonconforming; and 
(3)  If any nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of more than one year, regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon by the property owner, any subsequent use of such land shall comply with this Ordinance. 
(c)  Nonconforming use of structures. If a lawful use of structure, or of a structure and lot in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption of this ordinance or its subsequent amendment that would not be allowed under provisions of this Ordinance as adopted or amended, the use may be continued so long as it complies with other regulations, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  To avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use of any structure or land at the time of the enactment of this Ordinance or any subsequent amendment may be continued even though the use does not conform to the provisions of this Ordinance, except that the nonconforming use: 
a.  Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
b.  Shall not be reestablished after its removal from the property or its discontinuance for one year or more, or unless the premises are under a continuing lease but are unoccupied by the nonconforming use, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier to resume the nonconforming use. 
c.  Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of land. 
d.  Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of a building or structure unless such additional area of the building or structure existed at the time of the passage or amendment of this Ordinance and was clearly designed to house the same use as the nonconforming use occupying the other portion of the building or structure. 
(2)  If an existing use was lawfully established in a zoning district that is subsequently amended to require Special Use approval for such use, the existing use shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
(3)  Any intended but not yet existing nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the adoption of this Ordinance or the adoption of an amendment to it shall be prohibited unless such intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired is actually commenced within one year of the adoption of this Ordinance or the adoption of an amendment to it regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use. 
(d)  Nonconforming Structures. When a structure exists on the effective date of adoption of this Ordinance or its amendments that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance because of restrictions on building area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may remain as long as it complies with all other zoning regulations, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  No structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
(2)  Any structure which is moved, for any reason and for any distance whatever, shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located. 
(3)  Destruction by any means of more than sixty percent of the gross square footage of a structure shall require that the structure be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
(4)  Telecommunications facilities. 
a.  All telecommunication facilities existing on the effective date of this Ordinance shall be allowed to continue to be used as they presently exist. 
b.  Routine maintenance (including modifications to accommodate the co-location of an additional user or users) shall be permitted on existing telecommunication facilities. 
c.  Replacement of antennas on a structure with different antennas shall be considered routine maintenance so long as the replacement antenna(s) does not increase the height of any existing structure. 
(e)  Rezoning which results in nonconforming structures. When a property containing lawful structures is rezoned, the following shall apply: 
(1)  The approval of the rezoning by the City Council shall automatically adjust minimum/maximum yards to the extent necessary for existing structures to comply. 
(2)  All new construction, expansions or additions shall comply with the minimum yard requirements of the new district. 
(3)  Buffers and landscape areas shall be established by conditions of zoning which shall have precedence over the district standards contained in Chapter 6. 
(4)  Destruction or removal of buildings which preexisted rezoning shall reinstate the development standards of the then applicable district provisions of this zoning ordinance. 
(f)  Exemptions due to State or City action. Whenever a lot becomes nonconforming as a result of land acquisition by the city or state, building permits shall be granted for new construction provided the proposed structure complies with all but lot area requirements, and setback requirements shall be reduced without requirement for a variance to the extent of the width of the acquired property. 
Whenever a structure becomes nonconforming as a result of city or state action other than an amendment to this ordinance, the use of the structure may continue and the structure may be replaced as though no nonconformity exists if, subsequent to such action, the structure is destroyed.

Sec. 10-2020. - Large scale retail/service commercial structures and developments 75,000 square feet or greater {10-2020.1 through 10-2020.3} 
Sec. 10-2020.1 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of establishing requirements for large-scale retail establishments is to apply design standards and additional conditions to large developments proposed in East Point in order to ensure the development of appropriate, functional, well-planned, aesthetically pleasing retail/service commercial developments that stimulate economic and social growth, are integrated with surrounding areas, positively contribute to the changing community character, with facilities that have functional reuse potential in the future. 
    As such, these regulations intend to promote high quality materials and design, promote pedestrian-friendly environments, encourage infrastructure concurrency, encourage responsible storm-water management practices, and promote environmental planning policies. 
    The regulations are to be used in conjunction with the development criteria of the East Point Zoning Ordinance and all other adopted development standards and criteria, including overlay district standards. 
( Ord. No. 061-016, § 2(Exh. B), 9-19-16 ) 
Sec. 10-2020.2. - Number, size and location criteria. 
    Large scale retail establishments or developments cannot be accessed solely via collector or local roads, as defined by East Point guidelines and depicted on the Georgia Department of Transportation Road Functional Classification maps. They are solely permitted on sites with at least one frontage on an arterial road. However, the Director may waive the road classification criteria if the developer can demonstrate that the proposed road improvements, with identified funding sources, will accommodate projected traffic volume to be generated by the proposed development to the degree that the current level of service (LOS) or better is maintained for the affected road segment. 
    No more than four large scale retail establishments, as defined in this Ordinance, are allowed in a single development. Developments may include additional smaller retail structures as part of the overall development; however, the number of retail establishments that are 75,000 square feet or larger is limited to four, and such developments are subject to the regulations outlined in this Ordinance. 
    Developments are encouraged to create a cluster effect in order to achieve a village and/or town center effect. This Ordinance promotes an appropriate mix of large and small scale retail with smaller retail buildings located closer to streets in order to reduce the visual scale of the development, encourage pedestrian traffic, and promote the use of architectural details. 
    This Ordinance also recognizes the varied types of developments in East Point and promotes the use of screening and buffers.

Sec. 10-2116. - Adult book store. 
    Intent and findings. It is the intent of this article to regulate the place of operation of adult book stores as defined in this Ordinance. The City Council finds, based upon an October, 1980, study by the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, entitled An Analysis of the Relationship Between Adult Entertainment Establishments, Crime, and Housing Values, that adult book stores are significantly related to diminishing market values of neighboring residential uses, that adult book stores should not be located in residential areas, and that adult book stores should be permitted only in locations that are at least 1/10 mile, or approximately 500 feet, from residential areas. 
    The Council further finds, based upon a June, 1978, study by the Division of Planning of the St. Paul, Minnesota, Department of Planning and Economic Development and the Community Crime Prevention Project of the Minnesota Crime Control Planning Board entitled Effects on Surrounding Area of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Saint Paul, that the presence of adult book stores correlates with a decreasing market value of neighboring residential areas, that adult book stores tend to locate in areas of poorer residential condition, tend to be followed by a relative worsening of the residential condition, and that more than two adult entertainment businesses in an immediate area is associated with a statistically significant decrease in residential property market value, and that such a concentration of adult entertainment businesses in a given area should be discouraged. The Council also finds that such worsening of residential conditions will adversely affect uses found in residential areas or in the proximity of residential areas, such as public recreational facilities, public or private institutional uses, churches, schools, universities, colleges, trade-schools, libraries, and day care centers. 
    The Council further finds, based upon a May 19, 1986, land use study conducted in Austin, Texas, that an adult book store within one block of a residential area decreases the market value of homes, that adult book stores are considered a sign of decline by lenders, making underwriters hesitant to approve the 90-95 percent financing many home buyers require, and that patrons of adult book stores tend to be from outside the immediate neighborhood in which the adult book store is located. 
    The Council further finds, based upon a March 3, 1986, study conducted by the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Community Development Department entitled Adult Entertainment Businesses in Oklahoma City - A Survey of Real Estate Appraisers, that an adult bookstore will have a negative effect on residential property market values if it is located closer than one block to residential uses. 
    This section is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult bookstores, and the City Council finds that restricting adult book stores to industrially zoned areas and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate adult book stores by establishing zones where adult book stores are most compatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood, and by requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult bookstore uses and other uses so as to afford the most protection to residential uses. 
    It is not the intent of the City Council, in enacting this amendment to the zoning ordinance, to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor is it the intent to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books, or other materials; further, in the adoption of this amendment to the zoning ordinance, the City Council does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute, or exhibit such constitutionally protected materials; finally, in the enactment of this ordinance, the City Council intends to adopt a content neutral measure to address the secondary effects of adult bookstores.

The Department of Planning and Community Development and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make recommendations to the City Council regarding the approval or denial of the use permit and the Council shall make the final decision after a public hearing regarding the same. In the event the City Council has not granted or denied the application within 120 days (unless the application is suspended by failure of the applicant to provide data, information or records as reasonably requested by the City to complete the investigation), the use permit shall automatically issue. 
(e)  Denial of use permit: In the event an application for a use permit is denied by the City Council, the applicant shall be notified in writing of such denial within ten business days by U.S. Mail. A decision by the City Council regarding the denial of said permit is a final action; therefore, any appeal of such decision shall be pursued by application for writ of certiorari filed with the Superior Court of Fulton County within 30 days of the decision. This appeal shall in no way preclude an applicant from seeking any other remedies available at law or equity. 
(f)  Permit application: Nothing in this section shall allow for the conducting or zoning of any business or entity which would otherwise be illegal.

Sec. 10-2155. - Shared parking. 
    The standards for shared parking may be utilized for any of the combinations of uses shown below on any number of properties when approval is reflected in the conditions of zoning for each such property. Similar provisions are provided under OFF-SITE AND SHARED PARKING REQUIREMENTS in the Use Permits article for those uses which were not zoned concurrently or as part of a multiple use project. The conditions of zoning or Use Permit, as applicable, establish the limits of parking requirements among uses and properties, and East Point shall not require any contractual relationship among property owners. 
    The standards for determining parking requirements in a multiple use development are: 
(a)  Determine the minimum amount of parking required for each separate use. 
(b)  Multiply each parking requirement by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods given below. 
(c)  Calculate the column total parking requirement for each time period. 
(d)  The largest column total is the shared parking requirement.

Frontage roads provide public access to the adjacent parcels, help control access to the major facility, and/or maintain circulation of traffic on each side of the major facility. 
Street, residential: The following definitions are intended to distinguish between different categories of streets internal to residential developments: 
Major development street: A local road internal to a development which serves 50 or more housing units. These units do not have to be directly served by the major development street. Major development streets are roads that serve as collectors for the development traffic. Any residential street which accesses a collector or arterial road as set forth in 3.2.30 shall be considered a major development street for the first 300 feet regardless of housing unit service. 
Minor development street: A local road internal to a development which serves fewer than 50 housing units and does not access a collector or arterial road as set forth in 3.2.30. 
Housing unit service: The number of housing units served by a street or collection of streets shall be the aggregate number of housing units provided, or potentially to be provided, with driveway access directly from the street(s) plus the number of units utilizing or potentially utilizing the street(s) for through traffic movements. Such calculations shall be made beginning and ending at the same street intersection. 
Stub-out street: A street having one end open to traffic and being temporarily terminated at the other. Stub-outs generally do not have a temporary vehicular turn-around. This temporary termination is to provide connectivity to future developments and may be constructed without curb and gutter provided such stub-out street meets the standards of the East Point Fire Department. 
    Subdivider: Any development owner, person, individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, estate, trust, agent of development owner, or any other group or combination acting as a unit dividing or proposing to divide land so as to constitute a development as herein defined. 
    Development, residential and non-residential: Any division of a lot, tract or parcel, regardless of its existing or future use, into two or more lots, tracts or parcels. The term "development" may mean the act or process of dividing development, except that, where appropriate to the context, the term "development" may be used in reference to the aggregate of all lots held in common ownership at the time of development. 
    Traffic mitigation action plan: A plan that studies and addresses the number of trips a development will produce when such development results in the reduction of the level of service on any roadway currently functioning at "D" or worse in accordance with the City Transportation Standards. This plan shall include, but is not limited to, roadway improvements and other proposals such as providing transit access, transit use incentives, car/van pooling, bicycle path construction, off-site and internal sidewalk construction, and lunch trip reduction. Such plan shall mitigate the traffic impact in a manner that will show no negative impact on roads with level of service of "D" or worse. 
    Trails, pedestrian or others: Extended and usually continuous strips of land established independently of other routes of travel and dedicated, through ownership or easement, to recreational travel including hiking, horseback riding, etc. 
    Utility accommodations - Guidelines and Procedures: A City program maintained by the Department of Public Works which includes installing, maintaining, repairing, operating, or using a pole line, buried cable, pipeline, or miscellaneous utility facility, and performing miscellaneous operations authorized by a utility permit. 
    Utility permit: An official authorization issued by the Department of Public Works, allowing alteration of land within the right-of-way for the commencement of any construction activities pertaining to utility installation or relocation. 
    Zoning ordinance: The Zoning Ordinance of East Point, Georgia. 
( Ord. No. 024-015, § 2, 1-20-2015 ) 
Sec. 10-4005. - Requirements.

    Proposals for the development, combination or recombination of lawful previously platted lots or parcels, or portions thereof, shall be in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance, as amended. 
    If construction activity contemplated results in the disturbance of an area of 5,000 square feet or more, a land disturbance permit must be approved along with any building permit prior to construction. 
    Where a proposed lot fronts an existing public street, the subdivider shall improve the street along the lot's frontage to the applicable standards of these regulations and any Standard Details as determined by the Director of Public Works. 
    All slope, drainage and utility easements, as well as necessary right-of-way widths (as determined by the Director of Public Works) on an existing public street, paved or unpaved, shall be provided by the subdivider at no cost to East Point. 
    Each proposed lot shall comply with the requirements of the Fulton County Department of Health, whose certification of approval shall accompany the submission of the final plat to the Director of Planning and Zoning. 
    Each lot created under the provisions of a minor plat shall not subsequently be re-subdivided pursuant to the provisions of a minor plat. 
    For the division of land in O-I-T, C-1, C-2, MIX, and I-1 and I-2 Zoning Districts, after initial development of the development, the following standards shall also apply: 
(a)  A proposed lot fronting an existing public street shall contain the necessary frontage required by the East Point Zoning Ordinance. 
(b)  The subdivider shall submit documentation of the necessary easements providing for access to a public street for proposed lots that front only on an existing, documented, paved private street or driveway.

Sec. 10-4032. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  Introduction. 
(1)  Purpose: The objective of this subsection is to provide facilities that ensure safe pedestrian movement in the City of East Point. 
(2)  Intent: Sidewalks are intended to provide a safe pedestrian connection between the subdivision/development and nearby destinations. Pedestrians consist of children walking to and from school and neighborhood activities, as well as adults walking to and from neighborhood shopping and transit stops. In addition to the need for sidewalks for circulation and safety, sidewalks can be important elements in the recreational system of this community. They can also serve as walking and hiking trails. 
(b)  Performance approach. 
(1)  Performance factors: The performance approach shall be applied in determining the need for sidewalks. In this case, the decision to require a development to provide sidewalks shall be made on a case-by-case basis. 
(2)  Several basic factors shall be used in applying the performance approach: These are street classification and current/potential future volume of pedestrian traffic; residential land use/development density; relation to residential areas; proximity of schools, school bus stops, shopping areas; and proximity of parks, libraries, bike paths/pedestrian trails, greenspace corridors, and other land uses. 
a.  Street classification and volume of pedestrian traffic: As traffic volume and road speeds increase, there is more need for separate pedestrian ways to ascertain safety. Sidewalks shall be provided along local streets, collectors, arterials, and private roads. 
b.  Residential land use and development density: 
(i)  Sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all local streets and street frontages where the residential land use designation in the comprehensive plan is eight units/acre or higher density. 
(ii)  Sidewalks shall be provided along at least one side of all local streets when the residential land use designation in the comprehensive plan is less than eight units/acre. 
c.  Relation to residential areas: In general, sidewalks are intended to be within the street right-of-way. This traditional location of sidewalks may be replaced in mixed-use developments by a flexible pedestrian circulation system. Such a system would connect individual dwelling units with other units, off-street parking, open space system, and recreational facilities. Also, this system may be permitted to meander through the development within prescribed sidewalk easements. If the sidewalk leaves the right-of-way, an easement and indemnification agreement must be provided for public access and maintenance. 
d.  Proximity of schools and shopping areas: 
(i)  Sidewalks shall be required in subdivisions located within one mile from an existing or proposed school on both sides of any street that provides access to such school. Subdivisions at each side of the street shall provide sidewalks at the corresponding frontage. 
(ii)  Sidewalks shall be provided within a distance of up to one mile along both sides of streets leading to or going through shopping areas. 
e.  Proximity of parks, libraries, bike paths/pedestrian trails, greenspace corridors, and other land uses: Sidewalks are needed in areas where the following nonresidential land use designations exist: 
(i)  Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets and street frontages in commercial, living-working, and business park land use designation areas. 
(ii)  Sidewalks may be required in industrial subdivisions. 
(iii)  Sidewalks may be required within a distance of up to one mile along both sides of streets leading to or going through places of public assembly/transit facilities/other congested areas and other similar places deemed proper by the Director of Public Works for public necessity and safety. 
f.  Relation to established pattern of sidewalks: Future location of sidewalks should follow the already established pattern of existing sidewalks (on one side of the street, on both sides, width, etc.). 
(c)  General specifications. 
(1)  Sidewalks shall be provided by the subdivider at no cost to the city. 
(2)  Sidewalks shall have a minimum width of five feet indicated by a note on the conceptual plan. 
(3)  For non-residential developments, sidewalks shall be a minimum of six feet wide. 
(4)  Sidewalks must be provided on or adjacent to an individual lot prior to the issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
(5)  Prior to the recording of the final plat, 125 percent of the cost of the internal sidewalks for any residential subdivision must be performance bonded. This bond will be released when all sidewalks internal to the development have been constructed and approved. All required sidewalks must be provided internal to any residential subdivision within two years of the recording of the final plat, otherwise, the bond is forfeited and the city will use the funds to complete the sidewalk construction. 
(d)  Review guidelines. The Director of Public Works may issue guidelines to facilitate the application of the performance-based approach including, but is not limited to, a point system. The intent is to ascertain fairness and consistency in the application of this section. 
(e)  Exception. When the developer requests to install (within a development) sidewalks that are not required by the subdivision regulations and at no cost to the city, the Director of Public Works may approve a reduction in width to a minimum width of four feet. 
(f)  Sidewalk Bank. 
(1)  There is hereby established an East Point Sidewalk Bank for the maintenance and disbursement of funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. 
(2)  Where it is determined by the Director of Public Works that construction of sidewalks adjacent to the applicant's property is implausible contribution in lieu of sidewalk construction shall be made to the East Point Sidewalk Bank. The fee shall be set annually by the Director of Public Works and shall be assessed per linear foot of sidewalk constructed. 
(3)  Funds maintained in the East Point Sidewalk Bank shall be administered by the Finance Department pursuant to rules and regulations regarding said funds. 
Sec. 10-4033. - Street trees. 
(a)  Street trees and other shrubbery that may be retained or planted shall not obstruct sight distances and shall be subject to the approval of the Director. 
(b)  Street trees that may be required by the Director along the street(s) shall be of species approved as street trees in the Tree Protection and Landscaping Ordinance. 
ARTICLE D. - WATER, WASTEWATER AND STORMWATER 

Sec. 10-4034. - Water supply. 
    Where a public water supply is within 300 feet, the subdivider shall install or have installed a system of water mains and connect to such supply. The installation of mains and connections to each lot shall be installed prior to the paving of the street, if possible. The installation shall include services and meter boxes if it is connected to the City of East Point Water System. 
    Where a public water supply is not available, each lot in a development shall be furnished with a water supply system approved by the Fulton County Health Department. 
    A separate water service connection shall be provided for each residential unit. Meters shall be located as specified by the utility company. 
    Fire hydrants shall be located and set in accordance with City of East Point Public Utilities Specifications and the East Point Standard Plans where applicable. In addition, the fire hydrant shall be serviced by the following: 
(a)  Not less than a eight-inch diameter main if the system is looped. 
(b)  Not less than an eight-inch diameter main if the system is not looped or the fire hydrant is installed on a dead end main exceeding 300 feet in length. 
(c)  In no case shall dead end main(s) exceed 600 feet in length for main sizes less than ten inch. 
    When required by the Public Works Department, a reuse water irrigation distribution system to each lot shall be installed. This system shall consist of an eight-inch diameter ductile iron pipe identified an "non-potable water," painted purple in accordance with standard pipe identification schedules, and installed on the south or east shoulder of the right or way limit. All pipes and appurtenances must be in accordance with the East Point Water Reuse Standards. Each development owner requesting an irrigation meter shall connect to the reuse water main, if activated. 
    If a development is re-platted and the originally platted lots configuration is changed after the water service lines have been installed, the water system shall be modified to properly serve each lot in accordance with East Point water specifications. 
Sec. 10-4035. - Sanitary sewer management. 
    When public sanitary sewers are within 300 feet of the development, the subdivider shall provide sanitary sewer services to each lot within the bounds of the development. All street sewers serving lots in the development shall be installed by the subdivider. A formula may be developed by the Department of Public Works to provide for a sharing of the costs of sewer facilities needed to serve the development and other developments in the same drainage basin. 
    When the operation of a temporary sanitary sewer system requires land to be set aside for a disposal plant, the development owner shall give the City title to the development for as long as the plant is in operation. The title may carry a reversionary clause returning the development to the owner when the site is no longer necessary for the operation of the plant. 
    In a drainage basin, which at time of plat application is scheduled for a public sewerage system, all developments shall be provided with a temporary community sewerage disposal system as approved by the Department of Public Works. The system shall include permanent sewerage outfall lines plus a temporary treatment plant to be installed by the subdivider. 
    Whenever the installation of a sanitary sewer is required, as provided by these rules and regulations, no new street shall be paved without the sewer being first installed in accordance with the requirements of the sewer specifications of the Department of Public Works and the East Point Sewer Regulations. 
    If a development is re-platted and the originally platted lots configuration is changed after the sewer service lines have been installed, the sewer system shall be modified to properly serve each lot in accordance with East Point sewer specifications. 
Sec. 10-4036. - Storm water provisions. 
    See Chapter 11. Storm Water Management 
Sec. 10-4037. - Detention/retention design. 
(a)  General provisions:

If any control devices are damaged or destroyed during grading or construction, all processes shall cease until such devices are restored to their functioning capability. The owner, through application for grading or construction permits, accepts the responsibility of maintenance of the control devices. 
(2)  When serving more than three lots, detention ponds, retention ponds, and water quality features (including all required access easements, landscape strips, and fences) shall be located on a separate parcel where no home can be constructed. This parcel shall be owned and maintained by the homeowners' association or the owners of the lots being served by this pond. The parcel shall have a minimum of 20' wide continuous access to a public or private road in a manner that allows access and maintenance of this parcel. In addition, this parcel will not be required to meet the normal lot standard. 
(b)  Layout design standards: The ponds layout shall provide for the following minimums: 
(1)  Twenty-foot graded access easement; 
(2)  Twenty-foot landscape strip for screening purposes; 
(3)  Ten-foot access easement for maintenance; and 
(4)  Fences of decorative wrought iron, aluminum or green vinyl clad chain link with a planted landscape strip around the fencing. Fence height shall not exceed six feet in height. 
(c)  Alternative design standards: Applicants are encouraged to carry out innovative detention/retention layout that is intended to make such facilities an attractive amenity or focal point to the development. 
    To achieve that, the Director may approve the following alternative design standards in lieu of those in sections 10-4037(a) and 10-4037(b). 
(1)  Such alternative design should provide for attractive layout and means for detaining/ retaining/moving water. 
(2)  The design should follow the natural land forms around the perimeter of the basin. The basin should be shaped to emulate a naturally formed depression. 
(3)  Redistributing soils from basin construction to create natural landforms around the perimeter of the basin is encouraged. These forms should be located strategically to filter views or redirect and soften the views from residential areas. 
(4)  Side slopes of basins must not exceed one-foot vertical for every four-foot horizontal. Where possible, side slopes should be varied to imitate natural conditions. Associated natural landforms should have side slopes no greater than one-foot vertical for every three-foot horizontal to accommodate lawn maintenance equipment. Varied slopes will be encouraged. 
(5)  The applicant should consider the use of plant materials that naturally grow in the area. Trees and shrubs should be grouped in informal patterns to emulate the natural environment. The intent is to soften the views of these basins. 
(d)  Design guidelines: The Director may issue design guidelines illustrating details of the standards in Section 10.4009(c).

ARTICLE I. - DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS 

Sec. 10-4047. - Purpose. 
    This document is intended to clearly define the process of constructing a legal access point or any other work in the right of way of City Roads in East Point. To accomplish this we are modifying sections three through five of the Georgia Department of Transportation document "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control" and adopting this modified version. Any variance to the standards set forth in this manual must be in the form of a written appeal to the Director of Public Works, along with the appropriate studies to support the variance request. 
Sec. 10-4048. - Driveway spacing. 
    As drivers approach each intersection along a roadway, they are often presented with decisions and may be required to stop or make various maneuvers. When exiting the roadway, it is necessary to decelerate and in some cases, to change lanes. It may also be necessary to adjust speeds in reaction to other vehicles entering into the arterial traffic stream. Driveways should be spaced so that drivers can perceive and react to the conditions at each intersection in succession. 
    Spacing between driveways should be at least equal to the distance traveled, at the posted speed limit, during the normal perception and reaction time plus the distance traveled as the vehicle decelerates to a stop. Each intersection also requires a certain amount of storage space for vehicles waiting to enter. The distance between intersections should be great enough to provide this storage, allowing each intersection to have its functional boundary separated from those of the next intersection. Crash data also indicates that as the number of driveways along a roadway increases so do accident rates. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself an indication that driveways will be allowed. 
    Guidelines for driveway spacing, associated with the construction of new driveways, are provided in Table 3-1. Driveways should be separated from any other facility, which accesses a City roadway, whether it is another driveway or a public street. Minimum spacing requirements also apply to driveways on the opposite side of undivided roadways. 
    Requirements for the length of right and left turn lanes, as shown in Table 11 and Table 13, may increase the minimum allowable spacing shown in Table 1. 

POSTED SPEED, MPH DRIVEWAY SPACING MINIMUM FT 25 200 30 250 35 300 40 300 45 300 50 300 55 350  
Table 1: Driveway Spacing Criteria 
Sec. 10-4049. - Spacing of one-way driveways. 
    Figure 1 shows a typical layout of one-way driveways. The spacing criteria presented in Table 1 does not apply to the distance between the two one-way driveways (driveway pair). 
    A driveway pair must be separated from another driveway pair by the distance as shown in Table 
(1)  A driveway pair must also be separated from an adjacent two-way driveway in accordance with the spacing criteria in Table 1. 

Figure 1: Spacing Criteria for One-Way Driveways 
Sec. 10-4050. - Placement of driveways. 
    Not only must driveways be spaced from other driveways as provided above, they must also be located a minimum distance from the property line. The radius return must be a minimum of 5' from the property line. 
    When driveways are to be jointly used by two or more property owners, the property line separation requirements given in the above paragraph can be waived. However, a joint use agreement signed by the affected property owners must be provided to the Access Management Engineer. Either property owner may apply for the driveway permit. 
Sec. 10-4051. - Driveway spacing. 
    Driveways should align with other driveways located on the opposite side of the roadway. If offset driveways cannot be avoided, the same driveway spacing criteria as given in Table 1 should be provided, to provide space for left turns. Figure 2 shows how the spacing is measured for locating offset driveways on undivided roadways. Spacing is from Center to Center. 

Figure 2: Spacing of Offset Driveways 
    If the City roadway involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover, the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway located on the same side of the roadway as shown above in Figure 2. 
Sec. 10-4052. - Residential driveways. 
    Driveways serving single family residential homes or townhouses do not have to adhere to the standards set forth in the previous sections, as they have a less significant impact than a new street or commercial driveway. Not more than two private curb cuts may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling. When there are two curb cuts on any one street frontage, there shall be a safety zone between the cuts not less than ten feet, as measured along the curbline. In no case shall the curb cut be less than five feet from the side property line as measured along the right-of-way line. The curb cut shall not encroach upon the radius of the curb at a street corner. 
    Not more than one private curb cut may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling where the street is classified as a Collector or higher order street. If a lot has access to more than one frontage, it may not have any private curb cuts on a street that is classified as a Collector or higher order street. If both frontages are classified as Collector or higher order streets, then the curb cut may be on the frontage with the lowest classification, or as designated by the Public Works Department. 
Sec. 10-4053. - Spacing of median crossovers. 
    When the applicant is requesting a median crossover on a divided roadway, the spacing standards shown in Table 2 apply. 

CONDITION CROSSOVER SPACING IN FEET Desirable Minimum RURAL 2640 1320 URBAN 1320 660  
Table 2: Spacing of Median Crossovers 
    Other factors will also be considered, such as distance to other median openings, adjacent land use, expected traffic volumes, and the resulting volume of U-turns that are likely to occur without the median opening. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself, an indication that median openings will be allowed. 
Sec. 10-4054. - Spacing of signalized intersections. 
    This section is provided to assist the applicant's engineer in designing sites that may need signalized points of access to the City roadway. Table 3 contains guidelines for the spacing that should be provided between signalized intersections. 

CONDITION SIGNAL SPACING IN FEET Desirable Minimum RURAL 2640 1320 URBAN 1320 1,000  
Table 3: Spacing of Signalized Intersections 
    The spacing guidelines provided above are indicative of conditions that normally offer better signal progression for arterial traffic flow. It is recognized that under certain conditions, better operation may result from the introduction of signals with less spacing if the alternative forces high volumes of traffic to an adjacent intersection. 
    When the applicant can show, through an alternatives analysis, that better operations can be achieved with less spacing, the Department of Public Works will consider an exception to the provisions of Table 3. 
Sec. 10-4055. - Design criteria. 
    The design of driveways shall comply with the guidelines of AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Bridges, current edition. This manual provides a summary of the minimum design constraints that will be checked during the plan review process. 
    The geometric design of an intersection is a collection of various elements such as radius, width, grade, angle of intersection, etc. that, in combination, provide for satisfactory operation of the vehicles that will use the intersection. Since the operating characteristics vary dramatically for different types of vehicles, the designer must first establish the design vehicle on which to base the driveway design. The designer should also check the final design to ensure the design vehicles can operate satisfactorily. 
Sec. 10-4056. - Design for trucks. 
    The design criteria given in this chapter has more stringent requirements for trucks. Even though the general use of such guidance would result in more desirable operations for all vehicles, it is neither practical nor necessary to design all facilities to accommodate trucks. The designer must use judgment in selecting the proper design vehicle. 
    When semi trailer combination trucks are expected to use the intersection on a regular basis and in numbers more than just an occasional vehicle, then the intersection should be designed to accommodate the truck movements. This includes most driveways designed for industrial use and many commercial driveways. 
    For commercial uses such as shopping centers, the preliminary site plan should indicate where heavy duty pavement would be provided to accommodate truck access to loading docks. Any driveway associated with access/egress for the loading docks should use the truck radii. Minor movement driveways, particularly those that allow only right turns will generally only be used by passenger cars. 
Sec. 10-4057. - Driveway width. 
    When traffic impact studies are required, the driveway shall be designed to provide the number of lanes recommended in the study. The findings within the study supersede the standards set forth in Table 4. Standard lane widths are 12'. 
    When the need for multiple lanes is not established from a traffic impact study, the minimum and maximum driveway widths are as set forth in Table 4.

Table 4: Driveway Widths 
Sec. 10-4058. - Corner radii. 
    Corner radii are generally established by the minimum path of the inside wheels of the design vehicle when making a right turn. The minimum corner radii to be used for driveways are given in Table 5.

Table 5: Minimum Corner Radii 
Sec. 10-4059. - Left turning control radii. 
    The path of the inside wheels during left turns is also important for the design of median openings and intersections with dual left turn lanes. Table 6 contains guidelines for minimum left turning radii.

Table 6: Left Turning Control Radius 
Sec. 10-4060. - Median crossover design. 
    Driveways onto divided City roadways where full access is to be provided shall be designed in accordance with Georgia DOT Construction Details for Median Crossovers. The detail has two types of designs (See Figure 3) that are applicable in different situations in East Point. Type A median crossovers will not be permitted. 
Sec. 10-4061. - Type B median crossover. 
    Type B median crossovers are required when the projected volume of the left turn movement exceeds 50 vehicles per hour per direction and/or when the median width is sufficient to offset the left turn lane from the adjacent through lane. This design provides better sight distance for vehicles in the left turn lane. This is important for unsignalized intersections and when unprotected turns are allowed at signalized intersections. 
Sec. 10-4062. - Type C median crossover. 
    Type C median crossovers are typically used in urban areas where the median width is limited to approximately 24 feet or less. With this type of crossover, it may be necessary to add pavement to the opposite edge in order to accommodate U-turns. 
    Table 7 illustrates the minimum pavement width that is required for vehicles to make U-turns. The required width is given for passenger cars and for WB-50 trucks. However, provisions for U-turns at median openings are normally based on passenger cars.

Table 7: Minimum Road Width for U-Turns 
Sec. 10-4063. - Sight distance. 
    Driveways should be located to provide adequate sight distance. Minimum intersection sight distance criteria are provided in Table 8. The line of sight establishes the boundary of a sight triangle, within which there should be no sight obstruction. Any location where the sight line leaves the right-of-way, a permanent maintenance easement must be filed, and the area must be graded and landscaped such that sight distance is not compromised.

Table 8: Intersection Sight Distance Requirements 
    The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stop-controlled approach to the City roadway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed. 
    The sight distances given in Table 8 are for undivided roadways. If the roadway is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than three percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars. 
Sec. 10-4064. - Horizontal alignment. 
    In general, the horizontal alignment of driveways should be designed using a tangent section from the centerline of the City roadway and extending to the property line. Horizontal curves should be sufficient to provide safe operations at speeds that would normally occur in the areas where they are constructed. 
Sec. 10-4065. - Angle of intersection. 
    Intersecting driveways and roads should generally meet at or nearly at right angles. Driveways and roads intersecting at acute angles create sight limitations that should be avoided. 
    In some cases, a more suitable overall design can be achieved by allowing intersecting angles other than 90 degrees. Table 9 gives the minimum angle of intersection that will generally be allowed for driveways designed to accommodate two-way traffic flow.

in Degrees Residential 80 Commercial 85 When Designed for Trucks 88  
Table 9: Minimum Angle of Intersection for Two-Way Driveways 
Sec. 10-4066. - Alignment of approach and departure lanes. 
    Driveways should be designed and constructed so as to align with driveways or streets on the opposite side of the roadway. The alignment of through movements crossing the roadway should be such that abrupt shifts in the travel pattern are not required. 
Sec. 10-4067. - Auxiliary turn lanes. 
    When any auxiliary turn lane that extends beyond the applicant property frontage, the applicant will be responsible for acquiring the necessary rights of way and easements in order to accomplish the necessary frontage improvements. 
Sec. 10-4068. - Minimum requirements for deceleration lanes. 
    The provisions of this section shall generally apply to auxiliary lanes installed on the approach to an intersection that provide for deceleration and storage of vehicles waiting to turn right or left. Such lanes are always beneficial and will be required in conjunction with commercial driveway permits when projected traffic volumes exceed minimum levels as provided in the sections below. 
    Right turn deceleration lanes must be constructed at no cost to the City if either the Average Daily Traffic (ADT) or right turning volumes shown in Table 10 are met. Passing lane sections fall under the criteria for two or more lanes. 
Two lanes on main road More than two lanes

Table 10: Minimum Volumes Requiring Deceleration Lanes 
    In the event the Director of Public Works feels that field conditions or other factors indicate that it would be in the best interest of the City to waive the decel lane requirement, the Director of Public Works must document the recommendations. The recommendations shall be approved by the Director of Public Works and be attached to the Permit. The Director of Public Works may also require the addition of a right turn lane, even when the conditions in Table 10 are not met, if roadway geometry or field conditions indicate that the safety of the traveling public would be improved. The recommendation must be documented and approved by the Director of Public Works for inclusion with the Permit. 
    The right of way for deceleration lanes may be dedicated in fee simple to the City for the City to maintain or the applicant must sign an agreement with the City to maintain the lane to the City's standards and to hold harmless the City in the event that section of roadway is identified in any liability action. A Limited Warranty Deed is not acceptable when right of way is donated to the City. 
    The pavement specifications for deceleration lanes must be Georgia DOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, except as approved by the Director of Public Works in cases where a lesser design may be acceptable or where a proposed project is expected to tie in. 
Sec. 10-4069. - Deceleration lane design. 
    This section provides the design guidelines that should be used to establish the lengths of turn lanes if they are required. Turn lanes should provide a full-width lane that is long enough to allow for vehicles to decelerate from the operating speed to a full stop in addition to the length of full-width lane that is needed to store vehicles waiting to turn. Table 11 contains guidelines for lengths of tapers and full-width turn lanes for deceleration right turn lanes. 
Speed, mph Full Width Storage, ft Taper, Ft 35 100  50 40 150  50 45 175 100 50 225 100 55 250 100 60 300 100 65 350 100  
Table 11: Minimum Deceleration Lane Lengths 
    When traffic studies are conducted, the length of full-width lane needed for storage should be determined. If the length of full-width storage is greater than the length of full-width storage shown in Table 11, the longer length should be provided. 
    At signalized intersections, the amount of storage for both right and left turns can be based on the number of vehicles arriving during 1.5 signal cycles. 
    For unsignalized intersections, a commonly used rule of thumb is that left turn storage should accommodate vehicles arriving during a two-minute period. Minimal storage is required for right turn lanes at unsignalized intersections. 
Sec. 10-4070. - Minimum requirements for left turn lanes. 
    Left turn lanes must be constructed at no cost to the City if either the ADT or left turning volumes shown in Table 12 are met. Passing lane sections fall under the criteria for two or more lanes. 
Two lanes on main road More than two lanes on main road 35-40 mph >40 mph 35-40 mph >40 mph Main Roadway ADT 6,000  4,000  12,000  10,000  Daily Right Turning Volume  300  200  300  200  Peak Hour Right Turning Volume 30  20  30  20   
Table 12: Minimum Volumes Requiring Left Turn Lanes 
    In the event the East Point Traffic Engineer feels that field conditions or other factors indicate that it would be in the best interest of the City to waive the left turn lane requirement, the Director of Public Works must document the recommendations. The recommendations shall be approved by the Director of Public Works and be attached to the Permit. The Director of Public Works may also require the addition of a right turn lane, even when the conditions in Table 12 are not met, if roadway geometry or field conditions indicate that the safety of the traveling public would be improved. The recommendation must be documented and approved by the Director of Public Works for inclusion with the Permit. 
Sec. 10-4071. - Left turn lane design. 
    The design of left turn lanes should consider the intended function and the characteristics of the roadway. In many cases, it is necessary to widen the existing roadway to introduce the left turn lane. All vehicles approaching the turn lane are shifted to the right. The left turning traffic is then shifted back into the lane. Through traffic is returned to its original lane beyond the intersection. When the roadway has a median that is at least 20 feet wide, the left turn lane can be developed out of the median, avoiding the need for transitions. If a proposed driveway aligns across the main street with another driveway, and the proposed driveway must provide a left turn lane and left turn storage, then adequate storage and tapers must also be provided for the driveway across the main street. 
    The basic design elements of left turn lanes are illustrated in Table 13. This example shows symmetrical widening, which basically requires the through traffic on each side to shift by one half of the lane width. Some circumstances may dictate that all widening be achieved on one side, which requires a full lane shift for through traffic on the side where the additional width is developed. Table 13 provides guidelines for selecting the proper length of approach taper. 

Posted Speed 
Limit (MPH) Approach Taper in Feet Bay Taper in Feet Full Width 
Storage 6' Shift 12' Shift 35 125 180  50 See Table 14 40 160 250  50 See Table 14 45 270 320 100 See Table 14 50 300 540 100 See Table 14 55 330 600 100 See Table 14  
Table 13: Minimum Design Elements of Left Turn Lanes 
    The example shown in Table 13 has straight-line tapers. These are acceptable but other designs may also be used, including the following: partial tangent tapers, symmetrical reverse curve, and asymmetrical reverse curve. See latest edition of AASHTO green book for details. 
    The required length of full-width storage is based on the peak hour traffic volumes. This should be determined in the traffic study. The amount of storage is dependent on the type of traffic control in effect. For signalized intersections, the storage should be sufficient to accommodate the 95th percentile peak hour queue. At yield-controlled intersections, the storage is based on the number of vehicles as designated in Table 14.

Table 14: Left Turn Storage Requirements 
Sec. 10-4072. - Raised islands. 
    Islands are an important form of intersection channelization that is often needed to prohibit undesirable movements, define the paths of allowed movements, and provide a refuge area for pedestrians. Any location where two outbound lanes are proposed for a driveway at an unsignalized location, the right line must be for right-out only movement, and separated from the other lane by a raised island. 
    Painted lines are an effective means to direct the paths of vehicular movement. However, raised islands are more effective during times when visibility is reduced. When islands are to serve as pedestrian refuge areas, they should be constructed as raised islands. All sign posts to be placed within concrete area must have hole through pavement structure. The hole may be either formed, drilled or sawed. 
    Raised islands should be large enough to command attention and accommodate wheelchairs. The smallest raised island should have an area of 50 square feet in urban areas and 75 square feet in rural areas. However, 100 square feet is desirable in both cases. (Refer to revised ADA standards) 
    When multiple crosswalks are required to pass through islands, the required size may exceed the (100 square feet mentioned above) The additional area may be required to install wheelchair ramps. As an alternate to ramps, the pedestrian travel way can be "slotted" through the island, remaining on the grade of the roadway. 
    Figure 4 shows a typical design for a raised corner island at a two-lane driveway. This design uses a radius of 65 feet and provides an island of sufficient size for wheelchair ramps and level landings. 
    Figure 4 also contains a median island along the driveway. This drawing does not imply that median islands or corner islands are required for all driveways. However, large painted islands may not serve the intended channelization purpose and the type island to be used should be based on the actual circumstances of the site. 
    Raised islands should be offset from the edge of the adjacent travel lane on all sides. The amount of offset shall be a minimum of 18 inches as measured from the edge of the travel lane to the face of the curb. When raised islands are adjacent to roadways with posted speed limits of 50 MPH or greater, the island shall be offset from the edge of the roadway by a minimum distance of ten feet. 

Figure 4: Design of Raised Islands 
Sec. 10-4073. - Right-in, right-out driveways. 
    Raised islands are also typically used to channelize the movements at a driveway where only right turns are allowed. The raised island is an effective means of preventing left turns. All right-in, right-out islands must have a radius that is 70 feet or a compound curve that approximates 70 feet. Right-in, right-out driveways are not intended for truck traffic, so the exit and entrance lanes must be 12' in width as measured from face of curb to face of curb. The island must be constructed from mountable curb (three inches vertical, 45 degree face, three inches flat) to accommodate emergency vehicles. The edge of the island should be offset 18 inches to 24 inches from the edge of the travel lane. 
Sec. 10-4074. - Pavement design. 
    All construction, within the right of way, of surfaces intended for travel by motorized vehicles shall be paved. The pavement specification of auxiliary lanes on City roadways shall be the Georgia DOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, or as designated in East Point Standards, whichever is more restrictive. 
    New developments are required to widen the road along their frontage to a uniform lane width of 12 feet. If the widened area is two feet or less in width, a concrete sub-base should be provided per the current standards. The developer must then either pave the entire width of the road, or mill to the centerline and pave to match the existing road. Any deviation from this standard requires a waiver from the Director of Public Works or his designee. 
Sec. 10-4075. - Pedestrian considerations. 
    When driveways are constructed in areas where pedestrian activity is not prohibited, the design should adequately provide for pedestrian movement and interaction with vehicular traffic. Pedestrian features that should be considered include sidewalks, crosswalks, traffic control features, and curb ramps are required. The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines must be utilized where pedestrian traffic is expected. 
    Figure 5 contains typical locations for curb cut ramps. Ramps are required at all pedestrian crosswalks where curb is constructed or replaced. The required crosswalk detail is also shown in Figure 5. See current GDOT Construction Details for the appropriate treatment. 

Figure 5: Typical Crosswalk Details 
Sec. 10-4076. - Clear zone requirements. 
    Experience has shown that motorists occasionally run off the roadway and providing a traversable recovery area can lesson serious injury. AASHTO publishes a Roadside Design Guide that should be used as a reference when designing driveways. 
    Table 15 provides the clear zone distances as contained in the Roadside Design Guide. Driveways must be designed so that all areas within the roadway right of way have clear zones as defined in Table 15. 
(from AASHTO 2002 Roadside Design Guide)

Table 15: Clear Zone Distances (in Feet from Edge of Traveled Way) 
Notes: 
* Clear zones may be limited to 30' 
** Fixed objects should not be present in the vicinity of the toe of these slopes. The width of the recovery zones should consider a number of factors including right of way availability, economic factors, safety needs, and accident history. 
    All areas located within the clear zones should remain clear of obstructions such as bridge abutments, poles, trees, etc. If obstructions are unavoidable, the design should include appropriate protection such as break-away design, guardrail installation, safety end treatments on culverts, etc. The Roadway Design Guide includes a table for horizontal curve adjustments, where the clear zone correction factor is applied to the outside of curves only. Curves flatter than a 2860 foot radius do not require an adjusted clear zone. 
Sec. 10-4077. - Right of way requirements. 
    In order to construct driveways, it is often necessary to construct improvements to the City roadway. These improvements typically include the addition of lanes along the City roadway such as a deceleration lane. 
    If sufficient right of way exists, improvements to the City roadway may be permitted without the requirement of additional right of way. In urban sections, the right of way should be no closer than 14 feet from the face of curb along State Routes and 11' from the face of curb along all City roads. In rural sections, the point located one-half way up the back slope should be on or within the right of way line. Sufficient right of way should be donated to the City for the deceleration lane/commercial driveway. Paving specifications to match existing pavement or better should be full-depth to the right of way line. Depths may be reduced, if field conditions warrant, as approved by the Director of Public Works. 
    If additional right of way is required in order to construct the required improvements, the applicant must dedicate the right of way. The applicant must follow the procedures established in the Department of Planning and Zoning. 
Sec. 10-4078. - Signing and marking. 
    All signing and pavement marking must be designed and installed in conformance with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
Sec. 10-4079. - Signing. 
    All sign posts to be placed within concrete area must have six-inch wide diameter space through substructure. 
    The traffic control signs must be installed per the most recent edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) with relation to the installation height, size, distance from curb, etc. In general, signs should be installed at least seven feet but no more than ten feet from the ground to the bottom of the sign, and at least two feet from the face of curb to the closest edge of the sign, or as required by the MUTCD. 
    The signs shall be new die cut anodized aluminum (at least .080 inches thick) and installed on a single square post with standard hardware. This post should be installed to break-away standards with a slip base. The back of the installation bolts should be bent to discourage theft. The face of the sign shall be Type III (High-Intensity) sheeting or better. If the road intersects a state route, all warning signs, red series regulatory signs, including Stop, Yield, and Do Not Enter signs shall be fabricated from Type VI (Wide Angle Prismatic) reflective sheeting. No two signs shall be mounted on the same post. Should the applicant wish to use decorative poles, a custom sign permit will need to be applied for in the Department of Public Works. 
    As part of the Land Disturbance Permit Process, the Department of Planning and Zoning will identify the number and location of signs. The minimum sign installation shall conform to the standards established below. 
    The applicant will be responsible for maintaining the signs from installation to final inspection. The City reserves the right to replace stop or yield signs if they have been down for more than 12 hours, to replace any regulatory signs if they have been down for more than seven days, and to replace any other signs if they have been down for more than 14 days. This will be done at the cost to the applicant of $250.00 per sign. 
    The sign inspection shall be done by the Planning and Zoning Department prior to acceptance of the final plat or as established by the Director of Planning and Zoning. The signs should be performance bonded at the same time as the pavement at a cost of $100.00 per sign or as established by the Director of Planning and Zoning. If the City needs to replace any signs at the time of the final inspection, the value would be forfeited. 
    The following signs shall be installed in all new subdivisions as applicable: 
Sec. 10-4080. - Stop signs (R1-1). 
    The STOP sign shall be installed on the right side of the approach to which it applies. Stop lines, when used to supplement a STOP sign, should be located at the point where the road user should stop. Where there is a marked crosswalk at the intersection, the STOP sign should be installed in advance of the crosswalk line nearest to the approaching traffic. 
    STOP signs should be installed in a manner that minimizes the numbers of vehicles having to stop. In most cases, the street carrying the lowest volume of traffic should be stopped. A STOP sign should not be installed on the major street unless justified by a traffic engineering study as recommended by the MUTCD. If two streets with relatively equal volumes and/or characteristics intersect, typically the direction that conflicts the most with established pedestrian crossing activity or school walking routes or the direction that has the longest distance of uninterrupted flow approaching the intersection should be stopped. 
    No all-way stops may be installed in a new subdivision without the permission of the Director of Public Works. 
Sec. 10-4081. - Yield sign (R1-2). 
    Yield signs shall be installed when there are right turns at an intersection that are channelized apart from the through and/or left turn movements with a striped or raised island. In addition, yield signs should be installed on each approach of a roundabout. 
Sec. 10-4082. - Right lane must turn right sign (R3-7R). 
    Right Lane Must Turn Right signs shall be installed 25 feet from the back of the full width storage in the deceleration lane for the development, if applicable. 
Sec. 10-4083. - Speed limit sign (R2-1). 
    Speed Limit signs shall indicate a 25 mph speed limit for streets internal to residential subdivisions, unless it is a local collector road for the development, and then it should be no higher than 35 mph. For neighborhood settings, only one speed limit sign shall be installed at each project entrance or at the points of change from one speed limit to another. This sign should be installed no less than 100 feet from the entrance of the subdivision, but no greater than 500 feet from the entrance. 
Sec. 10-4084. - Street name sign (D3-1). 
    Ground-mounted street name signs shall be installed at every intersection and shall conform to City of East Point Department of Public Works requirements. Instead of ground-mounted signs, however, overhead street name signs shall be installed where a subdivision street intersects at any traffic signal. Overhead street name signs shall include the City of East Point logo. 
    Street name signs for public roads shall be green and street name signs for private roads shall be blue. The letter height must have at least seven-inch upper-case letters and at least five-inch lower-case letters. The Letters should be in "Avantage Medium" font or as approved by the Department of Public Works. The street name sign shall be a combination of lower-case letters with initial uppercase letters. If the street has no outlet, a "No Outlet" legend should be put on the end of the street name sign blade closest to the main road. The "No Outlet" legend should have at least three inch high all-capital black letters on a yellow field that is no more than eight inches wide. 
    The street name sign should be constructed on flat blades and not extruded blades. They may be either riveted back-to-back or two-sided at the applicant's preference. The street name sign cannot be posted on the same post as the stop sign. 
Sec. 10-4085. - Roundabout sign. 
    Roundabouts must be signed and marked per East Point standards. This includes yield signs for every approach, as well as an advance roundabout sign as established by the Department of Public Works. The pavement marking shall include yield lines and channelization islands for each approach. 
Sec. 10-4086. - Stop ahead sign (W3-1) and yield ahead sign (W3-2). 
    The Stop Ahead and Yield Ahead signs shall be installed on an approach to a primary traffic control device that is not visible for at least 250 feet. Please refer to Section Tables 2C.29 in the MUTCD for additional information. 
Sec. 10-4087. - Playground sign (W15-1). 
    Playground signs shall be installed on any vehicular approach to an amenities area. 
Sec. 10-4088. - Additional signs. 
    Additional signs may be required as appropriate by the Department of Public Works or the field inspector. 
Sec. 10-4089. - Sign information and sizes. 
    All signs shall be of the sizes as designated in Table 16. This table also included the appropriate reference sections of the MUTCD which explain the proper use and installation of each of the signs previously designated.

Sec. 10-4090. - Pavement marking. 
    Pavement markings are required to separate lanes of travel and should be used along all edges of pavement. The following guidelines are provided for designing and installing pavement markings for driveways: 
  All pavement markings installed within the public right-of-way shall be thermoplastic material 
  Lane lines are generally 5" (white); lane lines are not required where curb and gutter has been provided 
  Stop lines should be 24" (white) 
  Center lines should be 5" double yellow 
  Deceleration and left turn lanes should have turn arrows (Type 2) spaced every 100' and 
    "ONLY" legends between every pair of Type 2 Arrows 
  Crosswalks should use the current Georgia DOT standard (see Figure 5) 
ARTICLE J. - INFILL 

Sec. 10-4091. - Definitions. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "Infill" shall apply to all residential zoning categories excluding Townhomes (TH) and Apartments. 
(2)  For the purposes of this section, Accessory Structure shall mean- detached garages, carports, storage sheds, etc. and shall meet the minimum setback requirements prescribed by the applicable zoning district. Said structures shall be constructed of similar building materials and orientation of the principal structure. 
(3)  For the purposes of this section, the term "Infill Development" shall mean the construction and/or reconstruction of at least 25 percent of the exterior of a residential structure. Infill Development shall be required if a developer is building five or less homes. A single-family detached structure constructed on three acres or more is exempt from this ordinance. 
(4)  For purposes of this section, the term "Survey Area" shall mean: 
(a)  The three nearest homes on both sides of the lot to be developed; 
(b)  Any home directly to the rear of the lot to be developed; and 
(c)  The six homes directly across the public right-of-way to the front of the lot to be developed. 
In the event that topography, zoning district boundaries, city limits, or other logistical matters render strict compliance with a. and/or b. above impossible, the Director of Planning and Zoning shall determine the Survey Area as strictly as possible in compliance with 4a. and 4b. as stated above. 
(i)  In order to establish and maintain compatibility among residential developments and to preserve the aesthetic qualities of neighborhoods, which serves to preserve the property values of all residential land owners and developers, promote the health, welfare and safety of neighborhoods, and preserve the tax base of the City of East Point, the following design requirements are hereby mandated for all residential infill developments, in addition to all other construction standards contained in this Code. 
(ii)  The developer of a proposed Infill Development shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Department, an Infill Compatibility Survey, on the form provided by the Planning and Zoning Department that illustrates the size, scale, and overall visual character of the structure including setbacks, height and basic architectural features of homes in the survey area. The applicant shall also submit labeled pictures of the survey area. 
(5)  The minimum requirements for residential Infill Development, to be shown on the Infill Compatibility Survey, shall be as follows: 
(a)  Height. The maximum height is measured between the highest point along a roof or highest ridge line of a proposed home, and the slab or crawl space on grade. The height shall comply with the requirements of the applicable zoning district. For purposes of building height, chimneys, as well as flues, vents, pipes, antennae, and other small projections less than 24 inches in width/diameter (measured at the widest point) shall not be included in the above measurement. 
(b)  Number of stories. The number of stores shall comply with the height requirements of the applicable zoning district. 
(c)  Orientation of the front door. The home shall have its front entrance facing the street (if the lot faces more than one street, then facing the street that existing homes in the survey area face), and shall have no less than 25 square feet of framed window facing said street, or no less than 85 percent of the average square footage of framed window facing said street for homes within the survey area, whichever is less. 
(d)  Orientation of the house. The Infill home shall have the same orientation to the streets as the majority (51 percent) of the existing homes within the survey area. Where the dimensions of the lot, or other site-specific obstacles, do not permit the same orientation as a majority of existing structures in the survey area, the property owner, or his or her representatives, may file for a variance with the Planning and Zoning Commission, which variance shall be considered in conformance with the procedures and standards contained in City Code Part 10, Planning and Development, Chapter 1, Planning and Zoning Commission Powers and Duties in Administration of Zoning Regulations. 
(e)  Garages and carports. Where a majority (51 percent) of existing homes have garages or carports within the survey area, the Infill home shall include a garage or carport. The garage or carport frontage shall meet all setback requirements of the applicable zoning district. The orientation of garages and carports shall be consistent with the majority (51 percent) of such structures within the survey area. Where possible, garages and carports shall be oriented and entered from the side or rear of the Infill home, and out of view of the public way. A detached garage within an Infill Development is considered an accessory structure and must comply with the Infill standards and applicable zoning district. 
(f)  Exterior materials. The exterior materials of an Infill Development, including garages, carports and other accessory structures, shall conform to the following requirements: 
(i)  All exterior finishes shall be either brick, stone, masonry, wood, masonry composite, or such other similar exterior finish as may be approved by the Director of Planning and Zoning. 
(ii)  Where either brick, stone, masonry, wood, or masonry composite is used on a majority (51 percent) of existing homes in the survey area, the Infill Development shall include and reflect the majority (51 percent) of the homes' building materials on the front, sides and rear of the structure as demonstrated in the community and if visible from a public right-of-way. 
(g)  Square footage requirements. The footprint for Infill homes shall be no greater than 50 percent larger than the average footprint for all homes within the survey area, and shall be no smaller than ten percent of the average footprint for all homes within the survey area. The total heated floor area of an Infill home shall be equal to or greater than a majority (51 percent) of the existing homes in the survey area. 
(h)  Foundations. Foundations shall reflect the character and style of homes in the survey area. However, no foundation shall have exposed concrete. Concrete foundations, where exposed, must be covered in stucco, brick or other approved masonry material used in the majority of the homes in the survey area. 
(i)  Fireplaces and chimneys. Where the majority (51 percent) of existing homes in the survey area have fireplaces and chimneys, the Infill home shall include fireplaces and chimneys to reflect the character and style of homes in the survey area. Chimneys shall be covered in stucco, brick or other approved masonry material, unless a different material is used in the majority (51 percent) of the existing homes in the survey area and shall terminate at finished grade. 
(j)  Front porch or stoops. Where the majority (51 percent) of existing homes in the survey area have a functional front porch or stoop, or similar front entry feature, the Infill home shall have such a feature. The inclusion of these features shall be consistent with the setbacks of the applicable zoning district. Architectural features and dimensions shall conform to those of the majority (51 percent) of homes in the survey area. 
(k)  Overhangs. The roofs of all Infill homes shall be constructed in such a manner as to provide soffits (i.e. the horizontal underside of the eaves) that extend a maximum horizontal distance of one foot beyond the face of the exterior walls. 
(l)  Lot frontage. Lot frontage for Infill homes shall not vary more than ten percent from the average lot frontage of existing homes in the survey area. 
(5)  Relief. To apply for relief from any of these requirements, the property owner, or his or her representatives, may file for a variance with the Planning and Zoning Commission. That variance shall be considered in conformance with the procedures and standards contained in City Code Part 10, Planning and Development, Chapter 1, Planning and Zoning Commission. 
Sec. 10-4092. - Public participation program. 
    The public participation program is in place to ensure that applicants pursue early effective public involvement in conjunction with their petitions, ensure that the citizens of East Point have an adequate opportunity to learn about petitions that may affect them, and to ensure ongoing communication between applicants, adjoining property owners, neighborhood groups, community associations and other organizations, elected officials and city staff. A minimum target area for public participation shall be a 500-foot radius from the affected property. At the Director of Planning and Zoning's discretion, a greater distance may be required. Applicants are required to submit a public participation plan for meeting with interested citizens to advise residents of residential infill applications and to allow citizens the opportunity to discuss concerns and provide input about project design or development. An applicant's responsibilities are to inform the public, solicit input, and provide a summary of these activities in the form of a written report. 
    The requirement for a public participation plan does not give communities decision making powers. Applicants are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and seek to reach a consensus on the outstanding issues. A refusal by the community to meet with applicants or to return the completed and signed Departmental documents does not mean that the applicants fail to meet the requirements of the public participation program. 
    Public participation plans are required with all residential infill applications and must be filed simultaneously with the application. An application for building permit may be denied by the Department of Planning and Zoning if the report is not submitted as required. 
Sec. 10-4093. - Public participation plan. 
    Every application for residential infill shall include a public participation plan. 
    Minimum Standards: 
(1)  Identification of all property owners within 500-foot radius of the site, area neighborhood groups, community associations, other organizations and any political subdivision of the state (elected council ward representatives) which may be affected by an application. 
(2)  Detailed explanation of how interested parties will be informed of a residential infill. 
(3)  Methods for providing opportunities for discussion with interested parties before meetings are held. Applicants are required to schedule at least one meeting at a convenient location and time and notify all interested parties of the purpose, place and time of meeting. 
(4)  Applicant's schedule for completion of the public participation plan. 
(5)  Site plan and sketches, including at least the building footprint and front and side elevations, of any structure to be built. 
Sec. 10-4094. - Public participation plan report. 
    Every application for residential infill is required to provide a public participation report which shall include the items listed below: 
(1)  Provide a list of all parties that were contacted, the methods of notification that were used, and copies of all notification letters. 
(2)  Provide a copy of letter of notification to impacted adjacent property owner. 
(3)  Provide dates and locations of all community and/or other meetings that were attended by the applicant to discuss an application (Attach meeting notices, letters, etc.) 
(4)  Provide the number of people who participated in meetings held to discuss an application. (Attach sign-in sheets) 
(5)  A summary of concerns and issues expressed by interested parties. 
(6)  A summary of the applicant's response to concerns and issues. 
(7)  A signed copy of the Notification form, signed by both the applicant and a representative of the community presented to. 
(8)  Applicant shall attach a copy of the development plan presented to the community representative. 
(9)  Applicant shall bring to the community meeting copies of the plan which can be distributed and kept by the community. (Size not to exceed 11 × 17 inches) 
(10)  Applicant shall conduct an additional community meeting if any modifications are made to the application after it has been reviewed by the appropriate property owners, neighborhood groups, community associations other organizations and any political subdivision of the state (elected council ward representatives) affected by the application. 
Sec. 10-4095. - Community responsibility. 
    The affected community shall also fax, mail, e-mail or hand deliver to the Department of Planning and Zoning a copy of the signed form by both parties in order to insure that the information submitted by the applicant reflects what was presented to the community. The form must be submitted within five days after the scheduled community meeting. 
ARTICLE K. - DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 10-4096. - Scope and intent. 
    This article includes a variety of development related regulations which are designed to insure that development, and infrastructure additions and improvements are provided in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of East Point, and to assure that development regulations and review procedures are standardized and equitably applied. 
Sec. 10-4097. - Compliance. 
    Any land disturbance activity or any development activity must comply with the development standards of East Point along with any other applicable local or state regulations.

Chapter 5 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 005-13, adopted March 18, 2013, amended and restated former Ch. 5, Arts. A-E, in its entirety which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 003-09, Exh. A, adopted March 2, 2009. 

ARTICLE A. - GENERAL 

Sec. 10-5001. - Findings. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of East Point are subject to periodic inundation that may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity of flood waters, debris or erosion potential. Floodways must remain free of encroachment to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. 
(3)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
(4)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(5)  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of East Point, Georgia, does ordain this chapter and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
(Ord. No. 005-13, 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-5002. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
(6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
(Ord. No. 005-13, 3-18-13)

(Ord. No. 005-13, 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-5008. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the Areas of Special Flood Hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of East Point or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.

    Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) -see "area of special flood hazard." 
    Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. For this purpose, the market value does not include the cost of the land on which the structure resides. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without a completed FEMA Elevation Certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE E. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 10-5052. - Variances. 
    The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the Public Works Department or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
(1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the Public Works Department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the Public Works Department. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the Public Works Department shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Mayor and City Council or their designee as established by the City in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the Mayor and City Council or their designee. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Mayor and City Council or their designee may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Fulton County, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and future-conditions base flood, and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the Public Works Department and the Mayor and City Council or their designee shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. In addition, the notice will specify the future-conditions base flood elevation, indicating the potential for an even higher cost of flood insurance in the future. 
d.  The Public Works Department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the Public Works Department and the Mayor and City Council or their designee shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the Public Works Department and the Mayor and City Council or their designee may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
(11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

Chapter 6 - TREE PROTECTION AND LANDSCAPING 

Sec. 10-6001. - Purpose. 
    This Tree Protection and Landscaping Ordinance is developed to benefit the environmental and aesthetic quality of East Point. The intent is to create an opportunity and promote preservation of the city's natural resources and grow in a way that will provide a healthy environment for the city's future. The purpose is to provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development process; to prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; and to protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the city. The regulations of this Tree Protection and Landscaping Ordinance shall be definitive, unless otherwise directed by the Zoning Ordinance. The benefits derived from this ordinance include: 
(a)  Provide visual buffering and enhance beautification of the city; 
(b)  Moderation of storm water runoff, and improved water quality; 
(c)  Protect and attempt to enhance property values, thus safeguarding private and public investment; 
(d)  Protect the unique identity of the city by promoting native plants and the use of the city's signature plant palette; 
(e)  Control soil erosion; 
(f)  Reduction of some air pollutants and interception of airborne particulate matter; 
(g)  Preserve stands of trees and "specimen" trees; and 
(h)  Protect natural vegetation except where its removal is necessary for responsible property development or control of disease and infestation. This article shall serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing of land and its disturbance, so as to preserve, insofar as possible, the natural and existing growth of vegetation, and to replace whenever possible the removed foliage with new vegetation. 
Sec. 10-6002. - Definitions. 
    Buffer: 
(a)  State waters buffer: An area along the course of any State waters to be maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition.

Sec. 10-6012. - Tree survey required. 
(1)  Survey required. Unless specifically exempted from this article, before the commencement of any alteration, defoliation or land disturbing activity which requires the issuance of a permit, a tree survey shall be completed by a certified arborist and submitted to the Department of Planning and Zoning in accordance with the requirements. When an application for a preliminary plat is made, the applicant shall be required to submit a tree survey. 
(2)  Survey requirements. The tree survey shall be in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan prepared and sealed by an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture noting the location of all specimen trees plus all other trees which will be preserved. Important natural features such as streams and wetlands shall also be shown on the tree survey. 
(3)  Specimen trees. All specimen trees and their critical root zones and drip lines shall be labeled, even if the tree trunk is not on the subject property, and must be shown on the tree survey and inventoried by size and species. This includes those specimen trees that are to be preserved as well as those proposed for removal, if any, and the portion of critical root zones and drip lines of trees on abutting properties which are contained within the subject property, to the extent that such drip lines and critical root zones can be determined from the vantage point of the property to be developed. This provision shall not authorize the trespass on other private property abutting the site. 
(4)  Other trees to be retained. All other trees that are to be counted toward meeting tree density unit requirements of this article must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and species. Only trees with a caliper measurement of three inches or greater are to be identified as eligible for tree density unit compliance purposes. 
(5)  Trees to be removed. Trees other than specimen trees that are proposed to be removed and which thus cannot be counted toward tree density unit requirements are not required to be counted and shown individually on the tree survey. Such trees shall be estimated in number, size and species of such trees and quantified as part of the total site inventory of tree population. 
(6)  Sampling. Sampling methods may be used to determine tree densities for forested areas over two acres. 
(7)  Tree save areas. All tree save areas must be delineated on the tree survey. All buffers with existing trees must be delineated on the tree survey as tree save areas. Land disturbance within any buffer is subject to approval by the Planning and Zoning Department. 
(8)  List and tree density unit calculations. The tree survey shall provide an accurate list of those trees to be saved and a total value of tree density units for the entire property. 
Sec. 10-6013. - Tree protection plan specifications.

(1)  Separate drawing. The Tree Protection Plan shall be submitted as a separate drawing. 
(2)  Boundary survey. The Tree Protection Plan shall be submitted on a current boundary survey of the proposed site, drawn to scale, and showing clearly all required information in this Section. 
(3)  Tract identification. The plan shall identity the tract of land involved by acreage and location. 
(4)  Owner and contact. The name, address and phone number of the owner of the land and the name, address and phone number of any tenant of the property, and 24 hour emergency contact phone number. 
(5)  Trees to be protected. The type, location and size as measured at the diameter breast height of all tree(s) to be protected. Only trees designated on the approved Tree Protection Plan will be counted toward meeting minimum required tree density requirements. 
(6)  Specimen trees. Locations, species, size, critical root zones, and drip lines of those specimen trees proposed and, if any, proposed to be removed. The Tree Protection Plan must include any portion of a critical root zone or drip line of any trees on abutting properties proposed to be protected. Removal of specimen trees is subject to approval by the Director of Planning Zoning. 
(7)  Tree save areas and clearing limits. All natural areas to be retained and buffers shall be included in the tree save area. There shall be no material storage in tree save areas. Limits of clearing and land disturbance such as grading, trenching, etc. where these disturbances may affect tree save areas shall also be shown, including an indication of staging areas for parking, material storage, concrete washout, debris burn and burial holes and other areas where tree protection may be affected.

(12)  Irrigation systems. The Tree Protection Plan must also indicate any irrigation systems required by this Ordinance. 
(13)  Additional information. Additional information as required on a case-by-case basis by the Director of Planning and Zoning. 
Sec. 10-6014. - Planning and Zoning authority and action on a tree protection plan. 
    Prior to approval of the Tree Protection Plan, the Planning and Zoning staff may require relocation or replacement of trees as uniformly as possible throughout the site. The planning and zoning staff may require the use of active tree protection fencing for any or all tree save areas. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity. 
    Standards for tree protection during construction: 
(1)  Materials prohibited in tree save areas. No structure(s), improvement(s), or any activity including solvents, material, construction machinery, portable toilets, construction trailers, or temporary soil deposits shall encroach or be placed within a drip line and within six feet of the area immediately outside the drip line, of any specimen tree or any tree within a tree save area unless authorized by the Planning and Zoning staff in writing. 
(2)  Tree protection devices. Before development, land clearing, filling, or any land alteration, the developer shall be required to erect suitable protective barriers as required by the Planning and Zoning staff pursuant to an approved Tree Protection Plan, including tree fences, tree protection signs, and erosion barriers. Inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to the commencement of any land disturbance or development. Said tree protection measures shall remain in functioning condition until completion of site landscaping, completion of the project or until the Certificate of Occupancy is issued. Authorization to remove the protective devices shall be evidenced in writing by the Planning and Zoning staff or by the issuance of a final Certificate of Occupancy. 
(3)  Active tree protection devices. Materials for active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing, where active tree protection is required, each tree to be saved shall be marked at the base of the trunk with blue colored water-based paint. 
(4)  Passive tree protection. Materials for passive tree protection shall consist of heavy mil plastic flagging, a minimum of four inches wide with dark letters reading "Tree Protection Area - Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint. 
(5)  Additional measures. The developer shall take measures to ensure the health of the protected trees during construction, including but not limited to the following measures: 
(a)  Water, fertilize and treat the trees for pests or disease as needed, in accordance with standards of the International Society of Arboriculture. 
(b)  If grading covers the trees with dust, hose them off. 
(c)  Do not randomly or incorrectly prune live branches so that equipment or structures can "fit" within the tree's protected zone. 
(d)  Do not strip the topsoil or remove the natural leaf mulch or material from beneath a protected tree. 
(e)  Trees should be felled away from, rather than into, tree save areas. 
(f)  Provide adequate mulching and water for trees that will be retained. 
Sec. 10-6015. - Tree damage. 
    Any tree, designated on a tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the Department of Planning and Zoning, shall be treated according to accepted standards of the National Arborists Association, or replaced with a tree or trees equal to the tree density unit value of the tree removed. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equal to two times the unit value of the tree removed or damaged. If a damaged specimen tree must be removed, the area occupied by its drip line must remain in a pervious state. A replacement plan for such area must be approved by the Department of Planning and Zoning. 
Sec. 10-6016. - Pruning. 
(a)  Pruning shall not cause long-term health or structural problems and must be done in accordance with International Society of Arboriculture Standards (ANSI A300) standards. 
Example: The pruning cut should not be too large when compared to the growing point. For instance, a large cut on a 20 cm trunk down to a 15 cm branch should be fine, but the same cut to the trunk down to a one cm twig or bud is considerably less ideal and should be avoided. 
(b)  "Topping" or severe pruning is prohibited. Severe pruning seriously affects a tree's food supply, can scald the newly exposed outer bark, make trees vulnerable to insect invasion, stimulate the regrowth of dense, upright branches below the pruning cut, make the tree more vulnerable to wind damage, disfigure the tree aesthetically, and sometimes result in the death of the tree. 
Sec. 10-6017. - Removal of specimen trees. 
    Unless specifically exempted from the requirements of this Ordinance, no specimen tree as defined by this Ordinance shall be removed except in accordance with this section. 
(a)  Justification for removal. Any applicant proposing to remove a specimen tree(s) regulated by this Ordinance shall apply for a tree removal permit. In addition to the requirements for tree removal permits specified by this Ordinance, the applicant shall provide a written explanation as to why the specimen tree(s) cannot be retained on the site which shall include a description of all alternative site development plans considered by the applicant to avoid the removal of said specimen tree(s). 
Said written explanation shall at minimum include the following: 
(1)  Consideration of whether any buildings or structures, parking areas, storm water facilities, utilities, driveways, or other features of the proposed development can be relocated or designed to retain the specimen tree(s), and the additional costs of such relocations or design, if any. 
(2)  Consideration of whether the land area consumed by the proposed development can be reduced via decked parking, reduction of the footprint of a building or structure by increasing the height or number of stories, placement of storm water facilities underground, and other appropriate means, to retain the specimen tree(s), and the additional costs involved in such surface area consumption, if any. 
(3)  Consideration of whether the development proposal can be reduced in size, scale, or extent without jeopardizing the economic feasibility of the proposed development. 
(4)  The total estimated value of the development before approval and upon completion as proposed, if approved. 
(5)  Explanation must be written by a certified arborist. 
(b)  Director of Planning and Zoning approval. An application to remove a specimen tree shall require the approval of the Director of Planning and Zoning. The Director of Planning and Zoning may also consult with the City Engineer in determining the accuracy of cost estimates submitted in the applicant's written analysis. The Director of Planning and Zoning may issue a permit to remove specimen trees after finding that one or more of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The written analysis provides convincing evidence that alternative site and building designs have been considered by the applicant but would not result in retention of the specimen tree(s). 
(2)  The additional cost associated with developing the site or constructing buildings as redesigned or reducing the site area consumed to retain the specimen tree(s) would be disproportional to the value of the specimen tree(s) retained, calculated at $100.00 per tree density unit. 
(3)  Retention of the specimen tree(s) would result in a less than viable economic use of the subject property. 
(4)  If more than one specimen tree is proposed to be removed, the site design results in the minimum number of specimen trees removed that are necessary to accommodate the proposed development. 
(5)  A variance to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance may be an appropriate remedy to preserve a specimen tree. Where in the opinion of the Director of Planning and Zoning one or more variances would enable a site and building design to be accomplished while saving one or more specimen trees, and where the objectives of tree protection would outweigh the purposes of the zoning regulations that would be varied, the Director of Planning and Zoning may suggest an applicant apply for variances instead of proposing to remove one or more specimen trees. A determination by the Director of Planning and Zoning that one or more variances to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance would not be appropriate may support a finding by the Director of Planning and Zoning in favor of granting approval to remove one or more specimen trees. 
(6)  The request to remove a specimen tree or trees is reasonable considering the remaining specimen trees on the site that will be retained. 
(7)  The Director of Planning and Zoning may apply any or all decision criteria for the removal of trees as specified in this Ordinance. The Director of Planning and Zoning may approve or deny an application for a tree removal permit based on the above referenced criteria. The determination of the Director of Planning and Zoning pursuant to this provision may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
(c)  Tree bank contribution. When removal of a specimen tree(s) is approved by the Director of Planning and Zoning, as a condition precedent to issuing said tree removal permit, the project applicant shall contribute to the City of East Point Tree Bank an amount of $220.00 for each tree density unit of the specimen tree(s) removed, calculated on the basis of Table 2 of this article. In any case where a specimen tree was removed without or prior to a lawfully issued tree removal permit, the amount contributed to the tree bank shall be $1,000.00 per tree density unit of the specimen tree removed. The tree removal permit shall not be issued, nor shall the specimen tree(s) be removed, until funds are received for deposit in the City of East Point Tree Bank. 
(d)  Recompense. Contributions to the East Point Tree Bank may be adjusted by recompense subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Credit, based on the tree density units as specified in Table 3, may be given for new trees planted on the subject site, above and beyond the minimum site density requirement, if approved by the planning and zoning staff. 
(2)  Such newly planted trees shall be of a caliper of three inches or greater. 
(3)  In cases where the obligation is not fully reduced by recompensed trees, the remaining obligation shall be deposited to the East Point Tree Bank and calculated based on $220.00 per density unit. 
Sec. 10-6018. - Criteria for removal of trees. 
    This section is intended to guide the Planning and Zoning staff in considering whether non-specimen trees shall be permitted to be removed. At the discretion of the Director of Planning and Zoning, the provisions of this section may be used along with other criteria in determining whether specimen trees shall be permitted to be removed. 
(a)  Tree removal shall be disallowed if soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to flood plain or river protection areas; or if the removal will substantially alter the existing soils adversely with regard to runoff and erosion. Information submitted by the City Engineer or other environmental specialist may be used by the planning and zoning staff in such an evaluation. 
(b)  Removal of non-specimen trees from a site may be allowed at the discretion of the Planning and Zoning staff if: 
(1)  The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed and the tree cannot be relocated on the site because of age, species, or size of tree. 
(2)  The tree is diseased or structurally unsound. 
(3)  The tree is injured and/or poses an imminent danger. 
(4)  The tree interferes with existing utility service. 
(5)  The tree creates an unsafe vision clearance for vehicular movement. 
Sec. 10-6019. - Establishment of the East Point Tree Bank. 
(a)  There is hereby established an East Point Tree Bank for the maintenance and disbursement of funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. 
(b)  Where it is determined by the Director of Planning and Zoning that payment into the East Point Tree Bank shall be required hereunder, the required funds shall be paid to the East Point Tree Bank prior to issuance of any related permit. 
(c)  Funds maintained in the East Point Tree Bank shall be administered by the Department of Finance pursuant to rules and regulations regarding said funds. 
Sec. 10-6020. - Appeal procedure. 
(a)  Any applicant who is aggrieved or affected by any decision of the of the Department relating to the application of these regulations may file an appeal within 30 days of the decision with the Planning and Zoning Commission through the Director of the Department of Planning and Zoning. 
(b)  Appeals shall only be granted for errors of interpretation, application, or where the unique natural features of the site are such that it is impractical or impossible to apply the terms, conditions or standards of these regulations resulting in an undue hardship to the property owner. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by an action of the Planning and Zoning Commission as it relates to this Ordinance may appeal within 30 days to the Superior Court of Fulton County Georgia by writ of certiorari. 
Sec. 10-6021. - Severability and conflicts. 
    Should any article, clause or provision of this ordinance be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such action shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part hereof so declared to be invalid, it being the intent of the City Council that each article, clause and provision hereof be severable. 
Sec. 10-6022. - Appendix A density factor analysis. 
    A basic condition of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 30 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with "tree". 
    The minimum tree density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two. 
    For density factor analysis, the following formula shall apply: 
SDF = EDF + RDF 
Where: 
SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (30 units per acre). 
EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. 
RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. 
PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE REQUIRED TREE REPLACEMENT: 
Step 1. Calculate the Site Density Factor (SDF): 
The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 30. 
EXAMPLE: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 X 30 = 66 
Step 2. Calculate the Existing Density Factor (EDF): 
The Existing Density Factor, EDF, is determined by converting the diameter breast height (dbh) of individual existing trees to density factor units as shown in the following Table 2. These units are totaled to determine the EDF for the site. 
EXAMPLE: A total of eight existing trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site in 
Step 1. These existing trees include: 
3 - 14" pines 
3 - 18" oaks 
1 - 20" hickory 
1 - 30" oak 
When converted to density factor units using Table 1 (on the following page), we arrive at the following values for existing trees on the site: 
dbh UNITS X NUMBER OF TREES 
14" 4.8 x 3 = 14.4 
18" 5.7 x 3 = 17.1 
20" 6.0 x 1 = 6.0 
36" 8.4 x 1 = 8.4 
45.9 units total 
The total units, 45.9, is the EDF (Existing Density Factor)) This is the density value of existing trees that will remain on the site. 
Step 3. Calculate the Replacement Density Factor (RDF): 
Replacement Density Factor (RDF) is determined by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. 
EXAMPLE: 66 (SDF) - 45.9 (EDF) = 20.1 
TABLE 2 
CONVERTING EXISTING TREE DIAMETERS TO DENSITY UNITS 
DBH Existing Tree Density Units for 
Existing Tree DBH Existing Tree Density Units for

Sec. 10-6024. - Appendix C formula for determining contributions to East Point Tree Bank. 
    The required contribution amount is $220.00 per tree density unit, based on cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the East Point area. 
Example: To determine the appropriate contribution, first calculate the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) or unit value which cannot be planted on the site. 
Determine the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) using the formula: 
DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF 
Where: 
SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (30 units per acre). 
Example: A 2.2 acre site will have a required Site Density Factor of 66.0 units 
(2.2 x 30 = 66). 
EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. The site has existing trees totaling 45.9 units (Existing Density Factor). 
Approved RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. Due to space limitations, the site can only bear 15.0 units as replacement trees. 
Example: 
DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF 
DFD = 66 - 45.9 - 15 
DFD = 5.1 (the number of tree density units that cannot be planted on site) 
This means that the value of 5.1 tree density units must be contributed to the East Point Tree Bank. Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows: 
5.1 tree density units X $220.00 per tree density unit = $1,122.00 
  $1,122.00 = TOTAL CONTRIBUTION TO TREE BANK 
Chapter 7 - SIGNS 

Sec. 10-7001. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. The article is enacted for the following purposes: 
(1)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication; 
(2)  To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development; 
(3)  To improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
(4)  To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions; 
(5)  To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city; 
(6)  To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
(7)  To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs; 
(8)  To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and 
(9)  To make it easy, quick and economically efficient to apply for a sign permit. 
(b)  Findings. 
(1)  The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners' desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
(2)  The city further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of signs for the benefit of all the city's citizens. 
(3)  The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
(4)  Signs and other structures belonging to East Point are exempt from this Ordinance. 
(5)  The city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is often referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, whenever possible, it is the intent of this ordinance to refer to signs unrelated to the content of the speech provided and to allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

(Ord. No. 102-019 , § 2, 1-22-19) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 102-019 , § 2, adopted Jan. 22, 2019, repealed the former § 10-7014, and enacted a new § 10-7014 as set out herein. The former 10-7014 pertained to general sign regulations and derived from the original codification of this code. 
Sec. 10-7015. - Removal of unlawful or dangerous signs. 
(a)  Removal. The city may order the removal of any sign in violation of this article by written notice to the permit holder; or if there is no permit holder, then to the owner of the sign; or if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then to the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. If a permit has been issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit. 
(b)  Procedure following removal order. If the sign is not removed within the time allowable the city shall remove or cause to be removed the sign and collect the costs thereof as provided below. 
(c)  Removal without notice. The city shall have removed any sign in violation of this article, without giving notice to any party, if: 
(1)  Said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property or upon the pavement of a private street or drive; or 
(2)  Said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public. 
(d)  Removal after court determination. Other than signs located in a public right-of-way, a sign shall be removed by the city after a final determination by a court that the sign is unlawful and should be removed. If the permittee or owner fails to remove the sign the sign may be immediately removed and disposed of by the city at the expense of the owner. 
Sec. 10-7016. - Sign specifications. 
    Location: All signs shall be located outside of any public right-of-way except where otherwise specifically permitted by provisions in this article. Any sign placed on public right-of-way except where otherwise permitted by this article shall be deemed illegal and shall be immediately removed by the responsible party or be subject to removal by the appropriate enforcement body. The Department of Planning and Zoning shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such sign the full cost of its removal and disposal. 
    Setback: Unless a more restrictive setback is specified in conditions of zoning, all signs shall set back at least ten feet from the right-of-way or twenty (20) feet from the edge of pavement if a private street sign and no sign shall project over the right-of-way. 
    Height: The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is greater (surveyor's certificate required). Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required). At no time shall any sign's overall height exceed the zoning district's height limitations. 
    Area: Sign area is calculated by squaring the area on one side of all sign faces. Signs are entitled to double faces and signs may have more than one single or double face signs as long as the total area of the single sides do not exceed the maximum sign area allowed. Three and four sided signs are not allowed. Regardless of the geometric configuration of the sign, the sign face shall be calculated by adding the total squared areas of the polygons covering the sign face, including any open space within the polygons. 
    Graphics: Lettering and numerals on signs located next to limited access, arterial and major collector streets shall not exceed eight inches in height and, next to all other streets, lettering and numerals shall not exceed eight inches in height. 
    Safety: No sign shall obstruct or impair the vision of any vehicle operator at the intersection of any public rights-of-way, at any entrance onto or exit from a public road, or any other location where said obstruction could create a traffic hazard. No sign shall be constructed or located where by reason of its position, shape, wording or color, may be confused with an authorized traffic or emergency vehicle device. All signs shall be built in compliance with all applicable building and electrical codes. 
    Sign lighting. Sign lighting shall not be directed skyward and the source of light shall be effectively shielded from adjacent residential properties and streets. Sign illumination may be direct or indirect.

(Ord. No. 093-018 , 8-20-18) 
Sec. 10-10004. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 10-10004(b) and (c) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in sections 10-10004(b) and (c) of this chapter, shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 10-10004(b)(2) of this chapter. 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until ail land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and there is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
c.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
d.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
e.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
f.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the Division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in sections 10-10004(b) and (c) of this chapter. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 093-018 , 8-20-18) 
Sec. 10-10005. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the permit office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 10-10005(c) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of sections 10-10004(b) and (c) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10 or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
(3)  A fee, payable to the city, in the amount of $250.00 shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
(4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by sections 10-10004(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 10-10005(b)(7), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the District have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section of this chapter, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in sections 10-10004(b) and (c) of conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state Soil and Water Conservation Commission as a guide; or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan.

Chapter 11 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
ARTICLE A. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 10-11001. - Findings. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
(2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
(4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
(5)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
(6)  Therefore, the City of East Point has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
Sec. 10-11002. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
Sec. 10-11003. - Applicability. 
(a)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (b) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
(2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
(3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the City of East Point Office of Government Operations to be a hotspot land use; or 
(4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(b)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
(1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
(2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
(4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the city office of government operations. 
Sec. 10-11004. - Designation of article administrator. 
    The City of East Point Office of Government Operations, or its designee, is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
Sec. 10-11005. - Compatibility with other regulations. 
    The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
Sec. 10-11006. - Severability. 
    If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
Sec. 10-11007. - Stormwater design manual. 
    The city office of government operations will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 10-11101. - Findings. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
(2)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
(3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
(4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
(5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(6)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(7)  Therefore, the City of East Point adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
Sec. 10-11102. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by Federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by any person; 
(2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
(3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and 
(4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
Sec. 10-11103. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the City of East Point. 
Sec. 10-11104. - Compatibility with other regulations. 
    The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
Sec. 10-11105. - Severability.

The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.

a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
Sec. 10-12023. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
    The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
Sec. 10-12024. - Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties.

(b)  All buffer and setback areas must be recorded on the final plat of the property following plan approval. 
Sec. 10-12025. - Responsibility. 
    Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the City of East Point, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. 
Sec. 10-13026. - Inspection. 
(a)  The city office of government operations or the department of planning and zoning may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the city office of government operations and department of planning and zoning in making such inspections. The city shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area.

ARTICLE C. - CLEVELAND AVENUE OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 10-14019. - Intention. 
    The purpose of the design guidelines is to promote future development that is consistent with the Cleveland Avenue Corridor Masterplan. Generally, these design guidelines are intended to support local and regional development goals that promote alternative transportation, mix of uses, pedestrian environments, traffic calming, active living, and greenspace. 
    Additionally, providing safe and comfortable environments for people involves incorporating CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) strategies designed to provide 'eyes on the street' and to remove opportunities for crime inherent in the building or site design. 
    These guidelines are intended to be implemented as an Overlay District based on the Cleveland Avenue Corridor Overlay District Map. Overlay Districts are supplemental to the zoning district classifications established in the City of East Point's Municipal Code. All development and building permits for lots located within any overlay district shall meet all of the requirements of the base zoning district in which they are located and in addition, shall meet all of the requirements of the overlay district applicable to the particular parcel. Where there are conflicts between overlay district regulation and other regulations contained in this Code, the overlay regulation shall govern. Where the overlay district regulation is equally restrictive with other regulations in the Code, the overlay district regulation shall govern. 
    The following guidelines are organized into two major classifications: 
Sec. 10-14019.1. - Exhibit B. Cleveland Avenue Overlay District Map. 

(Ord. No. 017-11, § 3, 8-1-11) 
Sec. 10-14020. - Public framework. 
    The public framework consists of 1) Street Features; 2) Parks and Trails; 3) Gateways and is generally comprised of elements that are accessible to the public and located within the public right-of-way. 
Sec. 10-14021. - Private framework. 
    The private framework consists of six major development types: 1) single-family residential; 2) townhomes; 3) apartments (multi-family); 4) retail/mixed-use; 5) office; 6) 'big-box'. 
    All new development, or redevelopment that exceeds 50 percent of property value or 50 percent of site that is being redeveloped, within the overlay district must establish sidewalk zones, street trees, streetlights, crosswalks, street features, and street furniture according to the guidelines of the overlay. See 'Street Features: Specifications' as well as Site Diagrams within each Private Framework section for details. 
Sec. 10-14022. - Public framework. 
(a)  Street features. The street is the primary public domain and front door for private development. Careful consideration of the design of the following street features is important for enhancing the experiential quality of the corridor: Medians, Crosswalks, Bulb-outs, Wayfinding, Lighting, Traffic Circles, Street Paving, Sidewalks, Street Furniture, Public Art, Plazas, Utilities, Street Trees and Plantings. 
(b)  Parks and trail systems. Parks and trail systems promote both active and passive recreation throughout the corridor. They provide opportunities for physical activity and allow users to appreciate the natural environment. The design guidelines provide recommendations for the following: Pocket Parks, Linear Parks, Neighborhood Parks, Trail Systems. 
(c)  Gateways. Gateways provide opportunities for pedestrian amenities, such as bus shelters, and create focal points for neighborhood or district entrances. There are three types of public gateways: City Gateways, District Gateways, Neighborhood Gateways. 


Sec. 10-14023. - Definitions. 
(1)  Bulb-out - Where possible, bulb-outs allow shorter distances for pedestrians to cross major streets. Parallel parking is located behind bulb-out. 
(2)  Clear zone - Public area in the front setback that makes up the active sidewalk. 
(3)  Crosswalk - Visual and textural variation at crosswalks distinguish pedestrian crossings and enhance experience. 
(4)  Furniture zone - Area between back of curb and property line that contains street trees, street lighting, bike racks, newspaper stands, benches, and utilities. 
(5)  Planted median - Sod, groundcover, as well as ornamental trees (where median width is great enough), are planted to add visual interest, slow traffic, and provide a refuge zone for pedestrian crossing along the boulevard. 
(6)  Ramp - Handicap accessible ramps are located where crosswalks meet curbs. ADA compliant detectable warning pavers should be installed at front of ramping area. 
(7)  Street light - Street lighting adds visibility and safety and is interspersed with pedestrian scale lighting. The pattern adds to continuity of the boulevard. 
(8)  Street trees - Broad canopy trees for shade and continuity, should be trimmed to 7' clear height and kept from conflict with overhead lines. 
(9)  Supplemental zone - Generally referred to as front yard, within private property. Provides an opportunity for a public zone for dining areas or outdoor plazas. 


Sec. 10-14024. - Guidelines.

(15)  Up to 25 percent of parking may be shared in mixed-use developments upon approval of the Director of Planning and Zoning. 
(h)  Building guidelines 
Purpose. The building design guideline for retail and mixed use lays the foundation for architecturally appealing design through scale and orientation. The guideline establishes a rhythm for the buildings so they effectively communicate their use. It takes into consideration entrances, fenestration, corners, material and color, building scale and massing, awnings, outdoor dining, signage, and building numbers. 

(i)  Entrances: 
Purpose. The pedestrian entrance to the building shall portray the business identity while maintaining an inviting scale to the pedestrian. Awnings or canopies may be used for this purpose. 
Application 
(1)  All buildings shall have their principle entrance on the primary elevation and shall provide a direct connection to the sidewalk and street. 
(2)  Restaurants may have a series of doors that open to provide open air dining. 
(3)  Awnings, signs, or recessed entrances shall be integrated into the design of the building. 
(4)  Recessed entrances must not exceed 50 percent of the storefront width nor ten feet in depth. 
(5)  Service entrances or loading docks shall be designed to have minimum impact on the primary elevation. Wherever possible, they shall not be located on the primary elevation. 
(j)  Fenestration: 
Purpose. The proportions and design of building openings are integral in connecting the building to the pedestrian. The windows should also be used for the business to communicate to the public with storefront displays that provide visual interest to the pedestrian. 
Application 
(1)  All retail buildings shall have a minimum of 75 percent glass on the ground level facing public rights-of-way. Any other ground level facade that is visible from the public right-of way shall have a minimum of 50 percent. 
(2)  Windows should comprise from 25 percent to 50 percent of façades higher than ground level which are visible from public right-of-ways. 
(3)  Traditional elements around windows are permitted such as balconies, shutters and sills. 
(4)  No signage shall be adhered to the windows permanently or temporarily except the name of the business and street address. The name and street address shall take up no more than ten percent of the window to which it is adhered. 
(5)  Opaque, smoked and reflective glass should be used for accents only. 
(k)  Corners: 
Purpose. On corner lots, these corners give prominence to the intersection and add architectural interest while addressing the context. 
Application 
(1)  Project up to one additional floor higher than adjacent buildings. 
(2)  Have awnings, balconies, or signs in keeping with the design guidelines. 
(3)  Have a higher level of detail than any other corner on the building. 
(l)  Material and color: 
Purpose. Quality is an important element of construction. Substandard materials and craftsmanship are not permitted. The greatest amount architectural detail and interest shall be at the pedestrian level. The following standards are the minimum all projects should adhere to: 
Application 
(1)  High level of craftsmanship for all details and finishes. 
(2)  Color should be architecturally appropriate and not detract from adjacent properties. 
(3)  For storefront designs, attention shall be paid to the details of the window design in order to promote a connection to the pedestrian. 
(4)  Predominant exterior building materials as well as accents shall not include the following: smooth face CMU, metal siding, vinyl siding. No stucco or synthetic stucco products (EIFS, Dryvit) shall be used on the ground level. Administrative variances may be approved if materials are historically or contextually appropriate. 
(m)  Scale and massing: 
Purpose. Attention to scale and massing is important when considering both the impact of the building from the street as well as the pedestrian experience at the sidewalk. From the street, the building should appear balanced with its surrounding context of buildings and landscape. From the sidewalk, the building should consider the human scale, particularly at the ground level where pedestrians are largely impacted. 
Application 
(1)  Major horizontal elements of adjacent buildings such as awnings, cornices, etc. on the primary elevation, shall be at the same height wherever possible. 
(2)  The height of the buildings may be up to 50 feet. 
(3)  When buildings are within 100 feet of a single-family residence, the building may be up to 35 feet in height.

(5)  On the primary elevation, an architectural rhythm of 15 feet to 30 feet should be established. 
(6)  On the primary elevations of buildings over one story, the ground floor shall be architecturally distinguished from upper floors to form both an architectural base and to create an intimate scale for the pedestrian. 
(7)  Varied roof forms and cornices may be employed to express the uniqueness of each design. 
(8)  The roofs on corner lots should emphasize and enhance the corner. 
(n)  Awnings: 
Purpose. Awnings allow a business to further define their identity as well as provide shelter from the elements to pedestrians. They add design interest to the streetscape, protect displays from over exposure to the sun, and help cool the building. 
Application 
(1)  Awnings or projecting signs above seven feet may be permitted into the right-of-way so long as they do not interfere with trees, utilities, transit shelters or other street furnishings. 
(2)  Awnings, signs, or recessed entrances shall be integrated into the design of the building. 
(3)  Awnings shall have a framed opening. They should be architecturally consistent with the rest of the building. 
(4)  Adjacent awnings or awnings along the same block should be at the same height wherever possible. 
(5)  Awnings shall not interfere with pedestrian mobility. 
(6)  Awnings shall be retractable or open sided. 
(7)  Vinyl awnings are discouraged. 
(8)  Internally lit or worn awnings are not permitted. 
(o)  Outdoor dining: 
Purpose. Outdoor dining allows restaurant patrons to enjoy the open air environment and bustle of public spaces while enjoying a meal. It also permits restaurant owners to extend their dining rooms and serve a larger capacity. 
Application 
(1)  A restaurant may set itself back from the clear zone up to 20 feet to make room for outdoor dining or plazas. 
(2)  A restaurant may extend two feet into the clear zone for small tables.

(3)  Clearly visible from the sidewalk. 
(4)  Minimum of six inches in height. 
Sec. 10-14032. - Big box. 
(a)  Site guidelines 
Purpose. "Big-box" retail can be defined as large-scale retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, Kroger, Target, Circuit City, or Home Depot, which occupy more than 50,000 square feet and derive their profits from high sales volumes. They may operate as stand-alone facilities, or more commonly they are located in a "power center." Because big box developments are of a larger scale, it is important that site requirements include adequate sidewalks, minimal setbacks, landscaping, screening, and buffering to enhance the pedestrian experience. The features and spaces should enhance the building and the center as integral parts of the community fabric. Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. 


Application 
(1)  Within the development, pedestrian oriented public spaces and activities must be present. 
(2)  Two of the following, at a minimum, shall be included for each development over 50,000 SF: patio/seating areas, pedestrian plaza with seating, kiosk areas, water features, clock towers, or other amenity that adequately enhances such community and public spaces. Any such areas shall have direct access to the public sidewalk network. 
(3)  Entrances and parking lots should be configured to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. 
(4)  Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be considered as integral parts of the configuration. 
(5)  The development may have smaller buildings at the street that screen interior parking. 
(6)  Pedestrian ways should be anchored by special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, pedestrian light fixtures, bollards, planter walls, and other architectural elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces. 
(7)  If the structure is over one story, recessing upper stories is encouraged. Multiple stories and mixed-use is encouraged. 
(8)  Alternative detention/retention treatments, such as permeable paving, water features, etc. are encouraged. 
(9)  Parking reductions up to 20 percent or increases in building height up to ten feet may be granted by the Department of Planning and Zoning for mixed-uses, the use of alternative detention/retention, and/or the provision of large greenspaces, parks, or conservation areas. 
(b)  Sidewalks and accessibility: 
Purpose. Sidewalks ease pedestrian circulation to amenities and throughout the Cleveland Avenue corridor.

Purpose. Vias connect pedestrians to parking, site amenities, or other building entrances and can encourage outdoor activity on the site. 
Application 
(1)  Be visually connected to the buildings through store front windows and or entrances or restaurant seating. 
(2)  May allow enough room for open air restaurant seating. 
(3)  Use specially designed elements including paving, lighting, landscape and street furniture. 
(e)  Landscaping: 
Purpose. Landscaping enhances the experiential quality of the corridor by providing a balance of natural greenscape against building and hardscape elements. In addition, landscape can be used to define and improve the aesthetics of boundaries, gateways, entrances, and special site features. 
Application 
(1)  Twenty-five percent of site must be covered with greenscape or special permeable paving materials; however, impervious public plazas may count towards five percent of this requirement. Up to 30 percent of the greenspace requirement may be comprised of approved permeable paving materials. 
(2)  Landscape should be designed so that 80 percent coverage occurs after five years. 
(3)  Landscape design should include a variety of deciduous, evergreen trees, shrubs and flowering plant species well suited to the local climate. 
(4)  Where feasible, existing healthy trees on the site of greater than 6" DBH should be incorporated into the required landscaping of the site. 
(f)  Screening and buffering: 
Purpose. Screening and buffering maintains the attractiveness of the building while providing for its functionality. 
Application 
(1)  A 50 foot landscaped area must buffer buildings or parking adjacent to residential zones; areas of parking must also be screened with a privacy wall or fence (minimum six feet height) when adjacent to a residential use. 
(2)  Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or compaction, loading, or other such uses shall not be visible from public or private rights-of-way and shall not be located within 20 feet of any public street, public, sidewalk or internal pedestrian walkways.

(7)  Light spillage onto adjacent residential properties shall be reduced by a cut-off luminaire with a maximum of 90 degrees illumination. 
(8)  There shall be a continuous landscape buffer with a minimum of eight feet between parking areas and the street. An eight-foot buffer shall be established where parking abuts other property lines. 
(9)  Parking lots with 50 or more spaces shall be divided into separate areas with minimum ten feet landscape strip. Walkways may cut through the landscaping. 
(10)  One driveway for each development is permitted. Properties with more than one front yard which may have two driveways. 
(11)  One large canopy tree and a planted median should be planted for every seven parking spaces, within interior and perimeter planting areas. 
(12)  A minimum of seven percent of the parking lot must be landscaped. 
(14)  One two foot by six-foot minimum bicycle parking space per 20 parking spaces. 
(h)  Building guidelines 
Purpose. Avoid monotonous expanses of large-scale development by providing guidelines that adhere to human scale. 
    No single one story building or series of interior connected buildings shall contain more than 100,000 sf. No two story building or series of interior connected buildings shall contain more than 150,000 sf. 

(i)  Entrances: 
Purpose. The pedestrian entrance to the building shall portray the business identity while maintaining an inviting scale to the pedestrian. Multiple building entrances reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access from public sidewalks, and provide convenience. Multiple entrances also mitigate the effect of the unbroken walls and neglected areas that often characterize building façades that face bordering land uses. Awnings or canopies may be used for this purpose. 
Application 
(1)  All sides of a principal building that directly face an abutting public or private right of way shall feature at least one customer entrance. 
(2)  Where a principal building directly faces more than two abutting public or private rights-of-way, this requirement shall apply only to two sides of the building, including the side of the building facing the primary street, and another side of the building facing a secondary street. 
(3)  Where additional stores will be located in the principal building, each such store shall have at least one exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above requirements. 
(4)  Each principal building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring: canopies, porticos, overhangs, recesses/projections, arcades, raised corniced parapets over the door, peaked roof forms, arches. 
(j)  Fenestration: 
Purpose. The proportions and design of building openings are integral in connecting the building to the pedestrian. The windows should also be used for the business to communicate to the public with storefront displays that provide visual interest to the pedestrian. 
Application 
(1)  All retail buildings shall have a minimum of 75 percent glass on the ground level facing public rights-of-way. Any other ground level facade that is visible from the public right-of way shall have a minimum of 50 percent. 
(2)  Windows should comprise from 25 percent to 50 percent of façades higher than ground level which are visible from public rights-of-way. 
(3)  Traditional elements around windows are permitted such as balconies, shutters and sills. 
(4)  No signage shall be adhered to the windows permanently or temporarily except the name of the business and street address. 
(5)  The name and street address shall take up no more than ten percent of the window to which it is adhered. 
(6)  Opaque, smoked and reflective glass should be used for accents only. 
(k)  Materials and colors: 
Purpose. Quality is an important element of construction. Substandard materials and craftsmanship are not permitted. The greatest amount architectural detail and interest shall be at the pedestrian level. 
Application 
(1)  High level of craftsmanship for all details and finishes. 
(2)  Color should be architecturally appropriate and not detract from adjacent properties. 
(3)  For storefront designs, attention shall be paid to the details of the window design in order to promote a connection to the pedestrian. 
(4)  Predominant exterior building materials as well as accents shall not include the following: smooth face CMU, metal siding, vinyl siding. No stucco shall be used on the ground level. Administrative variances may be approved if materials are historically or contextually appropriate. 
(l)  Scale and massing: 
Purpose. Attention to scale and massing is important when considering both the impact of the building from the street as well as the pedestrian experience at the sidewalk. Façades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual interest that will be consistent with the community's identity, character, and scale. The resulting scale will ensure a greater likelihood of reuse of structure by subsequent tenants. 
Application 
(1)  No minimum width is required for outparcels provided that all applicable Code requirements can be met on the outparcel. 
(2)  Developments with façade over 100 feet in linear length shall incorporate wall projections or recesses a minimum of three-foot depth and a minimum of 20 contiguous feet within each 100 feet of facade length and shall extend over 20 percent of the façade. 
(3)  Developments shall use features such as arcades, display windows, entry areas, and awnings along at least 60 percent of the façade. 
(4)  When buildings are within 100 feet of a single-family residence, the building may be up to 35 feet in height. 
(5)  Rooflines shall be varied with a change in height every 100 linear feet in the building length. Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs, hip roofs, or dormers shall be used to conceal flat roofs and roof top equipment from public view. 
(6)  Building façades shall include a repeating patterns of the following at intervals of no more than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically: color change; texture change; material module change; or expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib. 
(m)  Secondary retail/mixed-use: 
Purpose. The presence of smaller retail stores or residential above ground level retail gives a center a "friendlier" appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and expanding the range of the site's activities. Windows and window displays of such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior façades. The standards presented in this section are directed toward those situations where additional, smaller stores, with separate, exterior customer entrances are located in the principal buildings or development site. Additionally, residential uses can be incorporated into the development above smaller ground level retail uses. 
Application. Where principal buildings contain additional, separately owned stores, which occupy less than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances: 
(1)  The street level façade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than 60 percent of the horizontal length of the building façade of such additional stores. 
(2)  Windows shall be recessed and should include visually prominent sills, shutters, or other such forms of framing. 
(3)  Windows should comprise from 25 percent to 50 percent of façades higher than ground level which are visible from public rights-of-way. 
(4)  All retail buildings shall have a minimum of 75 percent glass on the ground level. 
(5)  Traditional elements around windows are permitted such as balconies, shutters and sills. 
(6)  No signage shall be adhered to the windows permanently or temporarily except the name of the business and street address. The name and street address shall take up no more than ten percent of the window to which it is adhered. 
(7)  Opaque, smoked and reflective glass should be used for accents only. 
(n)  Building numbers: 
Application 
(1)  Above the primary elevation entrance. 
(2)  Clearly visible from the sidewalk. 
(3)  Minimum of six inches in height. 
(4)  Creativity in the design of the number is encouraged.
