PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Trussville, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council through Ordinance No. 2007-041-ADM, adopted December 27, 2007. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 
CDB:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.

Sec. 18-33. - License term; application of payment, administration. 
    As a part of the application process, the municipal designee is authorized to require current photo identification of the applicant, along with any other documentation necessary to determine the identity and/or the citizenship or lawful status in the United States of any sole proprietor or partner, and may further require any incorporation documents, federal tax identification number, Alabama sales tax number, and to require a copy of any required state certification, certificate, or permit prerequisite to procuring certain types of licenses. Any expired identification document or any expired, suspended, or revoked certification, certificate or permit will not be honored for business licensing purposes. 
    The license term for a business license and policy for the application of payment are as follows: 
(a)  Payment in full. All license amounts due shall be due and payable in full at one time when the license is taken or renewed. 
(b)  Payment of license by check. Wherever a license or license receipt shall be issued in return for any check, the same shall not be valid or of any force or effect unless such check shall be duly paid upon presentation to the drawee. 
(c)  Full year. Every person who commences business before the first day of July shall be subject to and shall pay the full annual license for such business. 
(d)  Half year. Every person who commences business on or after July 1, shall be subject to and shall pay one-half the annual license for such business in full for that calendar year. 
(e)  Daily and weekly. Every person who commences business for one day or one week shall pay an amount as set out herein for such business in full before engaging in business. Daily and weekly licenses are not prorated at any time during the year. 
(f)  Issuance fee. For each license issued, there shall be an issuance fee in the amount established, and adjusted quinquennially (every five years) by the Alabama Department of Revenue, and the issuance fee shall be collected in the same manner as the license tax. 
(g)  Annual renewal. Except as provided in subsections (i) or (ii), the business license shall be renewed annually on or before the thirty-first day of January each year. 
(i)  If the due date for payment of any business license falls on a weekend or a holiday recognized by the municipality from time to time, the due date shall automatically be extended until the next business day. 
(ii)  Insurance company annual license renewals shall be renewed in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-122 which states that each year, each insurance company shall furnish the municipality a statement in writing duly certified showing the full and true amount of gross premiums received during the preceding year and shall accompany such statement with the amount of license tax due according to the licensing schedule. Failure to furnish such statement or to pay such sum shall subject the company and its agents to those penalties as prescribed for doing business without a license as provided for in the municipal Code. Said insurance licenses are due and payable within 60 days of the due date. 
(iii)  On or before December 31 of each year, a renewal reminder shall be mailed to each licensee that purchased a business license during the current year. Said renewal notice shall be mailed via regular U.S. mail to the licensee's last known address of record with the municipality. Licensees are required to furnish the municipality any address changes for their business prior to December 1 in order for them to receive their notice. 
(h)  Payments to be applied to delinquencies first. No license will be renewed to any person, firm, entity or corporation if any city taxes or fees (sales or use tax, liquor, tobacco, wine, lodging, rental, garbage, or other city tax or fee) are delinquent. Business license renewal payments received by the municipality shall be applied to the current renewal only when any and all other debts the licensee owes to the municipality are first paid in full. No business license shall be issued if the payment received does not meet said prior obligations and the current renewal amount in full. Any payment received shall first be applied to the outstanding debt. Failure to pay such sums shall subject the licensee and its agents to those penalties as prescribed for doing business without a license provided for in the municipal Code. 
(i)  Gross receipts threshold. The gross receipts threshold for licensing multiple lines of business conducted as one business unit shall be ten percent as permitted by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-95(b). 
(j)  Interest. Interest shall be assessed on business license tax delinquencies at the rate of one percent per month simple interest. 
(k)  First year license or license after hiatus. 
(i)  If the business or individual is procuring its first business license with the City of Trussville or is procuring a City of Trussville business license after a hiatus, then the initial year's total gross receipts of the business are to be estimated. Prior to the issuance of the next succeeding year's license, the amount previously estimated will be compared to the verified total gross receipts of the preceding year's operation, and the preceding year's license payment shall be adjusted to the actual receipts. Any additional amount owed on the first year's license shall be paid with no penalty if paid by the established time for license renewal, or any overpayment amount will be credited to the next year's license. 
(ii)  The gross receipts of a business for the year next succeeding the first license year or first license year after hiatus, shall be the actual results of operations of said business, provided, however, that if said business did not operate for an entire 12-month period during the preceding license year, then the license tax in the succeeding license year shall be based upon an amount of annualized receipts. Such annualized receipts shall be determined by using an amount that bears the same relationship to the actual amount of receipts during the preceding year as the entire year (12 months) bears to the number of months or fractional months that the business was operated during its preceding calendar year of operation in the city. 
(l)  Record keeping. The clerk or designee shall keep a list of all the persons doing business in the city and subject to a license, including the business classification(s) and the amounts collected. Said records shall be preserved as required to facilitate future license administration. 
(m)  Affidavit of exemption. Any person claiming exemption from the license requirement must provide the clerk with an affidavit containing satisfactory evidence that they meet the statutory conditions which entitle them to such exemption. The affidavit must be filed with the clerk before the granting of such exemption. 
(n)  Farm products. The Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-105, exempts farmers from payment of municipal license for the sale of delivery of products which they have grown themselves. Exemption does not apply for products which they have purchased for resale. 
(o)  Exclusions. No provisions of this article shall be construed as to tax interstate commerce, the United States Government, or any state, county, or municipal business.

To establish a bona fide branch office, the taxpayer must demonstrate proof of all following criteria: 
(1)  The taxpayer must demonstrate the continuing existence of an actual facility located outside the city limits in which its principal business office is located, such as a retail store, outlet, business office, showroom, or warehouse, to which employees and/or independent contractors are assigned or located during regular normal working hours.

(6)  The taxpayer must supply proof that all applicable business licenses with respect to the branch office or offices have been issued.

(1)  Other than deliveries, the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the municipality or the police jurisdiction; 
(2)  The taxpayer conducts no other business in the municipality or the police jurisdiction other than delivering merchandise and performing the requisite set-up and installation of said merchandise;

(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the municipality to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the $75,000.00 limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the taxing jurisdiction using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite set-up or installation of all merchandise so delivered exceeding $75,000.00 during the license year will be licensed under the provisions of a retailer or a wholesaler. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year.

(f)  A taxpayer that otherwise meets the criteria for the purchase of a delivery license is not required to purchase a delivery license or a regular business license if (i) the taxpayer's gross receipts that are derived from within the municipality or its police jurisdiction do not exceed $10,000.00; and (ii) the tax payer has no other physical presence within the municipality during the year.

Provided that a mere change in the name or ownership of a taxpayer that is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other form of legal entity now or hereafter recognized by the laws of Alabama shall not constitute a transfer for purposes of this chapter, unless (1) the change requires the taxpayer to obtain a new federal employer identification number or department of revenue taxpayer identification number or (2), in the discretion of the municipality, the subject license is one for the sale of alcoholic beverages. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a municipality from requiring a new business license application and approval for an alcoholic beverage license. In no instance shall any license be transferred from one type of business to another type of business.

ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER DETENTION[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I §§ 1, 2, adopted Sept. 28, 2004, amended art. V in its entirety and enacted similar provisions as set out herein. The former art. V derived from Ord. No. 98-007 E&I, §§ 1, 2, adopted Feb. 10, 1998. 

Sec. 38-101. - General. 
(a)  [Detention devices.] Developments which produce an increase in the amount of stormwater runoff may be required to construct stormwater detention ponds or other approved types of detention devices. 
(b)  [Plans.] When required, the developer shall submit detailed engineering plans to the director of engineering and inspections including historical runoff, developed runoff, detention pond details, method of discharge, and other information as required for review. The developer shall also include a description of the method of maintenance for the detention pond after the development is completed. 
(c)  Minimum requirements for stormwater detention and design criteria. Among the consequences of growth and development, two are of great relevance to stormwater management: (i) increased runoff created by the change of the nature and properties of the surface of the ground and (ii) velocity of discharge of this increased runoff. 
The natural condition of the land before development is in relative balance with the natural capacity of the receiving streams. The undeveloped conditions provide greater permeability and longer time of concentration. By modification of the surface from the irregular, pervious and with vegetation, the areas more changed to more impervious, more effectively drained and in most cases denuded of vegetation. It is the intent of this section to alert the developers to possible harmful effects from any land development project on properties downstream and to provide a guideline for evaluation and control of the elements related to stormwater which affect the welfare and safety of the citizens of the city. 
In order to provide some control of these possible harmful elements of development and reduce economic losses due to erosion and flooding, the criteria of differential runoff and stormwater detention are hereby established. 
The terms of this design criterion shall become effective for all projects under direct jurisdiction of the director of engineering and inspections. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-102. - Jurisdiction. 
    All projects which fall under the inspection, permitting, or plan review jurisdiction of the director of engineering and inspections on items related to stormwater management, sanitary sewers and site development within the city limits and within the extraterritorial planning jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-103. - Liability. 
    The design criteria establish minimum elements of design, which must be implemented with good engineering and good workmanship. Use of the information contained herein for placement of any structure or use of land shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the city, its offices, or employees of the practicability, adequacy or safety and shall not create liability upon or cause action against any such public body, office or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-104. - Engineer's seal. 
    All plans and specifications submitted for review and/or approval shall be prepared by, or under the direct supervision of, a registered profession engineer, licensed in the state, and shall meet the minimum standards and requirements of the director of engineering and inspections and other applicable authorities. Each of the plans, profiles and special drawing sheets for a project shall bear a legible stamp of the professional engineer in charge. If the name or license number is not clear the signature and number shall be added. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-105. - Predesign conference. 
    The developer and the consulting engineer are encouraged to contact the director of engineering and inspections for a predesign conference at the conceptual stage of a project. Such conference would be mutually beneficial to outline the complexity and scope of design, applicability of criteria, and elimination of possible items of conflict during the review process. 
    Subsequent conferences during the preparation of plans may be arranged by the consulting engineer or the developer to obtain preliminary, informal decisions on items in need of clarification. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-106. - Letter of transmittal. 
    In order to facilitate review of plans, all projects shall be submitted with a letter of transmittal which shall include the name of the project, name and address of the owner or developer, name, address and telephone number of the engineer and clarification as to the purpose of submittal.

(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-107. - Differential runoff. 
    The difference in rate and volume of stormwater runoff from a parcel or project in its undeveloped natural condition and its developed condition is known as the differential runoff. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-108. - Developments affected. 
    Detention requirements are directly related to permitted land use in zoning ordinance of the city and within the extraterritorial planning jurisdiction. The permitted densities and minimum lot areas are important factors in the anticipated runoff. Projects of small acreage may be required to provide detention if conditions in the receiving system are inadequate, or harmful effects can be anticipated if detention is not implemented. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-109. - Phasing and platting. 
    The effective acreage for a project is not limited to a fractional part of the total concept; rather, if a project is developed in phases or small plats, the total acreage of the conceptual project will be considered. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-110. - Method of evaluation. 
    Differential runoff evaluation consists of determination of rated [rates] of runoff before and after development, determination of required volume of detention and verification of adequacy of discharge and control structures. Design should be based on a type III, 100-year, 24-hour storm or greater for fully developed land use in accordance with the comprehensive zoning plan of the city. This shall be based on sound engineering criteria and computations shall be submitted to the director of engineering and inspections for review. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-111. - Method of detention. 
    The following conditions and limitations should be observed in selection and use of method of detention. 
(1)  General location. Detention facilities shall be located within the parcel limits of the project under consideration. 
No detention or ponding will be permitted within public road rights-of-way.

Maximum side slopes for grassed reservoirs shall not exceed one foot vertical for two feet horizontal unless adequate measures are included to provide elevation be closer than 30 feet horizontally from any building and less than two feet vertically below the lowest sill elevation. The entire reservoir area shall be seeded, fertilized and mulched, sodded or paved prior to release of surety if required by the director of engineering and inspections. 
    Any area susceptible to, or designed as, overflow by higher design intensity rainfall (100-year frequency) shall be sodded or paved. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-119. - Open channels. 
    Normally permitted open channels may be used as detention areas provided that the limits of the maximum ponding elevation are not closer than 30 feet horizontally from any buildings, and less than two feet below the lowest sill elevation of any building. No ponding will be permitted within public road rights-of-way. Maximum depth of detention in open channels shall be four feet. Minimum flowline grade shall be 0.5 percent for grassed untreated bottoms or 0.2 percent for paved channels. 
    For trapezoidal sections the maximum side slopes of the detention area of the channel shall not exceed one foot vertical for two feet horizontal. For design of other typical channel sections the features of safety, stability and ease of maintenance shall be observed. 
    The entire reservoir area of the open channel shall be seeded, fertilized and mulched, sodded, paved, or lined prior to release of escrows. 
    The hydraulic elevations resulting from channel detention shall not adversely affect adjoining properties. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-120. - Permanent lakes. 
    Permanent lakes with fluctuating volume controls may be used as detention areas provided that the limits of maximum ponding elevations are no closer than 30 feet horizontally from any building and less than two feet below the lowest sill elevation of any building. 
    Maximum side slopes for the fluctuating area of permanent lakes shall be one foot vertical to two feet horizontal unless proper provisions are included for safety, stability and ease of maintenance. 
    Maximum fluctuation from permanent pool elevation to maximum ponding elevation shall be three feet. 
    Special consideration is suggested to safety and accessibility to small children in the design of permanent lakes in residential areas. 
    Viability of the permanent impoundment shall be considered. An acceptable guideline is to make the area of the permanent pool no greater than one-tenth the size of the tributary drainage area. It is suggested that the minimum depth of 25 percent of the permanent pool area be no less than eight feet. Allowance for silting under denuded soil conditions (during construction) for a period no less than one year is also recommended. 
    The entire fluctuating area of the permanent reservoir shall be seeded, fertilized and mulched, sodded or paved prior to release of surety if required by the director of engineering and inspections. Any area susceptible to or designed as overflow by higher design intensity rainfall (25-year frequency) shall be sodded or paved. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-121. - Parking lots. 
    Detention is permitted in parking lots to maximum depth of eight inches. In no case should the maximum limits of ponding be designed closer than ten feet from a building unless water proofing of the building and pedestrian accessibility are properly documented. 
    The minimum freeboard from the maximum ponding elevation to the lowest sill elevation shall be one foot. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-122. - Other methods. 
    Other methods of detention such as seepage pits, French drains, etc., are discouraged. If other methods are proposed, proper documentation of soils data, percolation, geological features, etc. will be needed for review and consideration. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-123. - Verification of adequacy. 
    The engineer always performs analysis of all elements of design. The following outline is provided to ascertain that certain critical elements of design are in workable compliance to the aims of design: 
(a)  Volume of retention for the total project; 
(b)  Tributary (Q) peak runoff to basin;

(d)  Ratios of inflow to outflow rates; 
(e)  Sizing of the overflow facilities; 
(f)  Stability of dikes; 
(g)  Safety features; 
(h)  Maintenance features. 
    For projects up to 200 acres, routing calculations shall be submitted in legible tabulated form. Proof of adequacy of volume of retention and sizing computations for low-flow structures shall also be submitted. Features of stability and safety may also need to be documented if the scope of the project requires special attention in this area of design. 
    Projects over 200 acres in area shall provide documented verification of adequacy according to scope and complexity of design. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-124. - Control structures. 
    Detention facilities shall be provided with obvious and effective control structures. Plan view and sections of the structure with adequate detail shall be included in plans. 
    Sizing the low-flow pipe shall be by inlet control or hydraulic gradient requirements. 
    Low-flow pipes shall not be smaller than eight inches in diameter to minimize maintenance and operating problems, except in parking lot and roof retention where minimum size of opening shall be designed specifically for each condition. The low-flow pipe shall be provided with a bar-screen on a minimum two to one slope to reduce blockage by debris. 
    The overflow opening or spillway shall be designed to accept the total peak runoff of the improved tributary area. 
    Proper engineering judgment shall be exercised in analysis of secondary routing of discharge of greater intensity than the basic design storm in order to avoid economic losses or damage downstream. Review with 100-year frequency. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-125. - Discharge systems. 
    Sizing of the system below the control structure shall be for the total improved peak runoff tributary to the structure with no allowance for detention. 
    When existing downstream pipe sizing outside the developer's control jurisdiction is inadequate, an evaluation for undersizing of pipes will be undertaken by the director of engineering and inspections upon receipt of written request from the engineer specifying the run of runs wished to undersize. 
    Request for undersizing shall be accompanied by plans and profiles of the entire undersized system downstream if less than 500 feet in length or a minimum of 500 feet. 
    When hydraulic gradients of the proposed undersized system affect the performance or capacity of structures maintained by the city, no undersizing will be allowed. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-126. - Easements. 
    Two types of easements shall be provided in plans for detention facilities. 
(a)  Maintenance easement. All detention reservoirs with the exception of parking lot and roof detention shall be enclosed by a maintenance easement for public use. The limits of the easement shall extend ten feet beyond the maximum anticipated ponding area. 
(b)  Drainage easement. A minimum 15-foot-wide drainage easement shall be provided within the reservoir area, connecting the tributary pipes and the discharge system, along the most possible routing of a piping system for possible future elimination of detention. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-127. - Maintenance. 
    Detention facilities, when mandatory, are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer installation and/or grading. Since these facilities are intended to control increased runoff they must be partially or fully operational soon after the clearing of the vegetation. Silt and debris connected with early construction shall be removed periodically from the detention area and control structure in order to maintain close to full storage capacity. 
    The responsibility of maintenance of the detention facilities in subdivision projects, if such have been required, shall remain with the developer until such time as applicable escrows are released. Upon release of escrows, the maintenance responsibility shall be vested in the trustees of the subdivision, by virtue of the trust indenture. The indenture of trust shall clearly indicate resident responsibility for maintenance in cases of projects without common ground. 
(Ord. No. 2004-082-E&I, § 1, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 38-128. - Appeals.

(b)  Time limit. Any person (1) whose application for a stormwater detention permit has been denied, suspended or revoked, or (2) whose request for the use of an alternate material or method of construction has been refused by the director of engineering and inspections, or (3) who may consider that the provisions of this Code do not cover the point raised or that any particular provision would cause a manifest injury or damage to be done, may appeal to the commission by serving written notice on the director or engineering and inspections. Such notice shall be at once transmitted to the commission which shall arrange for a hearing on the issue raised. If the appellant is requesting to use alternate materials or types of construction, the appellant shall pay all expenses for necessary tests made of ordered by the board. 
Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed within 30 days after a decision is rendered by the director of engineering and inspections. Such written notice shall be accompanied with the sum of $50.00 payable to the city. If the appeal is denied such fee shall be retained by the city, otherwise the fee shall be returned to the appellant. 
In the case of stormwater detention which in the opinion of the director of engineering and inspections is unsafe or dangerous, the director of engineering and inspections may, in his order, limit the time for such appeal to a shorter period. Appeals hereunder shall be on forms provided by the director of engineering and inspections. 
(c)  Variations and modifications. The board when so appealed to and after a hearing may vary the application of any provision of this Code to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice, and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this Code or public interest, or when, in its opinion the interpretation of the director of engineering and inspections should be modified or reversed. 
A decision of the commission to vary the application of any provisions of this Code or to modify an order of the director of engineering and inspections shall specify in what manner such variation or modification is made, the conditions upon which it is made, and the reasons therefor. 
(d)  Decisions. Every decision of the board shall be final, subject, however, to such remedy as any aggrieved party might have at law or in equity. It shall be in writing and shall indicate the vote upon the decision. Every decision shall be promptly filed in the office of the director of engineering and inspections and shall be open to public inspection; a certified copy shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the appellant. 
The board shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. 
If a decision of the board reverses or modifies a refusal, order, or disallowance of the director of engineering and inspections, or varies the application of any provisions of this Code, the director of engineering and Inspections shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision.

    Berm: A planted elevated ground area (a mound) generally designed to restrict view and to deflect or absorb noise. Berms with ground cover(s) that require mowing shall have slopes not exceeding one foot of rise per three feet of run. No slope shall exceed 50 percent. 
    Buffer: A combination of physical space and vertical elements, such as plants, berms, fences, or walls, the purpose of which is to separate and screen incompatible land uses from each other. 
    Caliper: The caliper of a tree is the diameter measurement of the trunk at a specified distance above ground level. This measurement is to comply with AAN (American Association of Nurserymen) standards or, when this standard is not known, existing trees will be measured at four and one-half feet above ground level, and new, small, or multistem trees at six inches above ground level. 
    Deciduous plants: Plants with foliage that is shed annually. 
    Evergreen plants: Plants that remain green and retain their foliage yearround. 
    Ground covers: Ground covers include plant materials which reach a maximum height of 18 inches and may be used in lieu of grass in areas in which slopes present difficulty in mowing. Ground covers must present a finished appearance at completion of installation. 
    Island: A landscaping feature or median surrounded on all sides by parking or vehicular areas. 
    Landscape: Plant materials, topography, and other natural physical elements combined in relation to one another and to man-made structures. 
    Natural vegetation: Existing trees and shrubs left in a natural state, except that underbrush may be cleared and plantings added. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing removal of junk, debris, dead trees or limbs, abandoned structures, fences and the like from the natural vegetation areas. This vegetation shall be of sufficient number, size, and species that accomplish the same general function as new plantings. 
    Ornamental tree: A deciduous tree planted primarily for its ornamental value or for screening purposes; tends to be smaller at maturity than a street tree. 
    Parking lot: Vehicular surface areas used for parking vehicles, to include parking spaces, and traffic aisles. 
    Peninsula: An interior landscaping feature attached on one side to perimeter planting, median planting, building site, etc., and surrounded on all other sides by parking or vehicular areas. 
    Plant materials: Trees, shrubs, vines, ground covers, grass, perennials, annuals, and bulbs. 
    Screen: A method of reducing the impact of noise and unsightly visual intrusions with less offensive or more harmonious elements, such as plants, berms, fences, walls, or any appropriate combination thereof. 
    Shrub: A woody plant, smaller than a tree, consisting of several small stems from the ground or small branches near the ground; may be deciduous or evergreen. 
    Sight triangle: A triangular area established at the intersection of two streets or a street and a driveway where clear sight distance is maintained for motorists. In the case of two intersecting streets, the sight triangle is formed by connecting two legs extending 75 feet from the center of an intersection along the center lint of the street rights-of-way. In the case of a driveway (or other channel for vehicle entrance or exit) intersecting a street, each leg of the triangle shall be 15 feet along the street right-of-way and driveway edge. Roads with multiple lanes may require additional sight distance. This shall be determined by the engineering and inspections department. Landscape materials within this sight triangle shall not have a mature height greater than 36 inches, and low-hanging limbs of trees planted adjacent to the sight triangle whose limbs encroach into this area shall be trimmed to a minimum height of six feet above ground level. 
    Specimen tree: A particularly impressive or unusual example of a species due to its size, shade, age, or any other trait that epitomizes the character or the species. 
    Street tree: It should be a long lived tree (25 plus years) and easy to maintain. It should be planted no more than 35 feet from the center of the street when the right-of-way is 50 feet, but not on the right-of-way without approval of the city when the right-of-way is wider than 50 feet. 
    Streetscape: The scene as may be observed along a public street or way composed of natural and man-made components, including buildings, paving, planting, street hardware, and miscellaneous structures. 
    Subdivision development: For the purpose of this article, a subdivision or development shall mean any new approval of a residential, commercial, or industrial subdivision or development project regardless of the number of lots; or any new sector added to an existing subdivision or development; or any new commercial or industrial development or redevelopment undertaken upon a tract of land. 
    Tree: A large, woody plant having one or several self-supporting stems or trunks and numerous branches. May be classified as deciduous or evergreen. 
(Ord. No. 99-019-ADM, § 2, 8-24-99) 
Sec. 38-277. - Tree conservation. 
    All subdivisions and land developers are encouraged to preserve as many healthy trees and shrubs on the site as possible. When practical, special care is encouraged to preserve trees that are particularly impressive and epitomize the character of the species, as their size and beauty require many years to accomplish and their aesthetic quality cannot easily be replaced. 
    Techniques such as retaining trees in areas of severe terrain, flood areas, and along rear property lines, drainage ways, detention basins, and the periphery of the project can be accomplished with minimal impact to the development. Ideally, where site run-off requires detention areas, these areas should be designed as "park type" amenities to the development.

Secs. 38-278-38-284. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 38-285. - Street trees. 
    The preservation of existing trees in close proximity of the rights-of-way is encouraged, but in their absence or when impractical, trees selected from an approved list compiled by the Trussville Tree Commission shall be planted as follows: 
(a)  General requirements: 
1.  A street tree plan shall be submitted for any new subdivision or land development, including commercial and industrial single-tract development, as part of: 
a.  The design and construction of new streets; 
b.  The development of land along existing streets or highways abutting or lying within the subdivision or land development or along a single commercial or industrial tract; or 
c.  Along access entrances to residential subdivisions or land developments or other residential common areas, including but not limited to, access entrances to residential subdivisions. 
2.  Subdivision or land development shall include any new subdivision, any addition to any existing subdivision, or the development of any individual residential, commercial or industrial tract. 
3.  Street trees shall be planted outside the right-of-way, either within lots or within common open areas, unless otherwise approved by the tree commission, city landscape supervisor, or designated city representative. Consideration should be given in the species selection and planting location to minimize utility interruption caused by tree limbs growing through or falling on overhead utility lines and also to minimize damage to the city's infrastructure, such as streets, gutters, sidewalks, and underground utilities caused by tree roots. 
4.  At the intersections of roadways or vehicular access points, no plant material with a mature height greater than 36 inches shall be planted within the sight triangle, and low-hanging limbs of trees planted adjacent to the sight triangle whose limbs encroach into this area shall be trimmed to a minimum height of six feet above ground level. 
5.  The property owner or his agent shall be responsible for pruning and other maintenance of the street trees. 
6.  The planting of street trees in residential common areas shall be completed and inspected by the tree commission or the city landscape supervisor or other city designee prior to acceptance of the streets for city maintenance. The planting of street trees on individual lots shall be completed and inspected by the tree commission or the city landscape supervisor or other city designee prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. This shall not include certificates of occupancy issued after additions are made to existing residences or after repairs are made to an existing residence due to fire or other damage. 
7.  The plant specifications for new street trees were chosen and approved by the tree commission to provide for trees with a long life span. The use of other types of trees within the landscape is encouraged in other areas of the yard. A list of recommended street trees are contained on the Trussville Tree Commission list of approved trees (see attached list). This list may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the commission. An alternate plan may be submitted for approval by the tree commission or by the city landscape supervisor or other city designee. 
(b)  Efforts are encouraged to incorporate healthy existing trees in the street-tree requirement as these trees are an amenity requiring many years to replace. Any healthy existing tree located within ten feet of the right-of-way line, or when there is no defined or dedicated right-of-way, located between 25 to 35 feet of the center line of the roadway should be considered for incorporation into the street tree plan. Grading and construction should avoid disturbance of trees to be retained to foster their survival. 
(c)  New street trees shall be planted within ten feet of the right-of-way line of the street, or when there is no defined or dedicated right-of-way, trees shall be planted between 25 to 35 feet of the center line of the roadway. 
(d)  Lots with road frontage of less than 80 feet would require one large tree or two small trees. Two large trees or four small trees or a combination thereof would be required when there is 80 feet or more of road frontage but less than 120 feet, etc. There shall be a minimum of one tree for every 40 feet of road right-of-way frontage along any adjoining roadway, not to be construed as uniform spacing of trees on 40-foot centers. 
(e)  Calipers for larger trees as designated on the approved tree commission list shall be one and one-half inches or larger, and for small trees shall be one-inch caliper or larger. Staking is required for all trees above one-inch caliper for a minimum of one year and not to exceed two years. (See "Trussville's Trees," attached to Ordinance No. 99-019-ADM.) 
(f)  An administrative review may be requested for approval of alternate plans or to arbitrate disputes. The review committee will include two members of the planning and zoning board and two members of the tree commission. If there is a tie vote on the plan, the mayor or will become a voting member to break the tie. 
(Ord. No. 99-019-ADM, § 4, 8-24-99) 
Sec. 38-286. - Trees and landscape requirements in parking lots. 
    This section is enacted to mitigate the visual blight associated with vast expanses of unbroken pavement in parking lots through the use of plants and trees to add color, shade and variety. 
(a)  These regulations shall apply to all parking lots containing 20 spaces or more; however, landscaping is encouraged in all parking lots, including those with fewer than 20 spaces. 
(b)  These regulations establish requirements for three parking lot areas as follows: 
1.  Street frontage landscaping shall be in accordance with one of the following: 
a.  A minimum of one tree and ten shrubs for every 40 feet of right-of-way frontage planted within ten feet of the right-of-way edge, excluding driveway openings, and provided that no plant material with a mature height of greater than 36 inches shall be planted within the sight triangle, and low hanging limbs of trees planted adjacent to the sight triangle whose limbs encroach into this area shall be trimmed to a minimum height of six feet above ground level. Existing mature trees lying within this area may be incorporated into the landscape requirement. This should not be construed to mean trees should be planted on 40-foot centers, nor that shrubs should be planted on four-foot centers. (Figure 1 attached to Ordinance No. 99-019-ADM, section 4.) 
b.  A berm that is at least two and one-half feet higher than the finished elevation of the parking lot placed at or near the right-of-way line may be constructed provided that the berm shall sloped back from the driveway in such a manner as to provide a clear view within the sight triangle for ingress and egress, taking into account the mature height of any plant material installed on the slope. The berm shall have a minimum of one tree and five shrubs for every 40 feet of right-of-way frontage, excluding driveway openings, and provided that no plant material with a mature height of greater than 36 inches shall be planted within the sight triangle and low hanging limbs of trees planted adjacent to the sight triangle whose limbs encroach into this area shall be trimmed to a minimum height of six feet above ground level. This should not be construed to mean trees should be planted on 40-foot centers, nor shrubs to be planted on eight-foot centers. Berms with ground cover(s) that require mowing shall have slopes not to exceed one foot of rise per three feet of run. No slope shall exceed 50 percent. (Figure 2 attached to Ordinance No. 99-019-ADM, section 4.) 
c.  A three-foot strip at or near road grade with a six-foot strip having a minimum three-foot grade drop to the parking lot shall have a minimum of one tree and five shrubs for every 40 feet of right-of-way frontage, excluding driveway openings, and provided that the ground shall be sloped back from the driveway in such a manner as to provide a clear view within the sight triangle for ingress and egress, taking into account the mature height of any plant material installed on the slope. No plant material with a mature height of greater than 36 inches shall be planted within the sight triangle, and low hanging limbs of trees planted adjacent to the sight triangle whose limbs encroach into this area shall be trimmed to a minimum height of six feet above ground level. This should not be construed to mean trees should be planted on 40-foot centers, nor shrubs to be planted on eight-foot centers. The three-foot area nearest the right-of-way should be covered with lawn grass or plantings with low mature heights. (Figure 3 attached to Ordinance No. 99-019-ADM, section 4.) 
d.  A three-foot-high wall or fence of brick, stone or finished concrete, in addition to a four-foot wide minimum buffer strip on the right-of-way side of the wall or fence must be provided, and shall be planted with one tree per 40 feet of right-of-way frontage, not to be construed to mean trees should be planted on 40-foot centers. The wall of fence shall be set back from the driveway in such a manner as to provide a clear view within the sight triangle for ingress and egress. No plant material with a mature height of greater than 36 inches shall be planted within the sight triangle, and low hanging limbs of trees planted adjacent to the sight triangle whose limbs encroach into this area shall be trimmed to a minimum height of six feet above ground level. Lawn grass or ground cover, or shrubs should be placed on other areas within the buffer strip. (Figure 4 attached to Ordinance No. 99-019-ADM, section 4.) 
e.  If existing woodlands are available, a ten-foot-wide strip may be preserved in lieu of the landscape requirement, provided that the intended minimum density is not undermined. Underbrush should be removed to provide a neat streetscape appearance. Care should be taken to protect this reserve strip during construction. (Figure 5 attached to Ordinance No. 99-019-ADM, section 4.) 
2.  Perimeter landscaping shall be used around the edges of parking lots not adjoining street frontage as follows. The requirement for perimeter landscaping between adjacent parking lots does not preclude the need to provide vehicular access between lots. No plant material with a mature height of greater than 36 inches shall be planted within 30 feet along the boundary of the perimeter strip at each access to adjoining parking lots, and low-hanging limbs of trees planted adjacent to the line of sight whose limbs encroach into this area shall be trimmed to a minimum height of six feet above ground level. (Figure 6 attached to Ordinance No. 99-019-ADM, section 4.) 
a.  The perimeter landscape strip must be at least ten feet wide for parking lots larger than 10,000 square feet. One tree and three shrubs are required for every 40 feet of perimeter. This should not be construed to mean trees should be planted on 40-foot centers, nor shrubs to be planted on 13-foot centers. 
b.  The perimeter landscape strip must be at least five feet wide for parking lots less than 10,000 square feet, but having more than 20 spaces. One tree and three shrubs are required for every 40 feet of perimeter. This should not be construed to mean trees should be planted on 40-foot centers, nor shrubs to be planted on 13-foot centers. 
c.  If existing woodlands are available, a ten-foot-wide strip may be preserved in lieu of the perimeter landscape requirement, provided that the intended minimum density in not undermined. Underbrush should be removed to provide a neat appearance. Care should be taken to protect this reserve strip during construction. 
3.  Interior landscaping shall be used to provide relief from rows of parked cars as well as adding shade and serving as windbreaks. Planting islands assist with vehicular circulation as well. All areas within the parking lot's perimeter shall be included in the computation of parking lot area, except those used for street and perimeter landscaping and those interior driveways with no parking spaces located on either side as follows. (Figure 7 attached to Ord. No. 99-091-ADM.)

b.  No tree planting area may be less than five feet wide in any direction. Sixty square feet of area is required for each tree. 
c.  Planting islands should be spaced as evenly as practical throughout the parking lot. These should consist of planted end caps at the ends of parking rows, islands, divider medians perpendicular to parking rows and separating them, or landscape peninsulas which protrude from street or perimeter planted areas or from divider medians. 
d.  One tree and four shrubs shall be required per 200 square feet of landscaped area. 
e.  Trees planted at the ends of parking rows shall be trimmed of lower limbs below six feet above the ground to establish a line of sight for pulling into traffic lanes. 
f.  Planted areas within parking lots shall be defined by curbing. 
(Ord. No. 99-019-ADM, § 5, 8-24-99) 
Sec. 38-287. - Buffers. 
    In order to decrease incompatibility between neighboring uses, the following standards shall apply to all buffers required by the zoning ordinance. The use of evergreen trees and shrubs are encouraged in buffer planting to insure screening year round. 
(a)  When natural vegetation exists on a site, buffer areas may be left in a natural state, except that underbrush may be cleared and plantings added. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing removal of junk, debris, dead trees or limbs, abandoned structures, fences and the like from the buffer areas. 
(b)  The buffer shall provide a visually impervious barrier, uniformly dense at all heights from the ground, and a minimum of five feet above grade throughout the entire length of the planting strip at the time the plantings are installed. Within one year after installation the buffer shall be at least six feet above grade throughout the entire length of the planting. 
(c)  Privacy walls or fences, if incorporated in the buffer, shall be visually impervious, at least six feet high, and shall be used in conjunction with landscaping materials which compliment the purpose of the required buffer. Chain link fence shall not be used as a privacy fence. The location of the fence or wall within the buffer shall be provided to the city for permitting purposes. The fence or wall height shall be decreased to allow for sight distance near roadways. 
(d)  All walls and fences located within buffer areas shall be finished on the exterior viewed from adjacent properties. All walls and fences shall be maintained in perpetuity by the owner. 
(e)  The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of all landscaping materials, barriers and irrigation systems. All plant materials shall be tended and maintained in a healthy growing condition, replaced when dead and kept free of weeds, refuse and debris. 
(Ord. No. 99-019-ADM, § 6, 8-24-99) 
Sec. 38-288. - Landscape standards. 
(a)  [Residential lots.] [Owners of] residential lots, in addition to street trees, are encouraged to install lawn grass or other ground cover along with additional trees and shrubbery within the lot. 
(b)  Multifamily (to include townhomes and condominiums). Commercial, industrial, and institutional uses shall have a continuous landscape area a minimum width of six feet provided along the front and sides of all structures. This landscape area may contain trees, shrubs, flowering plants, lawns, ground cover, and mulch, or a combination of these items. This area may be penetrated only by sidewalk connections to building entrances, or driveways and loading areas. 
(Ord. No. 99-019-ADM, § 7, 8-24-99) 
Sec. 38-289. - Submittal procedure. 
    A conceptual landscape plan shall be submitted with the development or subdivision plan. This plan will be reviewed by the tree committee or city landscape supervisor or designee prior to the subdivision hearing before planning and zoning, or prior to issuance of the building permit. This plan shall indicate plantings within common areas and generally reflect the number of street trees based upon the amount of roadway footage along the lot or lots. (Note: It is understood that the developer may sell these lots to builders or to individuals who will determine the placement of trees upon specific lots in accordance with the building plans and the placement of the driveways and utilities.) 
(a)  The developer shall submit a master site plan in sufficient detail to indicate that the tree and landscape requirements will be met. The following information shall be included: 
1.  General information: A north arrow and scale of one inch to no more than 50 feet; all property lines and dimensions thereof; locations of all existing and proposed public and private easements and rights-of-way. 
2.  Construction information: The location of all buildings or the general location of proposed buildings including required setbacks; locations, dimensions and treatments of all new frontage, perimeter and interior landscaping areas; utility facilities, including known or proposed light poles, pedestals, control boxes; and fire hydrants should be shown. For development other than residential, the location and number of parking spaces, the amount, in square feet, of off-street parking area and intended surface treatments and the total amount in square feet, of interior landscaping in peninsulas and islands. 
3.  [Existing trees.] Existing trees to be incorporated into the street tree, perimeter, or buffer requirements may be noted on the plan by any desired designation as long as it is clearly defined by a legend indicating what the symbol indicates. 
4.  [New trees.] New trees to be incorporated into the street tree, perimeter, or buffer requirements may be noted on the plan by any desired designation as long as it is clearly defined by a legend indicating what the symbol indicates. 
(b)  Review shall be done in conjunction with subdivision or site plan review so as not to impede the approval process; however, if an alternate plan approval or arbitration is requested, additional time may be required. 
(c)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any new development that has not met the requirements of this article. All required landscaping, including street trees, buffers, and any parking lot landscaping, shall be installed prior to occupancy. Additions or renovations to existing parking areas shall be reviewed prior to usage. In the case of a developer, any landscaping in common areas shall be reviewed prior to acceptance of the streets for city maintenance. When circumstances preclude immediate planting, the tree commission. City landscape supervisor or designee may release the development for a certificate of occupancy after (1) the owner or developer has completed all curbing, irrigation systems and other nonplanting components of the landscaping plan, and (2) posted a bond or cash (certified check or certificate) in an amount equal to 110 percent of the total cost, including labor, of the remaining landscaping installation, but in no case shall the time period exceed six months after the date the certificate of occupancy is issued. 
(d)  In commercial, industrial, and institutional developments, the owner or lessee shall each be responsible for providing, maintaining and protecting all landscaping in a healthy and growing condition, and for keeping it free from refuse and debris. All unhealthy and dead materials shall be replaced during the next appropriate planting period. At no time shall the parking area landscaping be reduced to less than is required by this article and the approved landscaping plan. Failure of the developer or owner to comply with the approved landscaping plan and or failure to provide maintenance of such shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 99-019-ADM, § 8, 8-24-99) 
Sec. 38-290. - Enforcement. 
    The city shall notify the owner and or occupant of any violation of this article by written notice delivered in person or by certified mail. The offense shall be stated and a period of ten working days shall be given to allow the correction to be made or a written request for arbitration to be submitted. A request to extend the ten-day time limit may be requested in writing when completion of the work within the ten-day limit is deemed impractical due to the scope of the work or weather conditions or other definable condition. The extension request shall state a date by which the correction will be accomplished. Approval or denial will be made by the tree commission, the city landscape supervisor, or designee. 
    Failure to comply with the terms of this article after notice by personal service or by certified mail shall constitute a violation. Return of the certified mail receipt, either signed or unclaimed, shall constitute prima facie evidence of notice. The Code of Alabama prescribes the penalty for a municipal ordinance violation as a fine not to exceed $500.00 and/or imprisonment not to exceed six months.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 46-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title II, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24, Chapter 45, Sections 1-11, Chapter 52, Sections 1-84, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Trussville, Alabama, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2016-019-ADM, art. 1, § A, 5-10-16) 
Sec. 46-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Trussville, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2016-019-ADM, art. 1, § B, 5-10-16) 
Sec. 46-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 2016-019-ADM, art. 1, § C, 5-10-16) 
Sec. 46-34. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this ordinance, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this ordinance, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 2016-019-ADM, art. 4, § A, 5-10-16) 
Sec. 46-82. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 46-81(4), "elevated buildings." 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 46-63(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet). 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (Refer: section 46-81). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on it's wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 46-82(3)a. and c. above. 
(4)  Standards for subdivisions. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(Ord. No. 2016-019-ADM, art. 4, § B, 5-10-16) 
Sec. 46-83. - Floodways. 
    Floodway . Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-42, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(3)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of [44 Code of Federal Regulations Section] 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(4)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(5)  Only if subsections (2), (3) or (4), above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 2016-019-ADM, art. 4, § C, 5-10-16) 
Sec. 46-84. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-42, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 46-42, then the engineering and inspections department (floodplain administrator) shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data is not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (4) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of sections 46-81 and 46-82(1) through (4). 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of section 46-82(3)b.2. in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 46-81(4), "elevated buildings". 
The engineering and inspections department (floodplain administrator) shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 2016-019-ADM, art. 4, § D, 5-10-16) 
Sec. 46-85. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-42, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 46-81(4), "elevated buildings." 
The engineering and inspections department (administrator) shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level or two feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 46-62(1)c. and (2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

Sec. 46-101. - [In general.] 
(a)  The board of zoning adjustment as established by the City Council of the City of Trussville (local unit) shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the engineering and inspections department in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning adjustment may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court of Jefferson County or the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, whichever is applicable, as provided in the Code of Ala., 1974, § 11-52-81. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The engineering and inspections department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; (2) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.

ARTICLE II. - RIGHTS-OF-WAY 

Sec. 78-26. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide principles, procedures and associated funding for the placement of equipment and infrastructure, construction, and excavation encroachments and work activities within or upon any public rights-of-way and to protect the integrity of the road, utility and telecommunications systems. To achieve this purpose, it is necessary to require permits, to establish permit procedures and statements, and to fix and collect fees and charges. 
(b)  Objectives. It is recognized that there is a need to accommodate multiple entities in their provision of public services. However, the city must ensure that the primary purpose of the roadway, passage of vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. The use of the roadway corridors (i.e., rights-of-way) by others is secondary to the movement of traffic. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of the rights-of-way for location of equipment by public and private entities. This article thus has several objectives: 
(1)  To ensure that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience in minimized. 
(2)  To protect the city's infrastructure investment by establishing repair standards for all street improvements when work in the rights-of-way is undertaken. 
(3)  To facilitate work within the right-of-way through the standardization of regulations and hardware placements. 
(4)  To maintain an efficient permit process. 
(5)  To conserve the limited physical capacity of the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the city. 
(6)  To ensure that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect public health, safety and welfare.

Sec. 78-37. - Standards for repairs. 
(a)  Permittee responsibility. The permittee shall be fully responsible for the cost and actual performance of all work in the public right-of-way. The permittee shall do all work in conformance with any and all engineering regulations, construction specifications, and design standards adopted by the city. Any such standards adopted by the city shall apply to all work in the public right-of-way unless otherwise indicated in the permit. 
(b)  Specific standards relating to work in the public right-of-way. All final restoration of the worksite shall result in a work site condition at least equal to that which existed prior to construction, to the extent practicable. In addition to the regulations, specifications and standards referred to in subsection (a), the following provisions shall apply to all work in the public right-of-way within the city: 
(1)  Pavement cuts shall be filled with compacted select material. Either concrete or asphalt patches will be placed to match the existing street cross section. Select material shall include select fill, stone or controlled density (flowable) fill. 
(2)  For pavement cuts, select fill shall be placed in an excavation in eight-inch lifts and compacted with a vibratory plate compactor (for small openings), jumping jack (alongside pipelines), or with a static roller (for large openings). Compaction by backhoe bucket is never acceptable. In cases where groundwater is present, stone shall be substituted for select fill. 
(3)  In cases where it is impossible to achieve required compaction of 20 CBR on select fill, the city encourages the use of controlled density fill material. When controlled density fill type material is used, steel plate will be placed to cover the opening for the time required to allow the material to set. The controlled density fill material shall be course sand or fine, one-quarter inch limestone, or equivalent. 
(4)  Once the compacted backfill has been placed, an asphalt cutback shall be made. The cutback will extend six inches minimum on each side of the opening and will be over undisturbed pavement material (one and one-half-inch deep minimum). All edges of the opening shall be neatly cut with an asphalt saw and uniformly tact. A temporary patch shall be placed for a period of 15 to 30 days to allow settlement of fill materials. 
(5)  After the settlement period described in subsection (b)(4), the new asphalt will be placed in lifts (three-inch maximum) and compacted upon placement. Asphalt depths will be governed by the existing cross section of the street but not less than four inches of full deep asphalt shall be used to fill a street cut regardless of the existing cross section. Concrete shall be used to replace concrete pavement wherever it occurs. 
(6)  Damage to curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and inlets shall be repaired so as to comply with any applicable subdivision regulations. 
(Ord. No. 97-012 ADM, § 12, 5-27-97) 
Sec. 78-38. - Construction and restoration standards for newly constructed or overlayed streets. 
(a)  Application required. As a result of the degradation to newly constructed or overlayed streets caused by excavation, no person shall excavate an area in the pavement of any public right-of-way for a period of five years from the completion of construction or resurfacing except in compliance with the provision of this section. (Persons holding permits issued under subsection 78-29(e) shall not be required to obtain a permit under this section 78-38) Any application for a permit to work in a public right-of-way subject to the requirements of this section shall contain the following information: 
(1)  A detailed and dimensional engineering plan that identifies and accurately represents the public right-of-way or property that will be impacted by the proposed excavation, as well as the side streets at the end of each city block that may be impacted. The following information shall also be included on the plan: 
a.  The street width including curb and gutter over the total length of each city block that will be impacted by the proposed excavation. 
b.  The location, width and depth of the proposed excavation. 
c.  The total area of existing pavement in each individual city block that will be impacted by the proposed excavation. 
(2)  A written statement addressing the criteria for approval. 
(b)  Criteria for approval. No permit for excavation in a right-of-way of new streets shall be approved unless the director finds that all of the following criteria have been met: 
(1)  Boring or jacking under the pavement is not practical due to physical characteristics of the right-of-way or other utility conflicts. 
(2)  Alternative utility alignments that do not involve excavating within the right-of-way are found to be impracticable. 
(3)  The proposed excavation cannot reasonably be delayed until after the five-year deferment period has lapsed. 
(c)  Exemptions for emergency operations. Emergency maintenance operation shall be limited to circumstances involving the preservation of life, property, or the restoration of customer utility service. Persons with prior authorization from the city, or authorized under section 78-40, to perform emergency maintenance operations within the public right-of-way shall be exempted from this subsection. Any person commencing operations pursuant to this subsection shall submit detailed engineering plans and remediation plans no later than five working days after initiating the emergency maintenance operation. 
(d)  Construction and restoration standards for newly constructed or overlayed portions of public rights-of-way. The public right-of-way shall be repaired so as not to reduce the useful life of the pavement in accordance with design and construction standards adopted by the city. If the total area of the proposed excavation exceeds 15 percent of the total area of pavement within a block or involves a trench in excess of 150 feet in length, the applicant shall remediate the damage caused to the pavement. Remediation will consist of a curb to curb profile and overlay, a centerlined curb profile and overlay, or a lane line to curb profile and overlay, whichever is necessary in order not to decrease the average life expectancy of the right-of-way surface. 
(Ord. No. 97-012 ADM, § 13, 5-27-97) 
Sec. 78-39. - Relocation of facilities. 
    If at any time the city requests the permittee to relocate its equipment, telecommunications facilities or utility facilities, in order to allow the city to make any public use of the right-of-way, or if at any time it shall become necessary for any purpose to improve, repair, construct or maintain any public right-of-way, or for reasons of traffic conditions, public safety, or reason of installation of any type of structure of public improvement, to move or change the permittee's facilities within or adjacent to streets or public right-of-way in any manner, either temporarily or permanently, the city shall notify the permittee, at least 90 days in advance, except in the case of emergencies, of the city's intention to perform or have such work performed. The permittee shall thereupon, at its sole cost and expense, accomplish the necessary relocation, removal or change within a reasonable time from the date of the notification, but in no event later than three working days prior to the date the city has notified the permittee that it intends to commence its work or immediately in the case of emergencies. Upon the permittee's failure to accomplish such work, the city or other public agency, may perform such work at the permittee's expense, and the permittee shall reimburse the city or other agency within 30 days after receipt of a written invoice. Following the relocation, all affected property shall be restored to, at a minimum, the condition which existed prior to construction, at the permittee's expense. 
(Ord. No. 97-012 ADM, § 14, 5-27-97) 
Sec. 78-40. - Emergency procedures. 
    Any person maintaining equipment, telecommunications facilities or utility facilities in the public right-of-way may proceed with repairs upon existing facilities without a permit when emergency circumstances demand that the work be done immediately. Work necessary to restore water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone, and cable television facilities is considered emergency work. Repairs on other facilities in the public rights-of-way may also be administratively classified as emergency work by the director. Unless the person doing the work holds an annual permit issued under subsection 78-29(e), he or she shall apply to the city for a permit on the first working day after such work has commenced. All emergency work which will block traffic for more than one hour on any street will require prior telephone notification to the city police department and fire department.

Sec. 78-43. - Penalties.

    The Alabama Supreme Court entered an order amending Rule 20, Alabama Rules of Judicial Administration, effective July 1, 1994, for use by the municipal court magistrates in receiving pleas of guilt and assessing fines therefore. Under this rule municipalities are given authority by ordinance to adopt this rule, in whole or in part, the Supreme Court's extended schedule of fines to apply in minor ordinance violation cases or cases charging violations of a rule or regulation promulgated by a state agency or department and incorporated in municipal ordinances, wherein a defendant elects to plead guilty before a magistrate. Municipalities are also authorized to extend local schedules of fines by ordinance, subject to the limitations imposed in subsection (D) of Rule 20. 
    Rule 20 of the Alabama Rules of Judicial Administration further provides for a "uniform nontraffic citation and complaint," which is designed as the instrument for charging a person with a nontraffic municipal ordinance violation. Rule 20 mandates that the uniform nontraffic citation and complaint be used as the charging instrument for all scheduled nontraffic municipal ordinance violations and minor misdemeanors and directs that each law enforcement agency must issue the uniform nontraffic citation and complaint for use by each officer.

(Ord. No. 2007-001 PS, § 1, 1-9-07) 
Sec. 86-356. - Council findings. 
    The City Council of the City of Trussville finds and declares all of the following: 
(a)  Driving a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways is a privilege, not a right, and only properly licensed drivers are entitled to operate a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways. 
(b)  Significant numbers of drivers whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked continue to drive regardless of the law. 
(c)  Unlicensed drivers or drivers with suspended, revoked or expired licenses frequently cause traffic accidents involving properly licensed drivers. Many of these accidents are serious in nature, and those properly licensed drivers then become victims who suffer considerable pain and property loss as a result of the failure of others who fail to abide by the law. 
(d)  It is necessary and appropriate to take additional steps to prevent unlicensed drivers from driving when detected and to deter unlicensed drivers from driving at any time. The city has a critical interest in prohibiting said drivers from continuing to operate a motor vehicle when interdicted or detected, and further to temporarily remove the motor vehicle from the public streets so as to prohibit further immediate operation of the vehicle by the offender. 
(e)  The city has a critical interest in enforcing its traffic laws and in keeping unlicensed drivers from illegally driving. Impounding the vehicles driven by unlicensed drivers under appropriate circumstances shall prohibit continued illegal operation of the vehicle and ensure that the vehicle may not then be used by said unlicensed driver. Said removal serves a significant and legitimate governmental and public interest, namely the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Trussville from the potential harm caused by unlicensed drivers. 
(Ord. No. 2007-001 PS, § 2, 1-9-07) 
Sec. 86-357. - Driver's license required. 
    Notwithstanding any provision of law, no person shall be allowed to operate a motor vehicle upon the streets and public highways of Trussville, Alabama, without a current, valid driver's license. If a driver is unable to produce a current, valid driver's license upon demand of a law enforcement officer, the driver shall be immediately removed from the vehicle, and shall not be permitted to further operate said vehicle unless: 
(a)  The officer is reasonably able to verify by other means that the driver is properly licensed; or 
(b)  The license of the driver expired within the preceding 90 days and the driver would otherwise have been properly licensed; or 
(c)  There is an emergency or medical necessity jeopardizing life or limb either for one of the vehicle occupants or which requires the immediate response by that law enforcement officer at another location, and, in the officer's discretion, continued operation of the vehicle is necessary. 
(Ord. No. 2007-001 PS, § 3, 1-9-07) 
Sec. 86-358. - Impoundment of vehicle. 
    In the event that the officer cannot verify that a person is properly licensed, that the person would have been properly licensed but for the expiration of his or her license within the preceding 90 days, or continued operation of the vehicle is necessary because of an emergency to life or limb as provided heretofore, the vehicle being driven shall be impounded regardless of ownership or possessory interest of the operator or person present in the vehicle unless the registered owner of the vehicle or another family member of the owner is immediately present, is identifiable as the owner or family member of the owner, is legally licensed to operate the vehicle, and no other circumstances exist which would interfere with the owner's operation of the vehicle. In the event that the vehicle is impounded, the occupants of the vehicle shall be transported to a place of safety. 
(Ord. No. 2007-001 PS, § 4, 1-9-07) 
Sec. 86-359. - Release of impounded vehicle. 
    A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall be released if: 
(a)  The registered owner or a representative with written notarized authorization to act on behalf of the registered owner appears at the police department, and presents a valid driver's license, a copy of the title, tag receipt or notarized bill of sale, and a copy of the written authorization, if applicable, to be copied by the police department. 
(b)  If the registered owner does not have a valid driver's license, he/she may bring someone with him/her who has a verified valid license, and the vehicle may be released to that person without written notarized permission. 
    Any vehicle not claimed within the time period provided by Code of Ala. 1975, title 32, chapter 13, as it may be amended from time to time, may be disposed of in accordance with that Alabama Code chapter or other municipal ordinance concerning same. 
(Ord. No. 2007-001 PS, § 5, 1-9-07) 
Sec. 86-360. - Impound charge. 
    The person redeeming the vehicle at the impoundment lot will be responsible for all charges relevant to towing and storage of the vehicle.

Such a map shall be maintained in the custody of the City Clerk. 
ARTICLE II. - PURPOSE 
    The zoning regulations and districts as herein established have been made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to regulate signs; to avoid undue concentrations of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sanitary waste disposal, schools, parks, and other public improvements. The regulations have also been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city. 
ARTICLE III. - GENERAL REGULATIONS 

Sec. 1.0. - General use regulations.

C.  The minimum building line, parking spaces, open spaces, including minimum lot area, required by this appendix for each and every building existing at the time of the passage of this appendix or for any building hereafter erected, shall not be encroached upon or considered as a required building or open space for any other building, nor shall any lot area be reduced below the requirements of this appendix. Notwithstanding the above, binding agreements for joint use of parking areas may be allowed as described in the Parking requirements, article IX, section 3.1. 
D.  Every residential building in a single-family residential district hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on a lot as herein defined and in no case shall there be more than one main building on one lot. Accessory structures shall not be used for residential nor commercial uses. Neither will sanitary facilities be permitted in accessory structures without the approval of the Trussville City Council. 
E.  In any zoning district other than a single-family residential district more than one main building may be allowed on one lot provided that said buildings and property are under common ownership. 
    1.3 Joint occupancy. No structure shall be erected, structurally altered for, or used as a dwelling simultaneously with any other use, except as expressly provided for in this appendix. 
    1.4 Public utilities. Utility structures including, but not limited to, poles, wires, cross arms, transformers attached to poles, guy wires, insulators, conduits and other facilities necessary for the transmission or distribution of electric power or to provide telecommunications service; and pipe lines, vents, valves, hydrants, regulators, meters and other facilities necessary for the transmission or distribution of gas, oil, water or other utilities may be constructed, erected, repaired, maintained or replaced within any district within the city subject to the provisions and/or conditions contained in other applicable city ordinances. This is not to be construed to include the erection or construction of buildings, towers or electric substations or gas or water pumping or regulator stations. Electric substations and gas or water pumping or regulator stations are special exception uses in all zoning districts of the city. 
    1.5 Zoning of abandoned right-of-way. Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the city, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of same and all area included therein shall then be subject to all appropriate regulations to the extended district. 
    1.6 Zoning requirements for moving buildings. Any building or structure which is to be moved to any location within the city limits of Trussville, shall be considered for the purpose of this appendix to be a new building under construction, and as such shall conform to the applicable provisions of this appendix.

Accessory structures on a corner lot shall be set back not less than the minimum front yard depth required on the side street. 
    1.9 Future street lines. Any lot existing at the time of adoption of this appendix or at the time this appendix is hereafter amended, which may be reduced in area by the widening of an existing public street to a future street line or by a future proposed street as indicated on a duly adopted "master plan" as it may from time to time be amended, shall allow sufficient area for the minimum required yards, the minimum required lot area, the minimum required lot width and the maximum building area to be measured by considering the future street line or lines as the lot line of such lot. 
    1.10 Abatement of noise, lighting, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, fire, radio interference, explosion hazard or nuisance. The building official may require any use, conforming or nonconforming, which results in unreasonable noise, lighting, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, fire, radio interference, or explosion hazard or nuisance to surrounding property to be modified or changed to abate such hazard to health, comfort, and convenience. 
    1.11 Annexed property. In utilizing the "zone most comparable" approach, any property annexed into the city shall automatically be placed into the city zoning district classification that is most comparable with the zoning classification that had been applied to the property prior to its annexation into the city. At such time as said property is annexed into the city, the appropriate city zoning classification shall be applied to the property and said city zoning classification shall be incorporated into said ordinance annexing said property into the city. When unzoned property is annexed into the city, the city shall begin zoning procedures so that the property may be assigned a classification based on the use of the land when annexed. The zoning procedures will be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of article X and state law. 
    (See appendix A for a listing of zones employed by Jefferson County, along with a list depicting comparable zones utilized by the City of Trussville.) 
(Ord. No. 2001-036-PZ, § 1(2), 11-27-01; Ord. No. 2016-004-PZ, § 3, 2-9-16) 
Sec. 2.0. - Nonconforming uses. 
    Within the districts established by this appendix or amendments that may be later adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the article was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this appendix or future amendment. 
A.  On nonconforming lots or structures which were lawful before the article was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this appendix or future amendment, and where there is not a question of a nonconforming use, relief may be sought from the board of zoning adjustment on dimensional considerations. No nonconforming setback may be further reduced, but the existing nonconforming setback may be extended along the same plane. However, in the Downtown Overlay district, where a maximum front yard setback applies, a nonconforming setback may not be increased though it may be extended along the same plane. 
B.  It is the intent of this appendix to permit nonconforming uses of land which were lawful before the article was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this appendix or future amendment, to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this appendix that nonconforming uses of land shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, transferred, nor used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
    2.1 Nonconforming lots of record. Where a lot of record at the time of the effective date of this appendix had less area or less width than herein required for the district in which it is located, said lot may be used as a building site provided the yard space and other requirements conform as closely as possible to the regulations found in the applicable district as determined by the board of zoning adjustment. However, this provision shall not apply when two or more such lots exist with continuous frontage in single ownership at the time of passage of this appendix or any time thereafter. Such land shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this appendix and shall not be used or sold in a manner which creates lot dimensions or area below the requirements stated in this appendix. 
    2.2 Continuance. A lawful nonconforming use existing at the time of the effective date of this appendix may be continued, except as hereafter provided, although such use does not conform with the provisions of this appendix. 
    2.3 Change in use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
    2.4 Restoration after damages. A nonconforming building or structure which has been damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current replacement value at the time of such damage shall not be rebuilt or restored, except in conformity with the provisions of this appendix. If a nonconforming building is damaged less than 50 percent of its current replacement value it may be rebuilt or restored and used as before the damage, provided that such rebuilding or restoration is completed within 12 months of the date of such damage. Moreover, all debris from the damaged structure shall be removed within 90 days from the date of such destruction. 
    2.5 Restoration to safe condition. Nothing in this appendix shall prevent the restoration of any nonconforming building or structure to a safe or sanitary condition when required by the appropriate authorities. 
    2.6 Abandonment. A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a continuous period of six months shall not be re-established and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this appendix. 
    2.7 Reduction in lot area prohibited. No lot shall be reduced in area so that yards and other open spaces total less than the minimum area required under this appendix. 
(Ord. No. 2016-004-PZ, § 7, 2-9-16)

    12.7 Special exceptions. The board of zoning adjustment may hear and decide special exceptions as specifically authorized by this appendix, to determine whether special exceptions should be granted, and to grant special exceptions, to impose such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this appendix, or to deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this appendix.

C.  The board of adjustment has made a finding that it is empowered under the section of this appedix described in the application to grant the special exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not adversely affect the public interest.

Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this appendix and punishable as prescribed in this appendix.

    12.8 Variances. The board of zoning adjustment may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this appendix as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this appendix would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the appendix shall be observed and substantial justice done. 
A.  A variance from the terms of this appendix shall not be granted by the board of adjustment unless and until a written application for a variance plus an application fee is submitted demonstrating: 
1.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
2.  That literal interpretation of the provisions of this appendix would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this appendix; 
3.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
4.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this appendix to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
5.  That relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this appendix; and 
6.  That the variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings, or structures which is not permitted by right or by special exception in the district involved. 
B.  A hearing on the variance application will be held after proper notice is provided. Notice of public hearing shall be given by first class mail to the owner of the property for which the variance is sought or to his agent, and to the owners of all adjoining property, at least five days prior to the public hearing. The owner must personally attend the hearing or may choose to be represented by his agent or attorney. 
C.  The board of adjustment may only grant a variance after making a specific finding that the requirements of this section regarding a written application have been met by the applicant for a variance and the application fee paid, that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structures, and that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this appendix, will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
D.  In granting any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this appendix. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this appendix and punishable as prescribed in this appendix. 
E.  Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances, keeping in mind hardship alone is not sufficient. Demonstration of unnecessary hardship is required and financial loss of a kind which might be common to all of the property owners in similar situations is not grounds for a variance. Under no circumstances shall the board of adjustment grant a variance to permit a use not generally or by any special exception permitted in the district except as provided for in article IV, section 6.0-Interpretation of uses, and in article IV, section 7.0-Unclassified uses. 
    12.9 Board action on applications. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board of adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this appendix, reverse, or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have powers of the building official/administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.

Sec. 13.0. - Appeals from action of the board. 
    Any party aggrieved by any final judgment or decision of the board of zoning adjustment may appeal pursuant to state law. 
Sec. 14.0. - Limitation on requests to the board of zoning adjustment. 
    If the application is denied by the board of zoning adjustment, a second appeal, special exception, or variance request of the same kind on the same tract or parcel of land will not be considered until a period of one year has elapsed from the date of such action by the board. However, the board of zoning adjustment may adjust this time period, if in the opinion of a majority of the board, an unusual situation or circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing or that conditions in the area have changed, or that the request has changed. Each time the application is made, the required administration fee must be paid, and no sum or any part of the fee will be refunded for failure to approve such proposal.

Sec. 17.0. - Overlay district. 
    An overlay district may be established to give specific protection to certain areas within the City of Trussville having historical, environmental, development or other significance, or to impose additional requirements in certain geographic areas of the city, that are not applicable to all areas, for resource protection or for the protection of lives and property. An overlay district may be permanently established by this appendix or an amendment thereto, or may be of a temporary nature pending completion of a public works project or other temporary situation. An overlay district does not negate the requirements of the underlying district, but may create additional requirements, regulations, or documentation. 
    Overlay district regulations may be applied in any zoning district in applicable areas of the City of Trussville except for the planned unit development (PUD) district. However, the city council may consider overlay regulations in its review of PUD projects and may determine whether and to the extent those regulations should be reflected in a PUD plan. In such case, overlay district overlay regulations will only apply to the extent specifically incorporated into the PUD plan, as approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2016-004-PZ, § 5, 2-9-16) 
Sec. 18.0. - Cahaba River Conservation Overlay district (O-CR).

a.  Roads, bridges, and utilities are permitted within the stream setback/buffer subject to the following: 
i.  An analysis should be conducted to ensure that no economically feasible alternative is available. 
ii.  The right-of-way should be the minimum width needed to allow for maintenance access and installation. 
iii.  The angle of the crossing shall be perpendicular to the stream or buffer to minimize clearing requirements. 
iv.  The minimum number of road crossings shall be used within subdivisions, and no more that one fairway crossing is allowed for every 1,000 feet of buffer. 
3.  In new developments, on-site and nonstructural stormwater management alternatives will be preferred over larger facilities within the stream setback/buffer, and the cleared area will be limited to the area required for construction and adequate maintenance access in constructing stormwater management facilities, with material dredged or otherwise removed to be stored outside the buffer. 
4.  Upon submittal of a development plan or plat, waivers may be granted by the planning and zoning board for the following: 
a.  Those projects or activities serving a public need where no feasible alternative is available.

H.  Development controls. Developers are encouraged to respond creatively to both the market and the critical environmental values of the area, as well as to the needs and values of the city and the citizens. 
1.  The applicant shall prepare an erosion and sedimentation control plan to minimize, to the maximum extent possible, the discharge of sediments to the Cahaba River. This plan shall be consistent with the practices set forth by the Jefferson County Stormwater Management Authority or the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, whichever is applicable. 
2.  The applicant shall demonstrate that development will not significantly increase the likelihood of chemical or other biohazard runoff in adverse amounts into the Cahaba River which could be damaging to the ecosystem of the river, or the applicant shall propose modifications to the plan to retain runoff on the site to bring the project into conformance with ADEM standards. 
3.  The applicant shall demonstrate, using methodology for small urban watersheds for a 25-year, 24-hour storm, that the total volume of stormwater discharged from the site in its post development condition shall not exceed the total runoff in its predevelopment condition. If this analysis demonstrates that this standard will not be met, the applicant shall propose modifications to the plan to retain runoff on the site to bring the project into conformance with this standard. 
a.  If stormwater detention facilities are required, said facilities will be engineered to retain the first one-half inch of storm runoff for residential development and the first one and one-half inches of storm runoff for commercial and industrial development. 
b.  All stormwater releases shall be at non-erosive velocities as may be accomplished by constructed velocity breaks, elevation drops, or other generally accepted engineering practices. 
4.  Notwithstanding any of the above, in areas of Trussville where the flood hazard has been determined and that are subject to periodic inundation which may results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and/or extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, all development shall be done in accordance with the city flood damage prevention ordinance. The standards for flood plain development shall apply to any land delineated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) whether or not the base flood elevation has been determined.

    19A.7 Access and parking standards. 
A.  U.S. 11 Access. Access to U.S. Highway 11 is subject to the approval of the Alabama Department of Transportation which may prescribe greater standards than those provided herein. Access points to U.S. 11 shall be spaced as far apart as is practical. Unless otherwise approved by the Trussville Planning and Zoning Board, no access point shall be located closer than 200 feet from the nearest adjacent access point. The planning and zoning board may approve an access point closer than 200 feet to the nearest adjacent access point in its discretion upon a determination that one or more of the following factors support same: no other access is available to a parcel of land, access is necessary to permit use of the parcel, access will be beneficial to traffic flow from other parcels, access will not promote unsafe conditions for automobiles or pedestrians, and the use of shared driveways, internal connections and other alternatives are deemed impracticable. 
B.  Access between parcels. Front and rear parking lots shall be designed so as to permit and encourage connectivity between parcels. Where an adjacent parcel is not developed compatibly, parking areas shall be designed so as to permit future connections by utilizing a paved "stub out" to the property line or other similar feature to permit connections if compatible development is pursued in the future. If rear access between parcels is not prohibited by topography or unique design features, it should be provided so as to permit service vehicles to access adjacent parcels without being required to exit onto U.S. 11. 
C.  Parking. Parking in front of any building shall be permitted but shall be limited to two rows of double-loaded parking. A landscaped buffer must be provided in between all parking areas and any public or private road or driveway. The buffer is not required to screen the buildings from visibility, but must be of such character and nature to minimize the visibility and impact of any such parking areas. Such buffer areas are not required for buildings without front parking areas; provided, however, that, in such case, the front yard shall be landscaped. 
    19A.8 Landscaping, buffers and pedestrian ways. In order to provide for and promote compatibility between uses within the overlay district and to provide a transition to residential districts in said area, the following standards concerning the streetscape and the area between buildings and U.S. Highway 11 shall apply, as generally depicted in Ex. 1: 
A.  Right-of-way improvements. The right-of-way between the back curb of U.S. 11 and the right-of-way line of U.S. 11 which abuts the parcel must be improved and landscaped with a grassed buffer strip subject to Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) approval. 
B.  Sidewalks. Within or adjacent to the U.S. 11 right-of-way and adjacent to the grassed buffer strip, improved pedestrian sidewalks must be provided. Said sidewalk shall be a minimum of six feet in width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the Trussville subdivision regulations and any Greenways Plans which have been adopted by the city. Pedestrian rights-of-way may be dedicated to the city or provided by way of right-of-way easement. 
C.  Landscape buffer. If parking or an access drive is utilized along the front of any building, a tree-lined landscaped buffer strip of no less than five feet shall be required between the sidewalk and said parking lot. If the front yard or front building setback area is not utilized for parking, no such buffer will be required; provided however that the front yard must be fully landscaped in that instance. Street trees must be planted along the edge of the sidewalk nearest the building, either in the required buffer or in the front yard immediately adjacent to the sidewalk, if no buffer is required. Street trees, as specified in the tree conservation and landscape planning ordinance of the City of Trussville, must be planted approximately 50 feet on center. Said trees must be three inches in caliper or greater. 
D.  Trees and landscaping. Landscaping of the site shall be provided in accordance with the tree conservation and landscape planning ordinance of the city. All landscaped areas shall be irrigated and plant materials shall be installed using best practices so as to maximize viability of the material. Existing, mature trees should be utilized as part of the landscaping on each site where practicable. 
    19A.9 Lighting. 
A.  Lighting shall have underground electric service, except where the lights, service poles and wires are not visible from public property. 
B.  The intensity, location and design of lighting shall be such that glare is minimized onto adjacent property or the public right-of-way. Light fixtures shall be designed to cast light downward and not horizontally. Where necessary, cut-off devices shall be used to minimize glare off premises. 
C.  Light poles and fixtures should be ornamental in nature, should be colored black, and should compliment or match the lighting in the downtown business district. 
D.  Flashing, blinking or intermittent lights and neon tubing are prohibited. 
    19A.10 Signage.

Planning board hearing: The planning and zoning board shall schedule a hearing on the application at the first regularly scheduled meeting after compliance with the application and notice provisions as set forth herein. The application will not be considered to be submitted until all materials are received and the processing fee paid. A minimum of 14 days prior to the planning and zoning board meeting at which the conditional use request is to be considered, the city clerk shall mail notification to all adjacent property owners. The notice shall state the location of the conditional use request, the nature of the request, including the current zoning classification, and the date, time and place of the meeting at which the request will be considered. The planning and zoning board shall submit a recommendation to the city council as to whether such requested conditional use should be approved as submitted, approved with modifications, or denied. Should the recommendation from the planning and zoning board be for denial of the application, the applicant shall have the option of withdrawing the application, or of continuing the process to present the application to the city council. Any decision to withdraw the application, shall be given in writing to the city clerk. 
City council hearing: Upon receipt of the recommendation from the planning and zoning board, the city clerk shall schedule and advertise the proposed conditional use request for a public hearing before the city council. Notice shall be mailed to adjacent property owners a minimum of seven days prior to the city council hearing. The city council shall review the request, the recommendation from the planning and zoning board and any and all materials submitted in conjunction with the request, and will consider whether the conditional use should be permitted, and, if so, whether conditions should be required so as to render the use compatible with surrounding properties and uses thereupon, the downtown master plan, other master plans of the city or as is otherwise in the best interest of the city and its residents. 
Denial: When the city council denies a conditional use request, the planning and zoning board shall not reconsider the same request for a period of one year. However, the planning and zoning board may adjust this time period, if in the opinion of a majority of the board an unusual situation or circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing, or that conditions in the area have changed, or that the request has changed. Each time an application is made, the required administrative fee must be paid, and no sum or any part of the fee will be refunded for failure to approve such proposal. 
Expiration/revocation: Approval of a conditional use shall be considered exercised when the use has been established or when the building permit has been issued and substantial construction accomplished. A conditional use approval shall lapse and be of no effect if, after the expiration of one year from the date of city council approval, no construction or change in use pursuant to such conditional use has taken place, provided however, that the council may, for good cause shown, specify a longer period of time in conjunction with its action to approve a conditional use. When such use is abandoned or discontinued for a period of one year, it shall not be reestablished, unless authorized by the city council after a new application and approval through the conditional use process. Conditional use approval shall be revoked when the applicant fails to comply with the conditions improved by the city council.

When a range is provided, the lower number represents the minimum front yard setback and the higher number is the maximum front yard setback. The area between these setback lines is the "required frontage area." 2   Separation from buildings on the same or adjoining lots is determined by the building code. Where a property within the downtown overlay district abuts a residentially zoned property, the setback requirements for accessory structures in article VII, section 6.0 shall apply.  
    19B.6 Parking and access standards. Except as otherwise provided herein, off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with article IX, off-street parking and loading requirements. 
A.  Parking. 
1.  Whenever there is a change in use of an existing premises, minimum parking requirements shall be met. 
2.  Driveway, parking and circulation areas may be designed with pervious pavers and similar pervious materials approved by the building official. The use of pervious paving materials may be advantageous in meeting impervious surface cover limitations. 
3.  The amount of parking specified in article IX shall be required except as follows: 
a.  Required parking provided collectively or jointly amongst mixed uses may be modified or reduced, if supported by a shared parking study conducted by a professional engineer performed in accordance with the techniques cited in the latest edition of "shared parking" as published by the Urban Land Institute. The reduction of such required parking when shared parking is utilized is applicable to mixed uses on the same premises or on multiple abutting premises. Approval of such shared parking will be the responsibility of the city council upon recommendation of the planning commission. 
b.  The city council, upon a recommendation by the planning and zoning board, may waive or modify parking requirements and instead accept a fee-in-lieu for all or a portion of the required parking. Such fee-in-lieu shall be used by the city to develop and improve on- and off-street public parking facilities within the downtown overlay district. The fee-in-lieu shall be equal to the costs, as determined by the city, for that portion of the required parking requested by the developer or owner to be waived. 
B.  Access. 
1.  Direct access from Chalkville Road shall be minimized. Wherever possible, access shall be provided from minor streets, through a shared access drive, cross access or alley. All driveways shall be separated from other driveways, alleys and intersections with streets in accordance with Table 19B.4. Main Street is an ALDOT roadway and will fall under their guidelines. Access to Main Street is controlled by the Alabama Department of Transportation and as such shall meet their requirements. 
2.  Off-street parking spaces may be directly accessed from an alley provided the building official determines there is sufficient maneuvering space. 
3.  No more than one driveway shall be permitted per premises per street frontage where other access options arc readily available. However, upon recommendation from the public works director, a second access may be permitted by the planning and zoning board where the street frontage of the premises for which the second access is requested is greater than 250 feet. 
Table 19B.3 Access Management Standards Minimum Separation from Intersection Arterial 200 Collector 125 Minor Street 75  
    19B.7 Sidewalks. Development of any parcel in the downtown overlay district that either do not have sidewalks or do not have sidewalks that meet the standards in this article shall include sidewalks as part of the development, according to the following: 
A.  Sidewalks in the downtown overlay district shall be no less than six feet wide. Where possible, sidewalks should be between ten to 12 feet wide so as to allow for two-way pedestrian traffic. 
B.  Where sheets do not contain on street parking that buffers pedestrians from moving traffic, the sidewalk shall be separated from the edge of the finished street by landscaped buffer area, of no less than five feet wide. Such buffer area shall be required in addition to any required sidewalk. Where on street parking exists or is added to the streetscape as part of site development, the sidewalk may immediately abut the finished street edge. 
C.  Enhancements such as landscaping and tree wells, pedestrian amenities and seating, or other streetscape elements may be added within the sidewalk or any landscaped buffer areas, provided all areas of the sidewalk maintain a minimum of five foot clearance for pedestrian movement. 
D.  The city council may grant exceptions to one or more of these standards, either permitting sidewalks of different widths or waiving the requirement to provide sidewalks entirely, in the event it finds all of the following: 
1.  Strict compliance with these standards would lead to: 
a.  An inappropriate design of the right-of-way design and site, according to sound urban design, planning or landscape principals; 
b.  A detriment to general public safety; or 
c.  Excessive construction costs due to extreme and unusual topography or other conditions of the site. 
2.  The inability to meet the standards is due to unique conditions of the site; and 
3.  The degree of exception granted by the city council is the minimum necessary to achieve an appropriate design of both the site and the right-of-way upon which the site fronts, and such that it will not be detrimental to general vehicular and pedestrian transportation patterns along the street and within the district. 
    19B.8 Additional standards for upper story dwellings. 
A.  Upper story dwellings may be permitted as a conditional use upon approval by the city council. The city council may require that any such approval be subject to or upon conditions which, in its discretion, render such use compatible with other uses in the district and with the objectives set forth in any adopted master plan for the downtown area. 
B.  Upper story dwellings shall only be located on the upper stories of a multi-story building and shall not be permitted on any street-level or ground floor. 
C.  The maximum allowable density of upper story dwellings shall be one dwelling unit per 5,000 square feet of land contained in the parcel upon which the use is located. 
D.  The minimum number of Upper Story Dwellings in a building shall be four and the maximum number of upper story dwellings in any one building shall be 16. 
E.  No fewer than two dedicated secure parking spaces per upper story dwelling unit shall be provided and such requirement shall not be modified or reduced by utilizing the shared parking formulas in this Section. Required spaces for visitors or guests may, however, be included in the shared parking formula. 
    19B.9 Additional requirements. 
A.  New construction, redevelopment, expansions and additions. A site plan shall be submitted to the building official in accordance with article IV, section 3.0 and shall contain the following information in addition to that required by such section: the location of any and all drainage facilities, fire hydrant location, exterior lighting, and screening. Other information may be required by the building official to determine compliance with the provisions of this article VI, section 19B. 
B.  Pedestrian passages. The city may require a pedestrian passage between public or shared parking areas and public sidewalks along Main Street and Chalkville Road. Where required, such passage shall not be less than ten feet in width and shall be contained within an casement of adequate width. Where feasible, the easement shall be placed along a side lot line and extend five feet on either side of the lot line. The upper floors of a building may extend over all or a portion of the casement, provided a clear height of ten feet is maintained between the walking surface of the passage and the lowermost portion of the building structure directly above. 
C.  Buffers and screening requirements. Buffers and screens shall be as required by article VII, sections 7.0-7.4. In addition, where abutting a residentially-zoned property, a landscaped buffer of at least ten feet in width shall be provided throughout the length of the shared property line. However, the planning and zoning board may reduce the required width when an opaque wall or fence meeting the requirements of article VII, section 7.1 is provided. 
D.  Streetscape and landscape. Streetscaping and landscaping, where provided, shall be provided in compliance with access and mobility standards and design standards in the downtown master plan and shall further comply with the City of Trussville landscape ordinance. 
E.  Lighting. Exterior lighting, including but not limited to, street lights, exterior fixtures and accent lighting shall be of compatible and complimentary types, designs and specifications to that specified by the city in the downtown master plan and the city's approved downtown lighting standards. 
    19B.10 Nonconformance. Within the downtown overlay district, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use that were lawful before the downtown overlay district ordinance was adopted and that would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue in the downtown overlay district so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A.  No such nonconformity may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
B.  Should such nonconformity be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
C.  Should such nonconformity be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the downtown overlay district. 
D.  Should such nonconformity be abandoned or discontinued for more than one calendar year, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the downtown overlay district. 
E.  Such nonconformity shall not be changed to another nonconforming use, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the downtown overlay district. 
    To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual construction has been carried on diligently and continuously.

A.  Compatibility. The development of the PUD must be compatible with the topography of the parcel, should account for any unusual topographic or natural features of the parcel, must be compatible with adjacent and surrounding property with regard to density, building size, and types of uses, and must not be incompatible with the city's master plan. The city council's determination of compatibility with neighboring properties and whether the proposed PUD is an appropriate use(s) for the particular parcel shall be presumptively correct. The city council may impose such reasonable conditions, terms and limitations which in its sole discretion are necessary and proper for preservation of the character of property in the vicinity and which would make the project compatible with surrounding properties or which are otherwise necessary or helpful for the protection and promotion of the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the city. 
B.  Planning and zoning board consideration. In addition to such other matters which are considered by the planning and zoning board with respect to any other rezoning application, the board may consider the master development plan, the planning criteria, and any supplemental materials in making its decision to recommend approval or denial of an application for the rezoning of a parcel to PUD use. At such hearing before the planning and zoning board suggestions for revisions to the master development plan, planning criteria and supplemental materials may be made, and a written recommendation forwarded to the city council that the application for rezoning be granted based upon the condition that such revisions to the PUD be made. 
C.  City council consideration. In addition to such other matters which are considered by the city council with respect to any other rezoning application, the city council may consider the master development plan, the planning criteria, the PUD application, and any supplemental materials in making its decision to approve or deny an application for the rezoning of a parcel to PUD. The city council may consider the appropriateness of the plan in relation to the physical characteristics of the parcel and to the physical characteristics and uses of properties adjacent to or near the subject parcel, and the city council may require such additions, deletions and changes to the PUD and such agreements and covenants with respect to the proposed development, as the city council deems appropriate. The city council may: 
1.  Approve the PUD, which approval would be evidenced by the signature of the president of the city council; 
2.  Disapprove PUD as submitted; 
3.  Make suggestions for revisions to the PUD and, with the approval of the applicant, continue its consideration of the PUD to a future meeting of the city council; or 
4.  Approve the PUD subject to the applicant making certain specified minor revisions to it, which revisions would be subject to the approval of the zoning officer or building official, and if such revisions are approved by the zoning officer or building official the approval of the plan would be final upon its being signed by the president of the city council. 
An application for rezoning to a PUD may be denied by the city council based upon any one or more of the items of information included in the PUD application, the master development plan, the planning criteria, or any supplemental materials. If the PUD includes uses identified in any land use district as "uses permitted with special approval," the application must describe with specificity and sufficient details so that the city council may determine whether such uses and the development objectives, criteria, design features, specific terms, conditions and limitations related to those uses render the proposed uses compatible with the objectives of the PUD and the area in which the PUD is located. 
    21.7 Building permit. 
A.  General. The developer of the PUD shall proceed with the development of the property in accordance with the plan and in accordance with subdivision approval, and no further approvals shall be required except as set forth herein. Plans for the construction of improvements on any particular parcel within the PUD, shall be submitted, and a building permit shall be approved or disapproved according to the procedure set forth herein and in compliance with applicable building codes. 
B.  Issuance of building permits for principal permitted uses. Upon application for a building permit for the construction of improvements on any parcel within the PUD, the building official shall first determine that the intended use of the improvements is a "principal permitted use" within the applicable land use district of the PUD. A building permit may then be issued in accordance with the provisions of this zoning appendix and in compliance with applicable building codes. 
C.  Issuance of building permits for uses permitted with special approval. Upon application for a building permit for the construction of improvements on any parcel within the PUD, the building official shall first determine that the intended use of the improvements is a use permitted with special approval within the applicable land use district of the PUD. The building official shall refer said applicant and application to the city council for additional consideration as to whether such use may be permitted, as well as any terms and conditions which will be attached thereto in the sole discretion of the city council. 
    21.8 Amendment of the plan. 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this section to provide for the development of the property submitted for the PUD, and to allow minor changes in the plan without any additional approvals. Accordingly, additional approvals shall be required for major changes as defined herein. 
B.  Major change. A "major change" in the plan shall be defined as any change in the boundaries of any land use district reflected on the master development plan, and any change in the planning criteria submitted with the master development plan. No segment, tract, lot or parcel of land within the approved PUD shall be processed for a change of land use district to another PUD land use district or to conventional zoning districts unless the total PUD is submitted along with the rezoning request. The developer of the PUD may request a major change in the plan, by filing an application for amendment which shall be reviewed upon the same basis as the original application. 
C.  Minor change. Any changes to the plan other than those included as "major changes" shall be considered "minor changes." 
D.  Plat approval. Plat approval shall be obtained through the standard plat approval procedures of the City of Trussville. 
    21.9 Time limit for development of plan. If no construction has begun within one year from the estimated and approved start up date of the PUD situated within or outside of the downtown area, as contained within the original approved PUD plan application, the planning and zoning board shall review the plan to assure that conditions in the area have not changed to an extent as to render previously submitted utility, drainage, traffic, and/or other studies as outdated. Outside of the downtown area, development shall commence each year on ten percent of the total PUD or on 50 acres (whichever is less), and said construction should continue and be completed within a reasonable time. Development shall commence on a downtown district or a transitional district PUD within one year of approval, and all construction should continue and be completed within a reasonable time. If development is halted after commencement of construction, or if a change in ownership occurs after commencement of construction, said PUD approval shall remain in full force and effect, and no modification or amendment to the approved plan shall be permitted except as outlined in section 21.8 amendment of the plan. 
    21.10 Effect of changes to zoning ordinance. No amendment or modification of this zoning appendix shall be effective as to any PUD approval issued prior to such amendment or modification, it being intended that the PUD shall continue to be developed in accordance with the zoning appendix in effect at the time of such prior approval.

Buffers and screening shall not impede or divert the flow of water in any drainage way and shall not block access to any aboveground, pad-mounted transformer and shall provide the minimum clear distance required by the utility company. 
3.  Fencing, where installed as part of a buffer or screen, shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and shall comply with the following: 
a.  Fences shall be of finished masonry, durable wood, or a combination thereof. Untreated wood, chain-link, plastic or wire shall not be permitted. No more than 25 percent of the fence surface shall be left open. The finished side of the fence shall face abutting property. 
b.  If a fence is longer than 100 feet in one direction, it shall have columns of wood or masonry, which project outward from the fence surface, and that are spaced no greater than 50 feet on center. 
4.  All screening and buffer plantings shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition by the party or landowner required to provide such plantings and, when necessary, replaced with new plantings. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing removal of junk, debris, dead trees or limbs, abandoned structures, fences, and the like from the buffer area. All fencing shall be permanently maintained in good condition and, whenever necessary, repaired or replaced by the party or landowner required to provide such fence. 
5.  Any existing fences/walls or vegetation and any fences/walls or landscaping used for other purposes, but that are proposed as part of a required buffer or screen, that meet the minimum standards of this section may count toward buffer or screening requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2016-004-PZ, § 8, 2-9-16) 
Sec. 7.2. - Screening design requirements. 
A.  Where required, the design of screening shall be in accord with the following and as approved by the reviewing authority: 
1.  Location on site should be the first consideration in screening. Activities that produce objectionable noise or odors shall be located so as to minimize such impacts to the public and abutting properties. The reviewing authority may lessen screening requirements when the location of the activity to be screened reduces its visibility or other impact to the public and neighboring properties. Activities requiring screening, when co-located, may be screened together. 
2.  The method of screening, including height and materials, shall be that which is sufficient to visually screen the use. 
3.  Shrubs shall be evergreen and spaced no more than five feet on center. If used in combination with a fence, shrubs may be deciduous and may be spaced up to eight feet on center. 
4.  Trees shall be evergreen and, when used in the absence of a fence, should have a low understory and/or be used together with shrubs to provide a continuous, opaque screen 
B.  Screening requirements for specific activities. 
1.  Refuse and recycling containers shall not be located forward of the front building line. Such containers shall be screened by an opaque fence or wall on all sides. Opaque gates, designed to complement the screen, shall be installed for access. The fence or wall shall be at least as tall as the container. 
2.  Mechanical equipment shall be screened so as to not be visible from public streets or adjacent properties. The screening of building- mounted mechanical equipment shall be integral to the building design. Ground level mechanical equipment shall be adequately screened by plant materials and/or fences to blend in with site landscaping. 
3.  Outdoor storage, where permitted, shall be screened to a minimum height of six feet or two feet taller than the material or equipment to be screened, whichever is greater. 
4.  Service areas, loading docks, work yards, and similar areas must be located so as to minimize their visibility to the public. Where their location is insufficient to appropriately minimize such visibility screening shall be at least six feet in height. 
(Ord. No. 2016-004-PZ, § 8, 2-9-16) 
Sec. 7.3. - Modification or waiver of buffer/screening requirements. 
    The buffer requirements of this Article shall be applied equally to all similarly classified and situated properties but may be modified or waived in certain cases where a building site is subject to any of the following circumstances, as determined by the building official: 
A.  Where natural vegetation (trees and/or shrubs) exists on a piece of property at the time application is made for a building permit, a strip of natural vegetation shall be left undisturbed until the Building Official or his designee has inspected such area and evaluated it with regard to the width requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance for that specific use and zone, as well as its suitability. The Building Official or his designee may require that the developer retain a portion of the natural vegetation as a buffer, rather than require a man-made planting strip or other methods of buffering. However, such buffer must be sufficient in both height and density to achieve the desired purpose as a natural barrier. Additional plant materials may be added to existing natural vegetation to achieve this density. 
B.  Where impending development of adjacent property would make these standards unreasonable or impractical. 
C.  Where, after inspection by the building official, it is found that two different and incompatible zone districts abut each other but are already separated by a street or alley, or where the view from the adjoining district is blocked by a change in grade or other natural or manmade features. 
D.  Where a vegetative buffer cannot, in the professional opinion of an expert, be expected to thrive due to soil conditions, intense shade, rock outcroppings, or similar conditions. 
E.  In special cases where a lot was created prior to the adoption of this ordinance in which the side and/or rear yards are inadequate to meet the yard requirements and the buffer strip width requirements as set forth in each respective district, the board of zoning adjustment shall determine, based on site plan review or other pertinent information requested, alternative methods of separation. The Board may in appropriate cases, require some form of natural or manmade buffering be provided in lieu of a greenbelt as a means of separation.

2.  Permit required to place small cell technology facilities in right-of-way. 
(a)  A provider or applicant must obtain a permit from the city before placing, installing, or constructing any small cell technology facility (and associated accessory equipment) on any support structure that is located on the right of way, or substantially modifying the position or characteristics of any such existing facility thereon. 
(b)  The city official will review and administratively process any request for a permit to determine whether, in the exercise of the city official's reasonable discretion, it should be issued for the location and in the manner requested by the applicant. In this process, the burden is on the provider or applicant to demonstrate that the placement of the proposed small cell technology facility and associated accessory equipment or support structure on the right-of-way is the minimal physical installation which will achieve the goal of enhancing the provision of personal wireless services when considering all pertinent factors discussed in the provision immediately below. Except as set forth in this subsection, this permitting process will be administrative and not require the approval of any city board or body other than the city official. 
The factors, requirements and guidelines that the city official may consider and will apply when determining whether to issue a permit for placement of small cell technology facilities and associated structures on the right-of-way include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(i)  The demonstrated need for placing the structures at the requested location and geographic area in order to deliver or enhance personal wireless service; 
(ii)  The visual impact of placing the support structures or facilities in the subject area; 
(iii)  The character of the area in which the structures are requested, including surrounding buildings, properties and uses; 
(iv)  Whether the appearance and placement of the requested structures is aesthetically consistent with the immediate area; 
(v)  Whether the structures are consistent with the historic nature and characteristics of the requested location; 
(vi)  The applicant's or provider's network coverage objective and whether the applicant or provider should use available or previously unconsidered alternative locations to place the support structures or facilities; 
(vii)  Colocation. To the extent practical, all facilities and associated accessory equipment that are placed in the city shall be attached to a pre-existing support structure that is owned, controlled or leased by a utility, franchisee, the city or other entity. If the applicant demonstrates that no colocation opportunities exist in the area where a technologically documented need for a facility exists, the applicant may request that a new pole or other support structure be installed in that area for purposes of constructing the facilities. Before any new support structure is permitted, each of the following must occur: 
(1)  The applicant must have provided the city written evidence that no practical colocation opportunity exists. This evidence shall include, but not be limited to, affidavits, correspondence, or other written information that demonstrates that the applicant has taken all commercially reasonable actions to achieve colocation in the requested location or area, that the applicant has pursued but been denied access to all potential colocation sites in the subject area (and the reasons any such denial(s)), and otherwise show that the Applicant is unable to co-locate on an existing support structure; 
(2)  The city official must recommend the placement of a new support structure in the right-of-way; and 
(3)  The city council must approve the recommendation of the city official to issue a permit that includes the placement of a new support structure in the right-of-way. The city council will consider whether to approve any such new structure at a regular council meeting that will be conducted as soon as practical after the city official's recommendation is made. 
(viii)  If a facility is attached to a utility pole or other support structure in the right-of-way, no antenna or other part of the facility shall extend more than five feet above the height of that structure; provided that, in the event that the applicant demonstrates that National Electric Safety Code regulations or other factors create an undue hardship in complying with this height requirement, the city official may permit a facility to extend up to ten feet above the height of such support structure; 
(ix)  The accessory equipment shall, if reasonably possible, be placed at least ten feet above the ground; 
(x)  The color of antenna and accessory equipment shall be compatible with that of the support structure; 
(xi)  The facility (including the accessory equipment) shall not be illuminated; (xii) whether the proposed installation could cause harm to the public or pose any undue risk to public safety; 
(xiv)  Whether the proposed installation may interfere with vehicular traffic, passage of pedestrians, or other use of the right-of-way by the public; and 
(xv)  If the proposed installation will disturb conditions on the right-of-way, whether the applicant can demonstrate its ability and financial resources to restore the subject area to its pre-existing condition following installation. 
(c)  Application process. 
(i)  At a minimum, each application for a permit shall contain all of the following: 
(1)  Engineering drawings depicting the type of facilities, support structure, and means and points at which such facilities and associated accessory equipment will be attached to a support structure; 
(2)  Map(s) designating with specificity the location(s) of the requested facilities; 
(3)  The geographic coordinates of all antenna and other proposed facilities; 
(4)  If the facilities will be located on a support structure on the right-of-way that is owned by any entity other than the city or the applicant, a copy of any license, lease, agreement or other documentation evidencing that the owner of that support structure authorizes the facilities to be attached thereto or agrees in principle to authorize that attachment; provided that, if a representation is made to the city that the attachment has been authorized in principle by the owner of the support structure but the applicant subsequently fails to furnish the city documentation that finalizes any such agreement, the city may refuse to issue the requested permit until that documentation is provided, or, if the city issues the requested permit before receiving such final documentation, the subject permit may be revoked and any license to use that part of the right-of-way be rescinded. 
(5)  If the applicant requests permission to place facilities on a new support structure, the substantiation therefor required by subsection 2(b)(vii) in this section. 
An application shall not be deemed complete until the applicant has submitted all documents, information, forms and fees specifically enumerated in this section that pertain to the location, construction, or configuration of the facilities or support structures at the requested location(s). Within 30 calendar days after an application for permit is submitted, the city shall notify the applicant in writing if any additional information is needed to complete that application or supplemental information is required to process the request. If the city does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is incomplete within 30 days following its receipt, the application is deemed complete. 
(ii)  Time for processing application. Unless another date is specified in a written agreement between the city and the applicant, the city, will have the following time periods to make its final decision to approve or disapprove an application for a permit contemplated in this ordinance and advise the applicant in writing of that determination: 
(1)  Sixty calendar days from the date an application for a permit is filed with respect to a request to co-locate facilities on an existing support structure; and 
(2)  Ninety calendar days from the date an application for a permit is filed with respect to a request to attach facilities to a new support structure. 
To the extent additional information is required to complete the application after it is filed, the applicable calendar day review period set forth in this subsection shall be tolled and not continue to run until the applicant has provided any missing or requested supplemental information; provided that tolling shall not occur if the city does not advise the applicant in writing of the incompleteness of a submitted application within 30 days after that submission. 
(iii)  Reconsideration/appeal. Any Applicant that desires reconsideration of an administrative decision by the city official to deny a request for a permit to place a facility or support structure on the right-of-way may seek review, modification or reversal of that decision by the city council by submitting a request for reconsideration with the city clerk within 21 calendar days following the city official's decision. That request for reconsideration will be considered by the city council at a regular council meeting that will be conducted as soon as practical after the request for reconsideration is made. If no request for reconsideration is submitted, the decision of the city official will be final. 
Additionally, the applicant, within 30 days following a decision by the city council to deny either (a) a request for reconsideration or (b) a decision by the city council to not approve the placement of a new support structure on the right-of-way, may appeal either of those decisions by the city council to the circuit court of Jefferson County, Alabama. If no appeal of those decisions of the city council is made, those will be deemed final. 
(d)  Additional requirements. Any provider or applicant to whom a permit is issued and that places facilities and associated support structures on the right-of-way also shall comply with the following requirements as long as those facilities and support structures are on or under the right-of-way: 
(i)  Prior to installing the facilities or support structures, the applicant shall provide the city a certificate(s) of insurance evidencing that it has obtained and will maintain the following types of insurance in connection with its operations on or use of the right-of-way: (1) general liability coverage insuring the risk of claims for damages to persons or property arising from or related to the installation, construction, maintenance, operation or any use of facility or support structure placed on or along the right of way by the applicant (or any of their contractors) with minimum limits of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence; and (2) workers compensation insurance as required by statute. The general liability coverage shall list the city as an additional insured, and may be provided through a combination of a primary and umbrella policies. All insurance policies shall be furnished by insurers who are reasonable acceptable to the city and authorized to transact business in the State of Alabama. On an annual basis following initial installation, the applicant also shall furnish the city a certificate indicating that the above-noted coverage remains and will remain in effect.

If those support structures should fail at any time to comply with applicable laws and regulations, the provider or applicant, at either of their expense, shall cause those structures to be brought into compliance with said laws and regulations within 15 days of the date of any written notice to them from the city official of noncompliance, or cease all personal wireless service operations related to those structures until the applicant or provider comes into full compliance with said laws and regulations. 
(iv)  The facilities and associated support structures must at all times be maintained in good and safe condition. On no more frequent than a triennial basis, the city official may request that the provider or applicant, at either of their expense, furnish certification from a professional engineer who is licensed in the State of Alabama that the facilities and support structures are in sound condition. Should that engineer deem those structures unsound, the provider or applicant shall furnish to the city official a plan to remedy any unsafe conditions or structural defect(s) and take that remedial action at the provider or applicant's expense. 
(v)  Each applicant or provider that applies for a permit to place facilities (including the accessory equipment) and support structures on the right-of-way and installs and utilizes those structures shall defend, indemnity and hold the city and its employees or officials, harmless from all demands, losses, expenses (including attorney's fees and court costs), claims for personal injury or property damage, judgments or liabilities of any type that may be asserted or claimed against the city (or its employees or officials) by any third person, firm or entity that arise out of or relate in any manner to the following: (1) the installation, construction, maintenance, use or operation of the permitted Facilities, accessory equipment or any support structure on or about the right-of-way; and (2) the failure of the provider or applicant to perform any of their respective responsibilities, obligations and permit requirements in this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provider or applicant shall not be obligated to indemnify the city for city claims resulting from the sole negligence or willful acts of the city (or its representatives). 
(e)  Permit and license fees. The applicant for a permit to place facilities and associated support structures on the right-of-way shall pay the following types of fees that are enumerated in [this section] of the City Code, as amended: 
(i)  A permit application and review fee to be paid when an application is submitted; 
(ii)  A permit issuance fee per each support structure on the right-of-way contemplated for attachment; and 
(iii)  An annual license fee per each support structure on the right-of-way pertaining to the ongoing use of public property. 
(f)  Franchise agreements for other uses of right-of-way. This subsection 2. regulates the placement of small cell technology facilities (and associated accessory equipment) on or in the immediate vicinity of support structures that are located or proposed to be located on the right-of-way. No provision in this subsection 2. or elsewhere in this section is intended to permit, regulate or authorize the placement by a provider or applicant of fiber optic lines, coaxial cable, switches, pedestals or networking equipment of any type that is used to transport telecommunication signals, data or messages between support structures or between any other points on the right-of-way. In the event any such provider or applicant desires to place telecommunications equipment or facilities along the right-of-way at points not regulated by this section, the city may enter into franchise or similar agreement that authorize, govern and apply to such use of other locations on or along the right-of-way. 
3.  Placement of small cell technology facilities on private property. 
(a)  A provider or applicant must obtain a permit from the city before placing, installing, or constructing any small cell technology facility (and associated accessory equipment) on any support structure that is located on private property, or substantially modifying the position or characteristics of any such existing facility thereon. 
(b)  The city official will review and administratively process any request for a permit to determine whether, in the exercise of the city official's reasonable discretion, it should be issued for the location and in the manner requested. In this process, the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the placement of the proposed small cell technology facility and associated accessory equipment or support structure on private property is the minimal physical installation which will achieve the technological goal of enhancing the provision of personal wireless services. Except as set forth in this subsection, this permitting process will be administrative and not require the approval of any city board or body other than the city official. 
The factors, guidelines and requirements that the city official may consider and will apply when determining whether to issue a permit for placement of facilities and any associated accessory equipment or support structure on private property include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1)  City council approval to install a new support structure on private property is not a condition for a permit to place facilities thereon; and 
(2)  If the facilities are located on private property that is not owned or exclusively used by the applicant, instead of providing the documentation contemplated in subsection 2(c)(i)(4), the applicant shall present a license, lease, agreement or other documentation indicating that owner of said property authorizes the applicant the rights to place the facilities thereon and access thereto, or that such owner agrees in principle to grant the applicant those rights; provided that, if a representation is made to the city that the owner of private property has agreed in principle to grant those rights but the applicant subsequently fails to furnish the city documentation that finalizes any such agreement, the city may refuse to issue the requested permit until that documentation is provided, or, if the city issues the requested permit before receiving such final documentation, the subject permit and license may be revoked.

For purposes of this provision, "good cause" shall mean circumstances have arisen that indicate the facilities and associated support structures have been damaged, are not functioning in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or otherwise pose a hazard to the public. If those structures fail at any time to comply with said laws and regulations, the provider or applicant shall cause those structures to be brought into compliance with said laws and regulations within 15 days of the date of any written notice to either of them of such noncompliance, or cease all personal wireless communications operations related to those structures until the provider or applicant comes into full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

If a provider or applicant abandons any facility (including the accessory equipment) or an associated support structure (collectively "facilities" for purposes of this subsection) that is located on the right-of-way, the following rights and obligations shall exist. The city may require the provider or applicant, at their expense, to remove and reclaim the abandoned facilities within 60 days from the date of written notice of abandonment given by the city to them and to reasonably restore the condition of the property at which the facilities are located to that existing before they were installed. If the provider or applicant fails to remove and reclaim its abandoned facilities within such 60-day period and the facilities are located on the right-of-way, the city shall have the rights to (a) remove them and charge its expense of any such removal operation to the account of the provider or applicant, (b) purchase all abandoned facilities at the subject location from the provider or applicant in consideration for $1.00, (c) at the city's discretion, either resell the abandoned facilities to a third party or dispose and salvage them; provided that the proceeds of any resale of abandoned facilities by the city to a third party shall be credited to the account of the applicant or provider that used those facilities before the abandonment, and (d) charge any expense incurred by the city to restore the right-of-way to the account of the provider or applicant. 
5.  Co-Location. To promote the public interest that is served by co-locating facilities and associated accessory equipment on existing support structures and thereby mitigating the installation of additional support structures throughout the city, no person or entity (including any provider, applicant, utility, or franchisee) that utilizes an existing support structure that is located on right-of-way or on private property in the city and has space available thereon may deny a provider or applicant the right to use or access an existing support structure for purposes of attaching facilities permitted by this section without sound operational, technological or other good reason.

ARTICLE IX. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 1.0. - Purpose of off-street parking and loading requirements. 
    The primary purpose of these provisions is to reduce traffic congestion on public streets of the city by requiring certain minimum off-street parking and loading areas be provided. Further, these provisions promote safe and convenient access to and from each site, as well as safe and efficient on-site traffic circulation and encourage the design of attractive, efficient and harmonious facilities. 
    At the time of the erection of any building or at the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding floor area, seats, dwelling units, guest rooms, or before conversion from one type of use or occupancy to another, permanent off-street parking in the amount specified by this article must be provided. Such parking space may be provided in a parking garage or parking lot or in driveways serving single and two-family residences. Parking facilities provided in accordance with the terms of this article shall not subsequently be reduced to below the requirements of this article. 
A.  All residential and agricultural zoning districts in the City of Trussville require a minimum of two off-street parking spaces. However, provisions shall be made by the owner or occupant of each residential or agricultural unit to park all vehicles belonging to residents of the household within the confines their property and not upon the public right-of-way. Recreational vehicles and commercial vehicles shall not be parked forward of the front of a residence, nor shall recreational vehicles and commercial vehicles be parked on the right-of-way in residential districts or in agriculturally zoned districts that are developed residentially. In the case of corner lots or double fronted lots, recreational and commercial vehicles must be screened or shielded from public view as set out in article VII, section 7.0. 
B.  All commercial, industrial, and institutional zoning districts in the city have parking requirements determined by the use, occupancy, size and/or seating capacity of the site. All required parking shall be contained within the confines of the site or may be supplemented by a written, fully executed document authorizing shared parking between the business owner and the owner of nearby property having surplus parking places above those required for the use on the site, or when the hours of operation of the two uses allow peak use of the parking spaces at separate times of day.

C.  [Miscellaneous.] The parking space requirement for a use which is not specifically mentioned in this article shall be the same as required for a use of similar nature. 
D.  [Fractional spaces.] Where fractional spaces result in using the formulas contained in this section, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. 
E.  [Mixed or joint uses.] In the case of mixed or joint uses, the parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately, except as otherwise specifically provided in [article] VI, section 19B, Downtown Overlay district. 
F.  [Applications.] These standards shall apply fully to all uses and buildings established after the effective date of this article. 
G.  [Additions, expansions, etc.] These standards shall apply to all additions, expansions, enlargements or reconstruction on the basis of the addition, expansion, enlargement or reconstruction only. 
H.  [Publicly owned recreation facilities.] Off-street parking areas and spaces serving publicly owned recreation facilities may have a surface other than bituminous pavement or concrete, subject to approval of the engineering and inspections department. 
I.  Certification of minimum parking requirements. Each application for an occupancy approval shall include information as to the location and dimensions of off-street parking spaces, if required, and the means of ingress and egress between such space and a street or alley. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the engineering and inspections department to determine whether or not the requirements are met. The occupancy approval for the use of any building, structure or land where off-street parking space is required shall be withheld by the engineering and inspections department until the provisions are fully met. 
    3.1. Location and design of off-street parking areas. 
A.  In all residential districts required off-street parking shall be provided on the same lot as the use to which the parking pertains. In other districts, such parking may be provided either on the same lot or an adjacent lot, not in a residential district, when an increase in the number of spaces is required by a change of use or enlargement of the building served, or where such spaces are provided collectively or used jointly by two or more buildings or establishments. 
B.  Up to 50 percent of the parking spaces required for (a) theaters, restaurants, public auditoriums, and bowling alleys, and up to one hundred percent of the parking spaces required for a church auditorium may be provided and used jointly by (b) establishments not normally open, used or operated during the same hours as those listed in (a); provided, however, that written agreement thereto is properly executed and filed as specified below. 
C.  In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, a written, notarized agreement thereby assuring their retention for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, and shall be filed with the application for a building permit or business license. 
D.  All parking areas shall be provided with safe entrance to and exit from the public thoroughfare. The location of such entrances and exits, and design and construction thereof, shall be reviewed in the interest of safety, adequate drainage and other public concerns. 
E.  All parking areas (except in single-family residential) utilized between dusk and dawn shall be properly illuminated. All lighting fixtures used to illuminate parking areas shall not direct lights on adjoining rights-of-way or properties.

Parking areas for all developments shall be so designed that sanitation, emergency and other public service vehicles can adequately and safely serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous maneuvers. Fire lanes may be required by the fire chief or fire marshal.

J.  Drainage in parking areas shall direct stormwater back into the site and away from adjacent properties toward adequate drainage channels. Large parking areas of 20 or more spaces shall provide on-site stormwater detention to retard the sudden discharge of high volumes of stormwater into the public drainage system. Within the downtown overlay district, low-impact development techniques for stormwater management, including, but not limited to, pervious paving systems, rain gardens and swales may be used toward this requirement and are encouraged. The quantity and rate of runoff after development shall not exceed the quantity and rate of runoff before development, based on a 25-year storm frequency. Drainage plans shall be subject to approval by building official. 
    3.2. Parking prohibitions.

B.  Commercial operations shall not be conducted from parking lots without special approval from the city council. 
C.  The use of any required parking space for the storage of any motor vehicle for sale, repair, or any other purpose other than the temporary parking of motor vehicles while patronizing the use to which the parking is authorized, is prohibited. Overnight parking of vehicles not related to the use on the property, shall not be allowed. 
D.  The keeping of an inoperative motor vehicle shall be within a fully enclosed building or structure or be completely screened or shielded from public view. Moreover, no inoperative motor vehicle shall be parked on any public street. 
E.  No vehicle exceeding 7,500 pounds gross weight and no boats, trailers, commercial vehicles, recreational vehicles, campers and/or similar equipment regardless of weight, shall be kept within a residential district unless such vehicle is parked behind the front building line. In no instance shall a camper or recreational vehicle be connected to power, water, or sanitary facilities or used as a residence in a residential district. 
    3.3 Access controls. 
A.  Property which has frontage on two or more streets may be allowed entrances on each street, subject to review and approval by the engineering and inspections department and the street department. 
B.  Installation of turn lanes, pavement widening, or other appropriate modifications may be required if deemed necessary by the engineering and inspections department and the street department. 
C.  Each parking area on a lot shall be physically separated from an adjoining street right-of-way by a curb or equivalent barrier to control vehicular access to and from the lot. Such barrier shall be located at or along the front line, unless suitable barriers are located within the street right-of-way. Except for permitted accessways, such barriers shall be continuous. 
(Ord. No. 2016-004-PZ, § 10, 2-9-16) 
Sec. 4.0. - Loading area requirements. 
    4.1 Required loading space. 
A.  On the same premises with every building or structure involving the receipt or dispatch of vehicles as a necessity for, or as incidental to, the operation or use of the building, an area shall be set out for loading and unloading services, in order to avoid undue interference with public use of streets or alleys. 
B.  Each such space shall be a minimum of 14 feet wide and 40 feet long where vans are to be received, or a minimum of 14 feet wide and 60 feet long where tractors and semitrailers are to be received.

E.  All lighting fixtures used to illuminate loading areas shall not direct light on adjacent streets or properties and shall not exceed a height of 25 feet above ground level. 
F.  All required loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the principal use served by the spaces, unless a satellite or joint use loading facility is secured in an equivalent manner as satellite or joint parking facilities, as provided by subsections 3.1B. and C. of this article. 
    4.2 Loading area site arrangement. All loading areas shall be provided with safe entrance to and exit from the public thoroughfare. The engineering and inspections department and street department shall approve the design and construction of loading areas in the interests of safety, adequate drainage and other public requirements. 
Sec. 5.0. - Change in parking and loading requirements.

    Petitions as described in section 2.0 for proposed changes of the zoning district boundaries or of the zoning regulations may be initiated by the city council, the planning and zoning board, or by petition of property owners or their agents. 
    When a rezoning request is made by the property owner or his authorized agent, the following procedure shall be followed: 
    4.1 Application filing procedure. 
A.  The application for rezoning shall be made on a form available from the city clerk's office.

C.  The application shall be submitted to the city clerk at least 21 days prior to the planning and zoning board's regularly scheduled meeting. A rezoning fee of $100.00 is required at the time of filing the application for change. 
    4.2 Public hearing by the planning and zoning board. After the application for change has been properly filed with the city and the required fee paid, the following procedure shall apply: 
A.  At least 15 days prior to the planning and zoning board meeting at which the rezoning request is to be presented and initially considered, the city clerk or his/her duly authorized representative shall give, or cause to be given, written notice to all property owners located in whole or in part within 500 feet of the boundaries of the subject property as shown by the official records of the county tax assessor, on a date not more than one year prior to the date of such notice. This notice shall state:

NOTE: The municipal governing body (city council) is not bound by the recommendations of the planning and zoning board, nor is it even necessary for the planning and zoning board to make any specific recommendations for or against adoption. The law merely requires consideration and a report by the planning and zoning board on zoning measures before the municipal governing body has power to enact them. 
Once the governing body receives the report of the planning and zoning board, the responsibility shifts to the governing body to follow the procedures set out at Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-77, as amended. 
Sec. 5.0. - Public hearing by the city council. 
A.  Upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning board, the city council shall give a "first reading" of the proposed amendment at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting after notice and set same for a public hearing. 
B.  Following proper notification of adjoining property owners as enunciated in subsection 4.2, the city shall publish the proposed request in full for one insertion in a newspaper of general circulation published within the city, not less than 15 days in advance of such hearing, together with a notice stating the time and place that the ordinance is to be considered by the municipal governing body and stating further that at such time and place all persons who desire shall have an opportunity of being heard in opposition to or in favor of such ordinance, one week after the first insertion, the municipal governing body shall have published a synopsis of the proposed ordinance, which synopsis shall refer to the date and name of the newspaper in which the proposed ordinance was first published. Both such insertions shall be published at least 15 days in advance of the passage of the ordinance. If there is no newspaper, then the governing body must cause the ordinance and the notice to be posted in four conspicuous places within the municipality. 
C.  After such hearing by the municipal governing body (city council), the ordinance may be adopted as reported by the planning and zoning board or in such amended form as it deems best in its discretion. However, if the city council makes substantial changes in the ordinance which it first advertised or posted, whichever is applicable, the city council should hold another public hearing after giving notice as required. 
D.  After adoption of the ordinance by the city council, it must again be published in the same manner as are all municipal ordinances according to the provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-45-8, as amended. 
Sec. 6.0. - Zoning amendments by the city. 
    The planning and zoning board and/or city council, may upon its own initiative, begin the process of rezoning property and/or other zoning amendments. They may upon their own initiative, hold public hearings for the consideration of any proposed amendment to the provisions of this article after notice thereof is given in accordance with the provisions of this article, relative to aforementioned procedures for notification, advertisement or posting, hearings, and adoption. 
    The regulations and the number, area, and boundaries or districts established by this ordinance may be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed by the City Council of the City of Trussville, but no amendment shall become effective unless it is first submitted to the Trussville Planning and Zoning Board. At its own initiative this body may hold public hearings, public notice of which shall be given, for the consideration of any proposed amendment to the provisions of this appendix or to the Zoning Map of Trussville, and report its recommendations to the City Council of Trussville. The provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 11-52-74 and 11-52-77 or as same may be amended shall apply to all changes and amendments. 
Sec. 7.0. - Limit on rezoning requests. 
    If the proposal is rejected by the planning and zoning board, the decision may be appealed to the city council. Should the city council then deny the appeal, the same kind of rezoning of the same tract or parcel of land will not be considered by the planning and zoning board until a period of one year has elapsed from the date of such action by the city council. Further, a withdrawal of the application for rezoning after the hearings held by the planning and zoning board, but prior to the hearing held by the city council shall also require a one-year time period before another application on the same request may be submitted. However, the planning and zoning board may adjust this time period if in the opinion of a majority of the board, an unusual situation or circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing or if a different proposal is made on the property. Each time the rezoning amendment application is made, the required administration fee must be paid, and under no condition shall said sum or any part thereof be refunded for failure of such proposal or amendment to be enacted into law.

E.  To protect the safety and welfare of the public by minimizing the hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
F.  To differentiate among those signs that, because of their location, may distract drivers on public streets and those that may provide information to them while they remain in their cars but out of active traffic; 
G.  To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; 
H.  To prohibit most signs with commercial messages in residential zoning districts, while allowing those commercial messages that relate to commercial activities lawfully conducted on individual properties within such districts; 
I.  To provide broadly for the expression of individual opinions through the use of signs on private property; 
J.  To prohibit new billboards in the city.

A.  Prohibited. No new billboards shall be allowed in the city after October 15, 2006. 
B.  Construction of this section and related definition. Any person aggrieved by a determination of a city official that a particular sign is or is not a billboard shall have the right to appeal such decision to the zoning board of adjustment, which shall resolve the appeal in accordance with the principles of this subsection: 
1.  If, because of its size, height or location, such sign would be allowed only if it is found to be a "billboard," this section and the definition shall be strictly construed, and the burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show that the proposed sign is a billboard and thus should be permitted; 
2.  If the sign conforms with applicable height, size, and location requirements for signs other than billboards and a permit has been denied only because it has been found to be a billboard by reason of the off-premises nature of the message to be displayed, this section and the definition shall be liberally construed. If the applicant asserts that the sign will be used only for lawful messages, including noncommercial messages, the board may reverse the denial of the permit and grant the permit subject to the express condition that, if the sign is ever used for an off-premises commercial message, it shall be considered an illegal sign and shall be subject to removal in accordance with section 31.0. 
(Ord. No. 2006-046-PZ, 10-10-04)

F.  No more than one portable/temporary sign shall be permitted at any one time for a single establishment. 
G.  A temporary sign may be mounted on a wall.

A temporary sign may bear any other message, including a message offering the premises for sale or lease, promoting a civic or other noncommercial activity or event, or expressing the opinion of the person placing the sign on any matter. 
L.  In the nonresidential zoning districts, during the time that a property is under development or construction, one temporary detached development sign that conforms in size, height and location with the standards for permanent signs shall be allowed. Such temporary sign shall be removed upon the earlier of the following: 60 days after issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the premises; or installation of the permanent sign. Because this sign is allowed in lieu of a permanent sign and cannot be displayed at the same time as a permanent sign, this sign is separate from other temporary signs allowed under this section and is not subject to the time or size limits imposed on other temporary signs.

This section sets out specific criteria for review and incentives for compliance. Consideration of design issues necessarily requires some exercise of judgment within the specific criteria set out in this section, but decisions rendered by utilizing these review criteria shall be objective rather than arbitrary or capricious. 
B.  Applicability. Owners of any of the following may apply for approval of a master signage plan for their respective properties in business, commercial or industrial zoning districts: 
1.  An applicant for approval of a site development plan, drainage plan, parking plan or other plan for the physical layout of a site.

If it is incomplete, it shall be returned to the applicant with a specific list of the items that are incomplete. 
3.  The planning and zoning board shall act on the master signage plan at the meeting at which it is first considered. If the board fails to act at such meeting, the plan shall be deemed to have been denied, unless the applicant has consented to a delay in the decision. 
4.  If a master signage plan application is denied, the applicant may submit a new application with a revised plan at any time. 
5.  Any person aggrieved by the action of the planning and zoning board or the building official on a master signage plan may appeal the decision by filing an appeal with the board of zoning adjustment. 
D.  Application contents. The application for approval of a master signage plan shall contain at least the following information. Where the application is submitted simultaneously with an application for development plan approval or where there is an approved development plan for the area for which the application for a master signage plan is filed, the master signage plan may refer to portions of the development plan application or approved development plan for related requirements: 
1.  An accurate plot plan of the development site, at such scale as the building official may reasonably require; 
2.  A proposed design plan showing signage design at a scale of missing text? = 1 ft; 
3.  Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas on such development site;

F.  Provisions for nonconforming signs. A master signage plan for a property already containing signs on the date of submission of the application shall include a schedule for bringing all signs on the development site into conformance with the master signage plan by a specified date. The conformance schedule included in such master signage plan shall be considered a condition of approval of the master signage plan.

The initial step is the preparation and submission to the planning commission of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. The second step is the preparation and submission to the planning commission of a final plat, together with required certificates. This final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the probate judge, when duly signed by the chairman of the planning commission and the mayor of Trussville, Alabama. 
Sec. 2. - Preapplication. 
    The subdivider is encouraged to consult early and informally with the planning commission to obtain advice and assistance before he begins to prepare the preliminary plat. This will enable him to become familiar with the major street plan and other official plans and municipal ordinances which might affect the area. 
Sec. 3. - Preliminary plat approval. 
    The application for preliminary plat approval, including eight prints of the subdivision plan, shall be submitted to the planning commission at least ten days prior to the planning commission's regularly scheduled meeting. A fee of $25.00 plus $1.00 per lot proposed on the preliminary plat shall be required. [The] Fee [shall be] payable at [the] time of submission. 
    The planning commission before its review, shall transmit prints of the preliminary plat to the gas department, street department, fire department, building inspector, and any other city or county department for review and recommendations in relation to specific service problems. 
    Prior to approval of the preliminary plat, the planning commission shall afford a public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be sent to all adjoining land owners as their names appear upon the plats in the Jefferson County tax assessor's office. Notice of the public hearing shall be sent at least five days prior to the date of the hearing. 
    The preliminary plat, which shall meet the minimum standards of design and the general requirements for the construction of public improvements set forth in these regulations, shall give the following information:

    1.2 All thoroughfares in the major street plan shown crossing or bordering a proposed subdivision are required to be provided for in the location and at the right-of-way width designated on the major street plan. 
    1.3 To ensure development of the community in substantial conformity with the general principles set forth in the official plans and maps of the City of Trussville, the planning commission may require that the subdivider reserve open spaces for parks, schools, fire stations, playgrounds, and any other use essential to the welfare of the community. However, no more than ten percent of the total subdivision may be required by donation. If additional area over ten percent of a proposed subdivision is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the community, the additional area shall be offered for sale to the city at its fair market value. Such offer shall extend for a period of not less than 90 days from the date of receipt by the city of such written offer. 
    1.4 Clearly noted on the preliminary plat should be all the improvements the owner proposes to make pursuant to the development of the subdivision. These improvements shall relate to drainage, utilities, and other improvements necessary to permit development of the subdivision. Also, clearly noted on the preliminary plat should be all the improvements the owner proposes to request the City of Trussville to make, relative to off-premises improvements necessary to the development of the subdivision. These improvements shall relate to drainage improvements necessary to carry runoff to a major drainage channel, and also all extensions of water mains, sewers, and other utility extensions. 
Sec. 2. - Street plan. 
    2.1 General. 
    The arrangement, character, extent, location, and grade of all streets shall be laid out according to good land planning principles and shall be integrated with all existing and planned streets. New streets shall consider topographical conditions, orientation to vistas, public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of land to be served by them. 
    The proposed street system shall also be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. However, the number of streets converging upon any one point which would tend to promote congestion shall be held to a minimum. Creation of multiple street intersections shall not be permitted. The street pattern shall be in conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire neighboring area. 
    Sufficient proposed streets shall be provided to create normal circulation of traffic within the vicinity.

(b)  Alleys are not permitted in residential districts, except when the planning commission determines special conditions warrant a secondary means of access. 
    2.13 Names. 
(a)  No street name shall be used which will duplicate by spelling or sound or otherwise be confused with the name of existing streets. Street names are subject to the approval of the planning commission and building inspector. 
(b)  Subdivision names and apartment project names shall not duplicate or be confused with existing names. Subdivision and apartment project names are subject to approval by the planning commission. 
    2.14 See appendix B [in art. XIII] for subdivision minimum standards. 
Sec. 3. - Blocks. 
    The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(a)  Provisions of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
(b)  Zoning ordinance and health department requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; 
(c)  Needs for convenient access, circulations, control, and safety of street traffic; and 
(d)  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
    Block lengths shall not be less than 400 nor more than 1,200 feet and shall normally be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. 
    Pedestrian crosswalks not less than ten feet wide may be required where deemed essential in blocks over 800 feet long by the planning commission to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, bus stops, and other community facilities. 
Sec. 4. - Lots. 
    4.1 The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation, and the minimum building setback line shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. 
    4.2 Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance and the requirements of the county health department. In cases where requirements conflict, the greater requirement shall govern. 
    4.3 Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking and loading for the use contemplated. 
    4.4 Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra 15-foot width to permit appropriate building orientation and setback from both streets.

    5.2 Where a subdivision is traversed by an existing or proposed watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such existing or planned drainageway. The width of such drainage easement or right-of-way shall be sufficient to contain the ultimate channel and maintenance way for the tributary area upstream. 
    5.3 Lots and easements shall be arranged in such a manner as to eliminate unnecessary easement jogs or off-sets, and to facilitate the use of easements for power distribution, telephone service, drainage, water, and sewer services. 
Sec. 6. - Drainage and inundation. 
    A drainage plan shall be made for each subdivision by the owner's engineer, which plan shall take into consideration the ultimate or saturated development of the tributary area in which the proposed subdivision is located. Adequate provisions shall be made to provide drainage easements needed within the subdivision, taking into consideration the saturated development of the tributary area. 
    The storm and sanitary sewer plans shall be worked out prior to the development of the other utility plans. Engineering considerations shall give preferential treatment to these gravity flow improvements, as opposed to other utilities and improvements. Off-premises drainage easements and improvements may be required to handle the runoff of subdivisions into a natural drainage channel. But under no condition shall storm drainage be emptied into the sanitary sewer system, or vice versa. 
    Low areas subject to periodic inundation shall not be developed or subdivided unless and until the planning commission establishes that:

ARTICLE IX. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 1. - Hardship. 
    Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships may result from strict compliance with these regulations due to unusual topographic or other conditions beyond the control of the subdivider, it may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided, however, that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying the intent or purpose of the subdivision regulations, zoning ordinance, major street plan, or other elements of the Trussville Comprehensive Plan. Any variance thus authorized is required to be entered in writing in the minutes of the planning commission and the reason which justified the departure to be set forth. (See article III, section 2.17 for definition.)

The municipal corporation may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by action for injunction brought in any court of equity jurisdiction or may recover the same penalty by a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
ARTICLE XI. - [SEVERABILITY] 
    Should any article, section, subsection, or provision of these subdivision regulations be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of the subdivision regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be invalid or unconstitutional.
