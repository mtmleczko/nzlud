PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through January 4, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of the editorial staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Robert Tolson, Jr., City Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-72. - Unlawful harassment prohibited. 
(a)  The city expressly prohibits its officials or employees from engaging in any form of unlawful harassment of employees based on race, religion, color, gender, national origin, disability or status as a veteran or special disabled veteran. 
(b)  (1)  Harassment is any annoying, persistent act or actions, deliberately done, that singles out an employee, over that employee's objection to his or her detriment, because of race, sex, religion, national origin, age (over forty (40)) or disability. Harassment may include, but is not limited to, the following actions: 
a.  Verbal abuse or ridicule, such as offensive verbal comments about an individual's appearance, sexually degrading words to describe an individual, words, jokes or comments based upon an individual's race, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran's status or ethnicity; 
b.  Interference with an employee's work or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; 
c.  Displaying or distributing sexually offensive, racist or other derogatory materials;

g.  Demanding favors (sexual or otherwise), explicitly, as a condition of employment, promotion, transfer or any other term or condition of employment. 
(2)  No employee, supervisor, department head, or official shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that he or she has the right or authority to offer any benefits, including, but not limited to, tangible items, whether business-related, such as raises or promotions, or nonbusiness-related, such as gifts, trips, or any other item, in exchange for sexual favors, nor does any employee, supervisor, department head or official possess such authority. An employee receiving such an offer should immediately report it to the department head, or if the accused is the department head, the personnel director. 
(c)  It is every employee's and official's responsibility to ensure that his or her conduct does not include or imply harassment in any form. If, however, harassment or suspected harassment has or is taking place: 
(1)  An employee should report harassment immediately to the department head. If the department head is the alleged harasser or if the complainant reasonably believes that complaints made to the department head will be unavailing, then the complaint should be reported to the personnel director. Complaints should be made in writing. 
(2)  Any employee who has knowledge of harassment she shall inform the department head, or if the department head is the alleged harasser or the employee reasonably believes that reporting the conduct to the department head will be unavailing, then inform the personnel director, in writing. Department heads shall actively monitor workplace conduct for potential harassment. All city employees have a duty to report suspected harassment in the workplace. 
(3)  Each complaint shall be fully investigated. The complainant, accused, and witnesses identified by both, including, where necessary, former employees, shall be interviewed. A determination of the facts and appropriate action will be made on a case-by-case basis. Investigations will be conducted in an impartial and objective manner. Investigations of officials will be performed by the Internal Affairs Division of the Pine Bluff Police Department, or, where that is impractical or objected to by either the complainant or the accused party, by an independent party or agency not a part of city government. The investigative findings and recommendations shall be reduced to writing and provided to the complainant, accused party, mayor and personnel director. To the extent allowable by law, confidentiality will be maintained during the investigation process. 
All city employees have an affirmative duty to cooperate in the investigation of complaints. Failure or refusal to cooperate in an investigation shall subject an employee to disciplinary action, including termination. 
(d)  The city will not tolerate harassment or any form of retaliation against an employee who has either instigated or cooperated in the investigation of alleged harassment. Disciplinary action, including termination, will be taken against offenders who are employees; officials may be subject to censure by the city council. 
(e)  Department heads and supervisors for the city shall undergo periodic training in the detection, investigation, and prevention of unlawful harassment in the workplace. Certificates of such training shall be maintained by the personnel director.

n.  Employee benefit plan consultant services. 
(3)  The city council may add, by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote, any other appropriate service that the city council may from time to time designate to be a professional service because "cost" or "price bidding" is found to be impractical, unfeasible, or, if based solely upon price, would result in an outcome that would not meet the best interests of the city. 
(b)  It is the policy of the city to publicly announce all requirements for the competitive selection of professional services as referenced above, and to negotiate contracts for such services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services required provided that the services are rendered at fair and reasonable prices. 
(c)  All municipal boards, commissions, and authorities established pursuant to state statute or other legislative authority shall be responsible for the implementation of such policies and procedures as are hereinafter compiled. 
(d)  The competitive selection for such services shall be conducted by a review committee which has been selected by the appropriate governing board, commission or authority as the case may be, which may include appropriate city personnel and professionals, and/or individuals with community expertise based on the nature of the services to be selected. The review committee for each proposed contract, may establish the qualifications and evaluation criteria necessary for the specific services to be provided. 
(e)  The department head or manager for the relevant board, commission or authority will cause to be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation a notice that the city has a need to contract for a particular professional service and shall invite all interested parties to submit within ten (10) days, to the extent permitted by the ethical standards of the profession, a statement of their qualifications and other relevant information based on the evaluation criteria specifically developed for the proposed services to be provided. 
    Whenever state law or city ordinance requires that the city use competitive bidding or request for proposals for the purchase of items or for professional or other services, the city department or agency must, in addition to publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area, also cause to be posted on the city's local cable television access channel and on the city's internet web site the same or substantially similar notice of the bid or request for proposal as published in the newspaper. The notice posted on the television channel and on the city's internet web site shall be maintained for the entire period that the bid or request for proposals may be submitted. 
(f)  The review committee shall evaluate all statements of qualifications and other submittals and may conduct interviews with up to five (5) firms regarding anticipated concepts and the relative utility of alternative methods of approach for furnishing the required services and then shall select therefrom, in order of preference, based on criteria established and published by the review committee, no less than three (3) of the firms deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. 
(g)  The review committee or its designee shall then negotiate a contract with the highest qualified firm for the services to be rendered, at compensation which the review committee, or its designee, determines is fair and reasonable to the city, subject to the approval of the governing board, commission or authority as referred to in subsection (c) of this section.

(3)  In its deliberations under this division, said HDC shall not consider interior arrangement or use.

(Ord. No. 6188, § 5, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 6607, § 1, 8-20-18) 
Sec. 2-356. - Determination on an application. 
    Within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days after the filing of an application for a certificate of appropriateness with the HDC administrator, the HDC shall make a preliminary determination as to the properties, if any that will be materially affected by any of the changes proposed in said application. The HDC shall promptly send by mail, postage prepaid, to the applicant and to the owners of all such affected properties, a notice of hearing to be held by the HDC on said application. A notice of the public hearing shall be published at least one (1) time in a newspaper having circulation throughout the City of Pine Bluff a minimum of fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. 
(1)  The HDC, at the public hearing, shall hear all persons desiring to present information regarding the application. The HDC shall act on such application for certificate of appropriateness within a reasonable period of time. The HDC shall determine whether the restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, preservation, alteration, construction, moving or demolition of buildings, structures, or appurtenant fixtures involved will be appropriate to the preservation of the historic district. If the HDC determines that a certificate of appropriateness should not be issued, it shall place upon its records the reasons for such determination. The HDC shall immediately notify the applicant of its determination. 
(2)  Proposed repairs, alterations, new construction, moving or demolition in the historic district shall respect and relate to the special character of the district. In making its determination, the HDC shall consider without being limited to the following criteria: 
a.  The purpose of this division; 
b.  The architectural or historic value or significance of a building and its relationship to the surrounding area; 
c.  The general compatibility of proposed changes; and 
d.  Any other factor, including visual and aesthetic, considered pertinent. 
(3)  The HDC shall encourage proposed changes which reflect the original design of the structure, based on photographs, written description or other historical documentation, and shall be guided by the following preferences: 
a.  It is preferable to preserve by maintenance rather than to repair original features of the building. 
b.  It is preferable to repair rather than to reconstruct if possible. 
c.  It is preferable to restore by reconstruction of original features rather than to remove or remodel. 
d.  Contemporary design shall not be excluded from consideration.

a.  Siting; 
b.  Height; 
c.  Proportion; 
d.  Rhythm; 
e.  Roof area; 
f.  Entrance area; 
g.  Wall areas; 
h.  Detailing; 
i.  Fa&cgrave;ade;

(7)  No change shall be made in the scope of work for any building permit after issuance of a certificate of appropriateness without resubmitting to the HDC and receiving approval in the same manner as provided above. 
(Ord. No. 6188, § 6, 8-7-06) 
Sec. 2-357. - Demolition. 
(a)  If the application for a certificate of appropriateness involves the demolition of a building which the HDC initially determines to be an inappropriate demolition, then the HDC may defer the matter until such time as it has had an opportunity to consider the following alternatives to the demolition of subject property: 
(1)  Sources of funding for preservation and restoration activities if lack of such funds is the reason for the request to demolish. 
(2)  Adaptive use changes. 
(3)  An attempt to find a purchaser for the property who would maintain the building in a suitable and acceptable manner. 
(4)  The feasibility of moving the building to another appropriate location. 
(5)  Any such other solution as may be deemed advisable and in keeping with the spirit and intent of this division. 
(b)  The owner or other person having legal custody of any building or structure within a historic district shall keep the structure properly maintained and repaired in order to prevent demolition by neglect. However, during the time the HDC is considering any one of the alternatives above, progress reports shall be made by the HDC and/or its staff at its regularly scheduled meeting. If, at the expiration of six (6) calendar months from the date of the first public hearing of an application for demolition, the HDC has not found a viable alternative to the demolition of the property, the HDC shall reschedule the matter for public hearing requiring notices as aforesaid, and upon said public hearing, make its final determination as to the application. In such cases, the public hearing for final determination shall be held within one (1) calendar month after the expiration of the six (6) months from the date of the first public hearing; and at the second public hearing, the HDC may hear such matters as are considered necessary or desirable to be fully advised of all facts and circumstances pertaining to the proposed demolition. At the second public hearing, the HDC may immediately announce its decision or take the matter under advisement to its next regularly scheduled meeting but in no event longer than two (2) calendar months after the expiration of the six-month period after the first public hearing. If the HDC has rendered no decision on the application for demolition within two (2) calendar months after the expiration of the six (6) months following the first public hearing, the HDC shall consider the application as having been approved and shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. 
(Ord. No. 6188, § 7, 8-7-06) 
Sec. 2-358. - Economic hardship. 
    In addition to considering the matters brought to the attention of the HDC and the criteria set out above, the HDC may determine that failure to issue a certificate of appropriateness will involve a substantial economic hardship to the applicant. 
(1)  It shall be the incumbent on the applicant to demonstrate economic hardship to the HDC. 
(2)  If the property is a significant historic and community resource, the HDC may invoke up to a ninety (90) day delay of proposed work. During this period of delay, the HDC shall propose suitable alternatives to the proposed work for the applicant to investigate. The applicant, with the assistance of the HDC and/or city staff, shall investigate the feasibility of the proposed alternatives, and report their findings to the HDC. If the applicant fails such, the HDC may consider this failure in their deliberations. 
(3)  If, after the end of the ninety (90) day delay period, no reasonable use can be found or economic return can be obtained and there has been no substantial detriment to the historic district, the HDC may issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work. If the HDC finds otherwise, it shall deny the application for certificate of economic hardship, and record in its records the reasons therefore. 
(Ord. No. 6188, § 8, 8-7-06) 
Sec. 2-359. - Demolition by neglect.

The HDC shall notify the property owner of any violations of these maintenance requirements by mail, giving details of the violation along with a time period for remedy of the violation and consequences of failure to remedy the violation, as provided in section 2-343 of this division. 
(Ord. No. 6188, § 9, 8-7-06) 
Sec. 2-360. - Work not requiring a certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  Nothing in this division shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the historic district which does not involve a change in design, materials, or outer appearance. Such ordinary maintenance will not require a certificate of appropriateness. For the purposes of this division, proposed work consisting only of a change in exterior paint color shall be considered ordinary maintenance. 
(b)  This division shall not prevent the restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, preservation, alteration, construction, or demolition of any such feature that the building inspector or similar agent of the city shall certify is required for the public safety. In emergency situations, threatening life, limb or significant property damage, work may be authorized by the City of Pine Bluff without a certificate of appropriateness. Such work shall be done in accordance with the principles and specific criteria adopted under this division. When work is performed by city staff or utility companies under this emergency clause, the HDC shall be so notified by the next business day.

Sec. 2-362. - Appeal. 
    The HDC may adopt, within its own rules, procedures for addressing aggrieved applicants or reconsidering prior decisions. Any applicant still aggrieved by the determination of the HDC may, within thirty (30) days after the making of such decision, appeal the determination of the HDC to the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Arkansas. 
(Ord. No. 6188, § 12, 8-7-06) 
Sec. 2-363. - Enforcement. 
    In the event that work being performed is found not to be in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness, or upon notification of such fact by the historic district commission and/or city staff, the building inspector shall have the authority to and shall issue a stop work order. A stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to the owner's agent, or to the person doing the work. Upon issuance of the stop work order, the cited work shall immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order and the conditions under which the cited work is authorized to resume. Any person who shall continue any work after having been served with a stop work order, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day they continue work. A decision as to whether to continue the stop work order or lift the order shall be made by the HDC within five (5) business days.

(1)  Notice to owner of declaration of vicious dog. In instances where the dog is declared vicious, it shall be surrendered to the animal control officer and impounded. If possession of the dog is obtained other than through surrender by the owner, the animal control office shall, within forty-eight (48) hours, notify the owner of the dog in writing, hand-delivered, where feasible, or, if not, posted at the owner's or custodian's last known address, that the dog or animal has been determined to be vicious and has been impounded by animal control. The owner shall have five (5) business days from delivery of the notice within which to lodge a written notice of appeal with the animal control office contesting the determination of "viciousness." If the owner does not lodge an appeal of the determination by the end of the regular business hours on the fifth (5th) day, the manager of animal control may apply to the Pine Bluff Municipal Court for an order to have the dog euthanized. 
(2)  Court appearance. If the owner of the dog contests the determination of animal control that the dog is vicious, the animal control officer shall issue a citation to the owner to appear in Pine Bluff Municipal Court for maintenance of a vicious animal or dog. The dog shall remain at animal control pending trial and the owner shall be responsible for boarding fees.

In addition to the fine imposed, the court may order the dog removed from the city or euthanized, or declare the dog dangerous, if mitigating circumstances are present. In that event, failure to follow the provisions of section 5-43 regarding dangerous dogs may result in the permit of a vicious dog which has been downgraded to a dangerous dog being revoked and the dog ordered removed from the city or euthanized. 
(6)  Change of status. The owner or custodian of a vicious dog or a dangerous dog shall notify the division of animal control immediately that the dog is unconfined and on the loose, or has attacked a human being or domestic animal.

No permit shall be issued for a dangerous dog until all requirements listed herein shall have been met. In addition to all other fees authorized to be assessed, the animal control department may assess, and the owner or custodian of the dog must pay, the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for issuance of the permit allowing possession of a dangerous dog in the city.

(Code 1967, § 3-24) 
Sec. 6-48. - Zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. Such areas and zones are shown on the Grider Field Municipal Airport Zoning Map consisting of two (2) sheets, prepared by Southeast Arkansas Regional Planning Commission and dated June 21, 1976, which is attached to Ordinance No. 4552 and made a part hereof. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Visual approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty (250) feet wide. The approach zone extends outward uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Instrument approach zone. The inner edge of the instrument approach zone coincides with the width of the instrument primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide. The instrument approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a horizontal distance of fifty thousand (50,000) feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the instrument runway. 
(3)  Transitional zones. These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at ninety (90) degrees to the runway centerline, and the runway centerline extended, at the slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional zones for those portions of the instrument approach zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet, measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at ninety-degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(4)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the instrument runway primary surface and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to these arcs. 
(5)  Conical zone. The conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends upward and outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
(Code 1967, § 3-25) 
Sec. 6-49. - Zone height limitations (surfaces). 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zones. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Visual approach surface. This surface slopes upward twenty (20) feet horizontally for each foot vertically, beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the visual runway primary surface and extending outward a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(2)  Instrument runway approach surface. This surface slopes upward fifty (50) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of the instrument runway primary surface and extending outward to a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet along the extended runway centerline; thence it slopes upward forty (40) feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of forty thousand (40,000) feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(3)  Transitional surface. Slopes upward and outward seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation which is two hundred six (206) feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping upward and outward seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surface. Where the instrument approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, height limits sloping upward and outward seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically shall be maintained beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured at ninety-degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(4)  Horizontal surface. One hundred and fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or a height of three hundred fifty-six (356) feet above mean sea level. 
(5)  Conical surface. Slopes upward and outward twenty (20) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface and at one hundred and fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred and fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation. 
(b)  Where an area is covered by more than one (1) height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
(c)  Nothing in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to fifty (50) feet above the surface of the land. 
(Code 1967, § 3-26) 
Sec. 6-50. - Use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard to endanger the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. 
(Code 1967, § 3-27) 
Sec. 6-51. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of July 6, 1976, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to July 6, 1976, and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Grider Field Airport Manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city. 
(Code 1967, § 3-28) 
Sec. 6-52. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. 
(1)  However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of two thousand and seven hundred (2,700) feet from each end of the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone. 
(2)  Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on July 6, 1976, or on the effective date of any amendments to this article or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
State Law reference- Nonconforming uses, A.C.A. § 14-363-205. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of adjustments for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article. 
State Law reference- Variances, A.C.A. § 14-363-206. 
(e)  Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the owner of the nonconforming use, at such owner's own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. 
(Code 1967, § 3-29) 
Sec. 6-53. - Enforcement. 
    It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to administer and enforce the provisions of this article. Application for permits and variances shall be made to the zoning administrator upon a form furnished by him.

The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustments all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(c)  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of adjustments, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the board of adjustments on notice to the zoning administrator. 
(d)  The board of adjustments shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.

Within thirty (30) days after receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c), the chief executive officer shall investigate the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he intends to resolve it. If the chief executive officer decides to resolve the complaints, he shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Subject to the requirements of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, nothing said or done in the course of informal endeavors may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this article without the written consent of the persons concerned.

Both complaints and answers shall be verified. 
(c)  If within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with the chief executive officer, he/she has been unable to obtain a voluntary compliance with this article, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The chief executive officer will assist in the filing. 
(d)  If the chief executive officer has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance within thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected by this article, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of the complaint. If the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such practice or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate.

The chief executive officer may issue subpoenas to compel his access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The chief executive officer may administer oaths. 
(b)  Upon application to the chief executive officer, a respondent shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the name of the chief executive officer to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as subpoenas issued by the chief executive officer himself. Subpoenas issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent and shall state that they were issued at his request. 
(c)  Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief executive officer shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as witnesses in the United States district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him. 
(d)  Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the chief executive officer to revoke or modify the subpoena. The chief executive officer shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena requires appearance attendance at any unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that the compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other good reason. 
(e)  In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the chief executive officer or person at whose request it was issued may petition for enforcement in the District or Circuit Court of Pine Bluff/Jefferson County, Arkansas or the state court for the jurisdiction in which the person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, etc. 
(f)  Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify or answer any lawful inquiry or to produce records, documents, or other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or lawful order of the chief executive officer shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or incarcerated not more than one (1) year, or both. Any person who, with intent thereby to mislead the chief executive officer, shall make or cause to be made any false entry or statement of fact of any report, account, record, or other document submitted to the chief executive officer pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true, and correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter, or by any other means falsify any documentary evidence, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or incarcerated not more than one (1) year, or both.

A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred; provided, however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought pursuant to this section or subsection 7-340(d) in its discretion if conciliation efforts of the mayor are likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing practice complained of in the complaint made to the mayor and which practice forms the basis for the action in court. And provided, however, that any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued under the authority of this article, and involving a bond fide purchaser, encumbrance, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this section shall not be affected. 
(b)  The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) punitive damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff; provided, that the said plaintiff in the opinion of the court is not financially able to assume said attorney's fees.

    The contractor shall follow the following as minimum standards: 
(1)  Equipment and management capability. Each and every ambulance and all on-board equipment utilized by the contractor in performing services which are the subject of this article shall comply with applicable standards required for licensure. The provider shall maintain the equipment and shall employ sufficient backup equipment to ensure that a safe level of reserve equipment capacity is available to provide peak period ambulance coverage even at times when unusual occurrences of equipment breakdown and routine equipment maintenance coincide. 
(2)  Personnel. The contractor shall ensure: 
a.  That two (2) persons certified under state law are on board each ambulance on ALS code 3 ambulance runs or available for dispatch, at least one (1) of which is certified as a paramedic, and the other of which is certified as a paramedic or emergency medical technician (EMT). 
b.  If only one (1) person on board is a certified paramedic, that person shall not function as the driver while the patient is on board. Every BLS ambulance subject to regulation under this article is required to have on board two (2) EMT's, one (1) to drive and the other to attend. The contractor shall establish and maintain sufficient management capability to ensure that equipment and personnel utilized are managed in an efficient and effective manner to produce the desired clinical performance and response time performance on a routine basis. 
(3)  Clinical performance. The clinical performance of the contractor and its personnel shall be consistent with and shall confirm to the operating procedures and medical protocols adopted by the local medical control. Where clinical performance deficiencies are discovered, the contractor shall demonstrate an aggressive and effective effort to correct the deficiencies in a timely manner. 
(4)  Response time performance. Response time performance standards are as follows: 
a.  Code 3 calls for life threatening emergencies. 
1.  The contractor shall furnish a diligent good faith effort to maintain an eight-minute (8:59) maximum response time for an advanced life support paramedic ambulance. The contractor shall employ enough personnel, acquire enough equipment and manage its resources in the manner necessary to meet the eight-minute response time standard on not less than ninety (90) percent of all presumptively designated code calls originating each month from within the city limits. 
2.  Where an ambulance unit is dispatched from a nontransporting first-response-only status its response time may be counted as the contractor ambulance response time even though the patient was transported by a different ambulance. In addition, the response time of a neighboring ambulance service responding by mutual aid request may also be counted as the contractor's ambulance response time, provided the level of life support capability furnished by the neighboring ambulance service is comparable to that required under this article, as determined by the local medical control, and provided that reliance upon neighboring ambulance service operators is only an occasional event and not a routine method of operation of the contractor. 
b.  Other run codes (non-life threatening). The contractor's response to other run codes shall be reasonable, but in every case where a conflicting demand for resources occurs, response to a code 3 call shall take precedence over requests for service requests. Furthermore, the contractor shall display sound judgment in developing its system status management plans to preserve a safe level of emergency response capability at all times by delaying response to requests for non-emergency service until additional ambulance units become available whenever the number of remaining ambulance units available for dispatch falls below a reasonably established safe level of emergency reserve capacity, as determined by historical demand analyses. 
c.  Retrospective designation. For purposes of this subsection, the designation of a run as code 3 shall be made by the contractor's system status management personnel at the point of dispatch on a presumptive basis and no retrospective alteration of such designation shall be allowed. However, runs may be retrospectively redesignated upward by the executive director, if the executive director disputes the original designation, and the contractor's board requests a determination from local medical control who then reviews and determines that the original designation was improper, given the information available to the EMS control center personnel at the time of the presumptive designation of the run code type. 
d.  Exempt calls. Certain types of calls may be excluded as specified by the medical director and the executive director on a standard form signed by both. Such records are maintained in the office of the operations manager. 
e.  Community response time. In addition to the response time performance standard required under this section for run code calls, the contractor shall furnish and manage its resources in the manner necessary to provide reliable emergency and nonemergency ambulance service throughout the entire city and shall perform its system status management and system status planning operations so as to minimize the differences in the respective average emergency-response-time performances among the various ambulance districts of the city to the greatest practical extent. In addition, the contractor shall take such steps as necessary to reduce or eliminate any continuing pattern of apparent discrimination in the average response time performance to any given ambulance district or portion thereof. 
(5)  Continuous physician medical control required. The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that its field personnel at all times have access to qualified medical control and direction concerning the care of patients in the field by a base station physician or nurse. All medical control and direction shall be available by reliable radio communications, according to the communications standards and applicable standards of medical control. 
(6)  Refusal to render emergency care prohibited. It is a violation of this article to fail to respond to a call to provide emergency ambulance service, to render first-aid treatment as is necessary, or to otherwise refuse to provide any emergency ambulance services within the scope of the ambulance operations, provided that these services are not required if the patient refuses to consent to treatment. 
(Ord. No. 6451, § 1(7), 6-17-13) 
Sec. 9-48. - Vehicle permits. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person subject to regulation by this article to operate an ambulance or helicopter service unless a currently valid state vehicle permit has been issued. 
(Ord. No. 6451, § 1(8), 6-17-13) 
Sec. 9-49. - Patient management and management of scene. 
    Authority for patient management in a medical emergency shall be invested in the senior paramedic designated by the contractor. Authority for the management of the scene of a medical emergency shall be vested in the senior paramedic until appropriate public safety officials arrive on the scene and take control. The scene of a medical emergency shall be managed in a manner described to minimize the risk of death or health impairment to the patient and to other persons who may be exposed to the risks as a result of the emergency condition, and priorities shall be placed upon the interests of those persons exposed to the more serious risks to life and health. Public safety officials shall ordinarily consult the senior paramedic in charge at the scene in the determination of relevant risk factors. In the event a licensed physician appears on the scene and desires to assume direction and control of patient care, the licensed physician may do so if the base station physician releases the paramedic from responsibility for directing patient care and the physician who is on scene continues care in the ambulance to the hospital. 
(Ord. No. 6451, § 1(9), 6-17-13) 
Sec. 9-50. - Extrication capabilities. 
    The ambulance service shall have extrication capabilities as defined by the Arkansas Department of Health, Division of EMS and Trauma Systems. 
(Ord. No. 6451, § 2, 6-17-13) 
Sec. 9-51. - Affiliation. 
    The ambulance service shall have a local dispatch center and its medical director shall be affiliated with Jefferson Regional Medical Center.

    The city council hereby finds and determines: 
(1)  The facilities and services afforded by the projects will be made available to the mentally retarded, without discrimination on the basis of race, creed, religion or sex. 
(2)  The projects are necessary in order to properly meet the requirements of the citizens and residents of the city and the state for health care facilities and services for the mentally retarded which are not being, and cannot be, reasonably met by other available health care facilities. Proper planning dictates that provision should be made for financing any additional facilities that may be required in the future in order for the corporation to satisfy the increasing health care needs of the citizens and residents of the city and the state ("subsequent projects"). 
(3)  Financing of the projects and subsequent projects under the act is and will be necessary for accomplishing the projects and subsequent projects and will insure the availability of quality health care facilities and services to the public at the lowest possible cost, thereby benefitting the public in general and the citizens and residents of the city in particular. 
(4)  The city is authorized by the provisions of the act to provide financing of health care facilities through the creation of a public facilities board and the issuance of revenue bonds by such a public facilities board. 
(5)  It is in the best interest of the city and its citizens and residents to create a public facilities board under the act and to limit the authority of that board to accomplishing, financing, contracting concerning, and otherwise dealing with health care facilities to be operated by the corporation.

    The board is empowered, from time to time, to own, acquire, construct, reconstruct, extend, equip, improve, sell, lease, contract concerning or otherwise deal in or dispose of health care facilities, including the making of mortgage loans with respect thereto (including specifically the projects and subsequent projects); provided, however, that the authority of the board shall be limited to such health care facilities as are sold or leased to the corporation or are otherwise dealt in, disposed of, or concerning which a loan is made to the corporation, pursuant to a contract between the board and the corporation. Each subsequent project shall be located within the city, but need not necessarily be at the same location and shall be operated by the corporation. The board shall have all of the powers provided for in the act, subject to the limitations of this article, and shall carry out its duties in accordance with the act. The board is hereby authorized and directed, in all dealings with the corporation to take all appropriate action with the corporation necessary to comply with the constitution and laws of the United States and of the state.

ARTICLE IV. - SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES; PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT 

Sec. 12-51. - Findings. 
    The City Council of the City of Pine Bluff does hereby find that: 
(1)  Numerous scientific studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution; 
(2)  Reliable scientific studies, including studies by the Surgeon General of the United States and studies commissioned and assessed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers by increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer, that children have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer, and to the elderly or others with compromised immune systems; 
(3)  Health hazards induced by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke include lung and other forms of cancer, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, decreased exercise tolerance, broncho-constriction and broncho-spasm, and that the most common cause of premature death from environmental tobacco smoke is heart disease; 
(4)  Reliable scientific studies assessed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have found that sidestream and secondhand tobacco smoke is a leading cause of premature death and disability among nonsmokers; 
(5)  Air pollution caused by smoking is an offensive annoyance and irritant. Smoking results in serious and significant physical discomfort of nonsmokers in public places and work places; and 
(6)  It is within its basic police powers to implement and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(7)  Electronic smoking devices, commonly known as "electronic cigarettes," "e-cigarettes," "e-cigars," "e-cigarillos," "e-pipes," "e-hookahs," "electronic nicotine delivery systems," etc., are battery operated devices designed to deliver nicotine, flavor, and/or other substances through a vapor inhaled by the user; and 
(8)  Use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent years; and 
(9)  Existing studies on electronic smoking devices' vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including: 
Chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, lead, nickel, and chromium; 
PM2.5, acrolein, tin, toluene, and aluminum, "which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin, eye, and respiratory irritation," neurological effects, damage to reproductive systems, and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke; 
Inconsistent labeling of nicotine levels in electronic smoking device products; and 
In one (1) instance, diethylene glycol, an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans. 
(10)  More than one (1) study has concluded that exposure to vapor from electronic smoking devices may cause passive or secondhand vaping; and 
(11)  The World Health Organization has strongly advised consumers against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are "deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body"; and 
(12)  The World Medical Association has determined that electronic smoking devices "are not comparable to scientifically proven methods of smoking cessation" and that "neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established"; and 
(13)  A study published in the Journal of Environmental and Public Health suggests that electronic smoking devices "may have the capacity to "re-normalize" tobacco use in a demographic that has had significant denormalization of tobacco use previously"; and 
(14)  Electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape, size, and color, with the user exhaling a smoke-like vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products; and 
(15)  The use of electronic smoking devices in smoke-free locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment; and 
(14)  It is the intent of the Pine Bluff City Council in enacting this section, to provide for the public health, safety, and welfare by prohibiting the use of electronic smoking devices; by protecting the public from exposure to secondhand by products of electronic smoking devices; by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smoke-free air laws; by reducing the potential for re-normalizing smoking in public places and places of employment; and by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle. 
(Ord. No. 6142, § 1, 6-6-05; Ord. No. 6569, § 1.a., 4-3-17)

[Sec. 19-1.2. - Sick leave bank.] 
(a)  There is hereby established a "Sick Leave Bank" for the use of uniformed employees. Uniformed employees means all firefighters and all sworn police officers, who by virtue of their employment are automatically eligible to participate in the bank. 
(b)  The sick leave bank shall be administered by a committee consisting of the chiefs of the fire and police departments, the human resources director, and a representative of the mayor's office, who shall preside as chair. The committee is charged with developing uniform criteria for the allocation of sick leave from the bank, which shall be approved by the city council and distributed to all uniformed employees. 
(c)  Any uniformed employee who has been employed as least one (1) year with the City of Pine Bluff, and who has earned sufficient sick leave, may elect to contribute in normal work shift increments. The maximum contribution to the sick leave bank shall be eighty (80) work hours for a uniformed police officer, and the nearest equivalent number of hours for a fire firefighter, with the administering committee to fix the maximum hours contribution for a fire fighter, taking into account the difference in normal work shifts for firemen and policemen, but in no event exceeding a maximum annual contribution of eighty-eight (88) hours for firemen. The employee may elect the contribution on a form to be developed by the administering committee, which shall be signed by the employee. Once a contribution is made it is irrevocable. 
(d)  A uniformed employee is eligible to apply for sick leave from the sick leave bank if he or she: 
(1)  Is in good standing with the department; 
(2)  Has exhausted all paid annual and sick leave and other compensatory time; 
(3)  Submits written verification from his or her treating physician that the employee is incapable of returning to work in any capacity at the time all leave and compensatory time has been exhausted; 
(4)  The illness or injury is not job related or covered by worker's compensation. An employee may receive a maximum of two hundred forty (240) hours of sick leave from the sick leave bank in any 12-month period. An employee need not have personally contributed to the sick leave bank to be approved for or receive sick leave from the bank. 
(e)  The administering committee of the Sick Leave Bank may approve sick leave for any uniformed employee who meets the criteria set forth in subsection (d) at the time this section goes into effect. It shall make quarterly reports to the mayor and city council of the balance of hours in the sick leave bank. The balance of hours in the bank should not exceed ten thousand (10,000). 
(f)  No uniformed employee shall be required to contribute to the sick leave bank. Once hours are contributed, the amount contributed will be subtracted from the employee's earned sick leave allocation and he or she will no longer have any right to the use of the hours or entitled to compensation upon retirement for the hours contributed.

    The retirement system known as "The Retirement System of the City of Pine Bluff," which was created and established effective July 1, 1971, is continued. The terms of this system are restated in their entirety by this article. 
    The purpose of the system is to provide retirement and incidental benefits for eligible nonuniformed employees of the city who complete required periods of service with the city. This system has been established and will be maintained for the exclusive benefit of its members and their beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided in the system, no part of the contributions to the system will revert to the city or be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of its members and their beneficiaries. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 1, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 6253, § 1, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-27. - Definitions and service rules. 
(a)  Words/phrases. The words and phrases listed in this paragraph (a) have the following meanings and are applied as described in the system unless a different meaning or application is plainly required by context: 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit of equal value computed by using the 1983 Individual Annuity Mortality Table for females with no adjustment and an interest rate of six (6) percent per annum. 
    Beneficiary means a person designated by a member of the system who is or may become entitled to receive a benefit under the system. 
    Child means a son or daughter born to or adopted by an individual. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
    Compensation means any earnings reportable as W-2 wages for federal income tax withholding purposes, except that compensation ((i) does not include (a) reimbursements or other expense allowances, fringe benefits (cash and non-cash), moving expenses, deferred compensation and welfare benefits and (b) elective deferrals described in Code § 125. Compensation (ii) does include elective deferrals under Code § 402(g), § 402(h), § 403(b), § 457(b) or § 132(f)(4). Compensation will include employee contributions to this plan which are treated as employer contributions under Code § 414 (h)(2). Differential wage payments (as defined in Code § 3401(h)(2) paid to an individual in active qualified military service shall not be treated as compensation under this section. 
    For any system year beginning after December 31, 1988, the retirement board will take into account no more compensation than the compensation limitation prescribed by Code § 401(a)(17) ("compensation limitation"). The compensation limitation is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) for the 1989 system year, a higher indexed amount for the 1990 through 1993 system years, and one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) for the 1994 system year. For system years beginning after December 31, 1994, the compensation limitation is the adjusted dollar amount determined in accordance with Code § 401(a)(17). For system years beginning after December 31, 2001, the compensation limitation is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code § 401(a)(17)(B). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the system year that begins with or within such calendar year. This limitation also applies to any twelve-month period for which the system measures a member's compensation and on a pro-rated basis to any measuring period less than twelve (12) months. When determining final average compensation for any system year beginning after December 31, 1988, the compensation for any prior system year is subject to the compensation limitation in effect for that prior system year, using two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) as the compensation limitation in effect for any system year beginning prior to January 1, 1990. For system years beginning before January 1, 1997, the compensation limitation applies to the combined plan compensation of the member and his spouse or lineal descendant under the age of nineteen (19) who is also a member. If the combined compensation of the member and a spouse or lineal descendants who are also members entitled to accrue benefits for a system year exceeds the compensation limitation, compensation for each member in the family unit means his compensation as adjusted by this paragraph ("adjusted compensation"). Adjusted compensation is the amount which bears the same ratio to the compensation limitation as the affected member's compensation (without regard to the compensation limitation) bears to the combined compensation of all the affected members in the family unit. The adjustment required by this provision will apply only for system years in which Code § 401(a)(17) (or a successor Code provision) applies to family members on an aggregated basis. 
    Contributions plus interest means at any applicable distribution date the amount of contributions made to the system by a member (including those "picked-up" by the city) plus interest which has been credited to his account and which has not yet been distributed to him under the system. A member's account is credited each December 31 with interest equal to five (5) percent of the member's previous December 31 account balance. 
    Elected official means an employee who was elected to his office by the people of Pine Bluff. 
    Employee means an individual employed by the city in nonuniformed employment, and includes both a regular employee and an elected official as the context requires. The term "employee" does not include an individual employed by the city police department, fire department or any other uniformed city department who is eligible for benefits under or membership in any other retirement system or plan (except Federal Social Security) by virtue of his employment with such department. 
    Final average compensation means for an employee his average monthly compensation for his five (5) consecutive calendar years of service in which his compensation is the highest of his last ten (10) calendar years of service prior to his separation from service. For purposes of fifty (50) percent election official benefit computations, (section 19-30(a)(3)b., section 19-30(c)(4)b., and the second sentence of section 19-30(d)(2), final average compensation means the average annual compensation of the elected official during his last five (5) calendar years of service as an elected official only (whenever rendered) prior to his separation from service. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of the above section 19-27(a), this subsection 19-27(a)(1) provides that, for regular employees that satisfied the eligibility requirements for a normal retirement allowance on or before December 31, 2012, based on the eligibility requirements effective prior to January 1, 2013, average compensation means for an employee his average monthly compensation for his three (3) consecutive calendar years of service in which his compensation is the highest of his last ten (10) calendar years of service prior to his separation from service. For purposes of fifty (50) percent elected official benefit computations, (section 19-30(a)(3)b., section 19-30(c)(4)b., and the second sentence of section 19-30(d)(2), final average compensation means the average annual compensation of the elected official during his last three (3) calendar years of service as an elected official only (whenever rendered) prior to his separation from service. 
    Former employee means an individual formerly employed by the city who retired from service before July 1, 1971 and was receiving as of July 1, 1971, a pension under the Arkansas State Employees' Retirement System by virtue of such former city employment. 
    Hour of service means each hour for which the city, either directly or indirectly, pays an employee, or for which the employee is entitled to payment, for the performance of duties, or for reasons other than for the performance of duties, such as leave of absence, vacation, holiday, sick leave, illness, layoff, jury duty or military duty. 
    Married member means a member who has been lawfully married continuously for the one-year period prior to his death or earlier benefit payment event for which marital status is relevant. An "unmarried member" is a member who is unmarried or has been lawfully married continuously for less than one (1) year prior to his death or earlier benefit payment event for which marital status is relevant. 
    Member means each regular employee and each elected official who becomes a participant in the system by reason of his employment as provided in section 19-28. 
    Regular employee means each employee who is not an elected official that regularly performs thirty (30) or more hours of service per week. 
    Retirement board means the City of Pine Bluff Retirement Board (described in section 19-36) which will administer the system. 
    Retirement fund means the trust (described in section 19-37) known as the "City of Pine Bluff Retirement Fund." 
    Service means any period of time during which an employee is employed by the city, including any period of authorized unpaid leave of absence. 
    Severance from employment means a separation from service with the city of not less than thirty (30) consecutive days in duration. Effective for employees employed as of September 1, 2002, any employee who was previously employed under the federally funded Community Employment Training Act (CETA) or equivalent program will accrue service credit for the years in which the employee was a CETA employee in the same manner as if the employee had worked for the city during the same period, but only if the former CETA employee makes member contributions for the period of the CETA service in the same amount as would have been required for service with the city. 
    Spouse means the individual to whom a member is lawfully married at the time of his death or earlier benefit payment event for which marital status is relevant. 
    System means the retirement system of the city as stated in this article and later amendments to it by ordinance (if any). Reference to sections and paragraphs of the system are to this article and later amendments to it by ordinance (if any). 
    System year means the fiscal year of the system, a twelve (12) consecutive month period ending every December 31. 
(b)  Years of service rules. The following phrases and service rules have the following meanings and are applied in the system unless a different meaning or application is plainly required by context: 
    [Year of service.] For a regular employee, a "year of service" means a twelve (12) consecutive month computation period during which he regularly performs thirty (30) or more hours of service per week (and fractional year of service when the fractional year is continuing and consecutive to year of service). For an elected official, a "year of service" means a twelve (12) consecutive month computation period during which he is in service (and fractional year of service when the fractional year is continuing and consecutive to year of service). The initial computation period is the twelve (12) consecutive month period which begins with the employee's employment commencement date. Subsequent computation periods are each twelve (12) consecutive month period which begins with the anniversary of the employee's commencement date. 
    Employment commencement date is the date on which the employee first performs an hour of service for the city. If an employee has a severance from employment, he establishes a new employment commencement date on the date he first performs an hour of service for the city after the severance from employment. 
    [Forfeiture of years earned.] Except as provided in section 19-30, subparagraph (c)(2), with respect to former disabled individuals, if an employee has a severance from employment and is paid a benefit of any type under this system, the employee loses all years of service earned under the system through his severance from employment. If the employee thereafter re-enters the system as a member, he will do so as a new member without credit for any previous years of service. 
    Current service means service rendered by an employee after July 1, 1971. 
    Prior service means service rendered by an employee or former employee before July 1, 1971, and for an employee or former employee whose participation in the state employee's retirement system was terminated by the establishment of this system, all credited service rendered by this individual before July 1, 1971, as an employee for any public employer as such terms are defined under that state system. 
    Years of service means the total number of years of service of an employee (both as a regular employee and as an elected official), and where applicable for an employee or former employee, the total number of years of service rendered after July 1, 1971 plus the number of years of prior service. 
(c)  Construction. Where appropriate to the context, pronouns or other words expressed in one (1) number and gender in this system will include the other numbers and genders. The headings inserted in this system are for convenience only, are not a part of this system and may not be used in a construction of it. Use of the word "person" refers to both natural persons (i.e. individuals) and artificial persons (e.g. corporations, partnerships, etc.) as appropriate to the context. The uncapitalized use of a defined word or phrase has been used when making a generic reference to an individual, a position, etc., and includes a defined word or phrase within such reference in proper context. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 2, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5632, § 1, 11-20-95; Ord. No. 5633, § 1, 12-4-95; Ord. No. 6035, 11-4-02; Ord. No. 6094, § 1, 6-7-04; Ord. No. 6166, § 2, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 6229, § 3, 11-5-07; Ord. No. 6253, § 2, 8-4-08; Ord. No. 6281, § 1, 5-4-09; Ord. No. 6340, § 1, 12-20-10; Ord. No. 6418, § 1, 12-3-12) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 6281, § 2, adopted May 4, 2009, provides a retroactive effective date of April 28, 2009, and applies to applications for a retirement pension which were pending at the time the Retirement Board voted for the recommended change. 
Sec. 19-28. - Membership. 
(a)  Eligibility and participation. Each regular employee and each elected official must become a participant in the system as a condition of his employment with the city. Every employee in service on July 1, 1971 became a participant in the system on July 1, 1971. Each regular employee and elected official will become a participant in the system on their date of hire as an employee. Each member of the system is subject to all of the provisions of this article and later amendments by ordinance (if any) to it and to all rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the retirement board. 
(b)  Status notice. It will be the duty of the head of each department of the city to give notice in writing to the retirement board of any new employee, of the change in status of any member in his department resulting from leave of absence, resignation, reinstatement, dismissal, death, marriage, remarriage, etc. and of any change of beneficiary made by a member. The head of each department will furnish additional information concerning any member as the retirement board may require. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 3, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5958, § 1, 8-6-01; Ord. No. 6094, § 2, 6-7-04; Ord. No. 6229, § 4, 11-5-07; Ord. No. 6253, § 3, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-29. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. Each member is required to participate to the system as a condition of employment. The rate of contribution by a member through December 31, 1988 was six (6) percent of his compensation. After December 31, 1988, the rate of contribution by a member will be three (3) percent of his compensation. Effective April 1, 1997, member contributions will be treated as contributions paid by the city in lieu of contributions by the member and will be paid directly to the system. The city intends for this "pick-up" arrangement to meet the requirements of Code § 414(h)(2) or any successor provision. 
(b)  Payroll deduction. Member contributions will be paid through payroll withholdings by the city from the member's compensation. The retirement board will adopt rules and regulations governing payroll withholding for member contributions. All amounts deducted for each pay period by the city will be paid as soon as practical into the retirement fund and credited by the retirement board to the individual accounts of the members. Every member is deemed by acceptance of his employment to have consented and agreed to his member contributions to the system. Each payroll payment, less the member's contribution, will be a full and complete discharge of all claims and demands by the member for the service rendered by the member during the time period covered by the payment, other than the claims to the benefits to which the member may be entitled under the system. 
(c)  City contributions. At the end of each month, the city will pay into the retirement fund the balance of the contributions required to fund the benefits provided by the system. As of December 31, 1988, the city made monthly payments in satisfaction of its contributions to the system at the rate of ten and one-half (10.5) percent of the total compensation of each member. After December 31, 1988, the city will make monthly payments in satisfaction of its contributions to the system at the rate of seven (7) percent of the compensation of each member. These contributions of the city into the retirement fund are hereby made obligations of the city. The city council or applicable commissions of the city will appropriate annually amounts necessary to make these contributions. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 4, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5958, § 2, 8-6-01; Ord. No. 6094, § 3, 6-7-04; Ord. No. 6229, §§ 5(a), 5(b), 11-5-07; Ord. No. 6253, § 4, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-30. - Retirement dates and allowances. 
(a)  Normal retirement. 
(1)  Eligibility-Regular employee. A regular employee is eligible for a normal retirement allowance on the earlier of the date he has: 
a.  Completed ten (10) years of service and attained age sixty-five (65); 
b.  Completed twenty (20) years of service and attained age fifty-five (55); or 
c.  Completed twenty-eight (28) years of service regardless of age. 
d.  Notwithstanding the above, a regular employee hired after December 31, 2012, is eligible for a normal retirement allowance on the earlier of the date he has:

ii.  Completed twenty-five (25) years of service and attained of age fifty-five (55), or 
iii.  Completed thirty (30) years of service regardless of age. 
(2)  Eligibility-Elected official. An elected official is eligible for a normal retirement allowance once he has completed ten (10) years of service as an elected official and attained age fifty-five (55). 
(3)  Normal retirement allowance. The normal retirement allowance of a member whose benefit begins to be paid (or is paid in lump sum) after September 16, 1999, is equal to the larger of: 
a.  A monthly benefit of two and one-tenth (2.1) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service after December 31, 1988 plus three and two-tenths (3.2) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service prior to January 1, 1989; 
b.  A monthly benefit of fifty (50) percent of his final average compensation if he has ten (10) or more years of service as an elected official. 
Example 1: If an elected official has twenty (20) years of service prior to January 1, 1989 as a regular employee and ten (10) years of service after January 1, 1989 as an elected official, after August 2, 2004, he will receive a normal retirement allowance equal to eighty-five (85) percent of his final average compensation (since this allowance is larger than the fifty (50) percent final average compensation allowance he would be entitled to as an elected official). 
Example 2: If a regular employee has eight (8) years of service prior to January 1, 1989 as a regular employee and ten (10) years of service after January 1, 1989 as an elected official, after August 2, 2004, he will receive a normal retirement allowance equal to fifty (50) percent of his final average compensation (since this allowance is larger than the forty-six and six-tenths (46.6) percent of final average compensation allowance he would be entitled to as a regular employee). 
(4)  Beginning date. A member's normal retirement allowance will begin to be paid (or if permitted, be paid in lump sum) to him on the first day of the month following the date on which he has satisfied the age and service requirements for the benefit and had a severance from employment, or as soon as is administratively practical following this date. 
(5)  Prior law. A member whose normal retirement allowance began being paid (or was paid in lump sum) prior to August 2, 2004, received the allowance calculated according to the terms of the system in existence at the time the benefit began being paid (or was paid in lump sum). 
(b)  Early retirement. 
(1)  Eligibility. A regular employee is eligible for an early retirement allowance once he has completed ten (10) years of service and attained age fifty (50). Elected officials are not eligible for an early retirement allowance. 
(2)  Early retirement allowance. The early retirement allowance of a regular employee whose benefit begins to be paid (or is paid in lump sum) after August 2, 2004, is equal to a monthly benefit of two and one-tenth (2.1) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service after December 31, 1988, plus three and two-tenths (3.2) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service prior to January 1, 1989. 
(3)  Beginning date. A regular employee's early retirement allowance will begin to be paid (or if permitted, be paid in lump sum) to him on the date at which he becomes eligible to receive a normal retirement allowance. With the consent of the retirement board, a retirement allowance which is the actuarial equivalent of the early retirement allowance described in the previous sentence may begin to be paid (or if permitted, be paid in lump sum) to the member on the first day of the month following the date he has a severance from employment, or as soon as is administratively practical following this date. 
(4)  Reserved. 
(c)  Disability retirement. 
(1)  Eligibility. A member who has completed ten (10) years of service and becomes disabled while in service will receive a disability retirement allowance for so long as he continues to be disabled. If a member is still disabled at the date at which he would have otherwise become eligible to receive a normal retirement allowance had he continued in service, he will continue to receive the disability allowance until his death regardless of his recovery from disability. 
(2)  Recovery from disability. If a disabled member recovers from disability, is re-employed and required to further participate in the system under section 19-28, paragraph (b), the retirement board will restore his years of service to the date of his disability retirement. The recovered member will then continue to accrue benefits under the system based on his years of service at and after the disability. 
(3)  Disability definition. "Disabled" means that the member, because of a physical or mental disability, is unable to perform the duties of his customary position of employment or is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity for an indefinite period which the retirement board considers will be of long continued duration. The retirement board may require the member to submit to the physical examination of as many as two (2) physicians in order to confirm disability. The retirement board may require a member to submit evidence of his continued eligibility for the disability allowance at any time he is receiving the disability allowance. The retirement board may not require such evidence to be furnished more frequently than semi-annually. In the event that a disabled member refuses or fails to submit evidence of his continued disability when requested by the retirement board, the trustee upon written notice from the retirement board will discontinue the disability allowance until the member submits satisfactory evidence of his continued disability. 
(4)  Disability retirement allowance. The disability retirement allowance of a member whose benefit begins to be paid (or is paid in lump sum) after August 2, 2004, is equal to the larger of: 
a.  A monthly benefit of two and one-tenth (2.1) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service after December 31, 1988, plus three and two-tenths (3.2) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service prior to January 1, 1989; 
b.  A monthly benefit of fifty (50) percent of his final average compensation if he has ten (10) or more years of service as an elected official. 
(5)  Beginning date. A member's disability retirement allowance will begin to be paid to him on the first day of the month following the date his disability is determined by the retirement board, or as soon as is administratively practical following this date. The disability retirement allowance will not be actuarially reduced for payment prior to the time the member would have otherwise become eligible to receive a normal retirement allowance had he continued in service. 
(6)  Prior law. A member whose disability retirement allowance began being paid (or was paid in lump sum) prior to August 2, 2004, received the allowance calculated according to the terms of the system in existence at the time the benefit began being paid (or was paid in lump sum). 
(d)  Deferred retirement. 
(1)  Eligibility. If a member has a severance from employment with ten (10) or more years of service but he has not satisfied the age requirement for a normal retirement allowance, he can become eligible for a deferred retirement allowance by electing not to receive his contributions plus interest as a termination benefit. He will become eligible to receive the deferred retirement allowance when he attains age sixty-five (65). If this member is re-employed by the city and required to further participate in the system under section 19-28, paragraph (a), he will then continue to accrue benefits under the system based on his years of service at the time of his separation from service plus his years of service after his re-employment. 
(2)  Deferred retirement allowance. The deferred retirement allowance of a regular employee is equal to a monthly benefit of two and one-tenth (2.1) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service after December 31, 1988, plus three and two-tenths (3.2) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service prior to January 1, 1989. An elected official's deferred retirement allowance is equal to a minimum annual benefit of fifty (50) percent of his final average compensation. 
(3)  Beginning date. A member's deferred retirement allowance will begin to be paid (or if permitted, be paid in lump sum) to him on the date at which he attains age sixty-five (65). With the consent of the retirement board, a retirement allowance which is the actuarial equivalent of the deferred retirement allowance described in the previous sentence may begin to be paid (or if permitted, be paid in lump sum) to the member on the first day of the month following the date he attains age fifty (50), or as soon as is administratively practical following this date. 
(4)  Prior law. A member whose deferred retirement allowance began being paid (or was paid in lump sum) prior to August 2, 2004, received the allowance calculated according to the terms of the system in existence at the time the benefit began being paid (or was paid in lump sum). 
(e)  Normal form of retirement allowance. The retirement board will compute a member's retirement allowance in the form of a straight life annuity. 
(f)  Application for retirement benefits. A regular employee or an elected official may elect to retire at any time after he has satisfied the age and service requirements applicable to his retirement allowance. In order for a normal or early retirement allowance to begin to be paid (or if permitted, be paid in lump sum) to a member, a member (or his representative) must make written application to the retirement board not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to his requested retirement date and separation from service. A member who becomes disabled must apply to the retirement board for certification of his disabled status as soon as is practical. A member will elect a deferred retirement allowance in accordance with retirement board procedures. All applications and elections concerning retirement allowance will be made in writing and on forms approved by the retirement board. 
(g)  Minimum retirement benefit. If a member's or spouse's normal, early, disability or deferred retirement allowance results in a monthly benefit of less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), the member or spouse will receive a monthly benefit of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month. If a deceased member's children under age twenty-two (22) or other beneficiaries are sharing a member's benefit, all of the member's children under age twenty-two (22) or beneficiaries will receive a combined benefit of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month or such larger amount as they are entitled to receive under the terms of the system. 
(h)  1997 cost-of-living adjustments. Effective May 1, 1997, a member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary who receives or is receiving a normal, early, disability or deferred retirement allowance in the form of an annuity payable monthly will receive an increased monthly benefit which is the larger of: 
(1)  The monthly benefit that the member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary receives (or would receive without regard to subsection (g) above) multiplied by the total number of years since the date the member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary began receiving the retirement allowance and multiplied times one point zero two (1.02); or 
(2)  The minimum retirement benefit of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) pursuant to subsection (g) above. 
(i)  1999 benefit increase. Effective the first day of the month following September 16, 1999, a member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary who receives or is receiving a normal, early, disability or deferred retirement allowance in the form of an annuity payable monthly will receive an increased monthly benefit which is fifty dollars ($50.00) more per month than the benefit that member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive under the system. This increased benefit is prospective only and does apply to benefits received monthly beginning after September 16, 1999. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 5, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5632, § 2, 11-20-95; Ord. No. 5633, §§ 2-6, 12-4-95; Ord. No. 5688, §§ 1-9, 3-21-97; Ord. No. 5828, § 1-9, 8-16-99; Ord. No. 5958, §§ 3-9, 8-6-01; Ord. No. 6067, §§ 1-7, 6-16-03; Ord. No. 6103, §§ 1-8, 8-2-04; Ord. No. 6253, § 5, 8-4-08; Ord. No. 6418, § 2, 12-3-12) 
Sec. 19-31. - Forms and optional forms of payment. 
(a)  Form of benefit. 
(1)  Married member. Except as limited by subparagraph (b)(2), the normal, early or deferred retirement allowance of a married member will be paid in one hundred (100) percent joint and survivor's annuity form unless the married member elects lump sum payment with retirement board consent. The annuity for the married member is an immediate life annuity payable monthly to the married member for his life which is equal to the life annuity he would have received were he not married, with a survivor's annuity payable monthly after his death to his spouse for her remaining life which is one hundred (100) percent of the annuity payable to the married member during his life. 
(2)  Unmarried member. Except as limited by subparagraph (b)(2), the normal, early or deferred retirement allowance of an unmarried member may be paid in one (1) of the following forms, each of which, except for the joint and fifty (50) percent survivor annuity described in subsection d. below, shall be the actuarial equivalent of a the benefit payable to such member in the form of a straight life annuity: 
a.  Immediate straight life annuity form; 
b.  Lump sum payment with retirement board consent as described in subparagraph (b)(1); 
c.  An unmarried member may elect to receive his normal or early retirement allowance in joint and one hundred (100) percent survivor annuity form. The joint and one hundred (100) percent survivor annuity for an unmarried member is an immediate joint life annuity payable monthly to the unmarried member for his life, with a survivor's annuity payable monthly after his death to his designated beneficiary for the beneficiary's remaining life which is one hundred (100) percent of the annuity payable during the unmarried member's life; or 
d.  An unmarried member may elect to receive his normal or early retirement allowance in an unreduced joint and fifty (50) percent survivor annuity form. The unreduced joint and fifty (50) percent survivor annuity for an unmarried member is an immediate joint life annuity payable monthly to the unmarried member for his life, with a survivor's annuity payable monthly after his death to his designated beneficiary for the beneficiary's remaining life which is fifty (50) percent of the annuity payable during the unmarried member's life. This joint and fifty (50) percent survivor annuity payable to the unmarried member during his lifetime will be in the same amount as the member's immediate straight life annuity. 
(3)  Disabled member. Except as limited by subparagraph (b)(2), the disability retirement allowance of a member will be paid in immediate straight life annuity form. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), and except as limited by subparagraph (b)(2), the normal, early or deferred retirement allowance for any member who has not satisfied the eligibility requirements for a normal retirement allowance on or before December 31, 2012, will be paid in one (1) of the following forms, each of which, shall be the actuarial equivalent of a benefit payable the form of a life annuity: 
a.  Immediate straight life annuity form; 
b.  Lump sum payment with retirement board consent as described in subparagraph (b)(1); 
c.  Fifty (50) percent joint and survivor annuity form; or 
d.  One hundred (100) percent joint and survivor annuity form. 
(b)  Lump sum. 
(1)  More than $5,000.00. A member may request in writing that the retirement board make payment of twenty-five (25) percent, fifty (50) percent, seventy-five (75) percent or one hundred (100) percent of his normal, early or deferred retirement allowance in lump sum form if this lump sum amount is in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and the balance, if any, subject of subparagraph (b)(2) in annuity form as described in subsection (a) above. If the retirement board (in its sole discretion) determines that payment of all or the applicable portion of the member's retirement allowance in lump sum form will not harm the soundness of the system, all or the applicable portion of the member's retirement allowance will be paid to him in lump sum form and the balance in annuity form. This alternative lump sum form of payment will be the actuarial equivalent of all or the applicable portion of the member's straight life annuity retirement allowance described in section 19-30. 
(2)  $5,000.00 or less. If the member's normal, early disability or deferred retirement allowance determined in lump sum form is five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or less, the member's retirement allowance will be paid to him in lump sum form and may not be paid in annuity form. 
(3)  For distributions on or after March 28, 2005, if the present value of the member's retirement allowance determined in a lump sum is greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000), distribution may not be made prior to age sixty-five (65) without the member's consent. 
(c)  Early payment actuarial adjustment. Each form of benefit paid under this section 19-31 before the member's applicable retirement date with retirement board consent (see section 19-30, subparagraphs (b)(3) and (d)(3), will be the actuarial equivalent of the member's straight life annuity retirement allowance as described in section 19-30 (computed by disregarding the effect of a subsidized survivor annuity under section 19-31, subparagraph (a)(1)). 
(d)  Direct rollover of eligible rollover distributions. A distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and any hardship distribution. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution and that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. For purposes of the direct rollover provisions above, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to (i) an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or (ii) to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a), 403(a) or 403(b) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. The system will allow a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer from this plan as a qualified rollover contribution to a Roth IRA described in Code § 408A. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 6, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5632, § 3, 11-20-95; Ord. No. 5633, §§ 7, 8, 12-4-95; Ord. No. 6114, § 1, 10-4-04; Ord. No. 6123, § 1, 12-20-04; Ord. No. 6253, § 6, 8-4-08; Ord. No. 6340, § 2, 12-20-10; Ord. No. 6418, § 3, 12-3-12) 
Sec. 19-32. - Death benefits. 
(a)  Member eligible for normal retirement. 
(1)  Married member. Except as limited by section 19-32, paragraph (d), if a married member dies after having become eligible under section 19-30, paragraph (a), for a normal retirement allowance but before the allowance has begun to be paid (or if permitted, been paid in lump sum) to him, his spouse will be paid a death benefit which is equal to the one hundred (100) percent subsidized survivor annuity that would otherwise be payable to this spouse under section 19-31, subparagraph (a)(1), if the married member's retirement allowance had begun to be paid under that subparagraph the day before his death. The death benefit will be payable in immediate straight life annuity form to the spouse. 
(2)  Unmarried member. Except as limited by section 19-32, paragraph (d), if an unmarried member dies after having become eligible under section 19-30, paragraph (a), for a normal retirement allowance but before the allowance has begun to be paid (or if permitted, been paid in lump sum) to him, his designated beneficiary will be paid a death benefit which is the actuarial equivalent of the member's straight life annuity retirement allowance computed under section 19-30. The death benefit will be payable in immediate straight life annuity form to the designated beneficiary. 
(3)  More than $5,000.00 lump sum. A spouse or designated beneficiary may request in writing that the retirement board make payment of his death benefit in lump sum form if this lump sum is in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the retirement board (in its sole discretion) determines that payment of this death benefit in lump sum form will not harm the soundness of the system, this death benefit will be paid to him in lump sum form. This alternative lump sum form of payment will be the actuarial equivalent of the death benefit described in section 19-32, subparagraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) (as applicable). 
(b)  Age 50; 10 years of service or 20 years of service. 
(1)  Married member. Except as limited by subsection (d), if an age fifty (50) or older married member has completed ten (10) years of service, or if any married member regardless of age has completed twenty (20) years of service but a retirement allowance has not yet begun to be paid (or if permitted been paid in lump sum) to him and he dies (whether in service or while waiting to become eligible for a deferred retirement allowance), a monthly death benefit equal to two and one-tenth (2.1) percent of the deceased member's final average compensation multiplied by his years of service after December 31, 1988, plus three and two-tenths (3.2) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service prior to January 1, 1989 will be payable to his spouse for her life. 
(2)  Unmarried member. Except as limited by subsection (d) if an age fifty (50) or older unmarried member has completed ten (10) years of service or if any unmarried member regardless of age has completed twenty (20) years of service, but a retirement allowance has not yet begun to be paid (or if permitted, been paid in lump sum) to him and he dies (whether in service or while waiting to become eligible for a deferred retirement allowance), a monthly death benefit equal to two and one-tenth (2.1) percent of the deceased member's final average compensation multiplied by his years of service after December 31, 1988, plus three and two-tenths (3.2) percent of his final average compensation multiplied by his years of service prior to January 1, 1989 will be payable to his designated beneficiary for the beneficiary's life. 
(3)  More than $5,000.00 lump sum. A spouse or designated beneficiary may request in writing that the retirement board make payment of his death benefit in lump sum form (if this lump sum is in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the retirement board (in its sole discretion) determines that payment of this death benefit in lump sum form will not harm the soundness of the system, this death benefit will be paid to him in lump sum form. This alternative lump sum form of payment will be the actuarial equivalent of the death benefit described in section 19-32, subparagraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) (as applicable). 
(c)  After disability retirement. If a member who is receiving a disability retirement allowance dies, a monthly death benefit will be paid to his spouse if he is married at death, or if not, to his children under age twenty-two (22). The monthly death benefit will be equal to fifty (50) percent of the monthly disability allowance being paid to the disabled member at this death. This monthly death benefit will be paid to the deceased member's spouse for the remainder of her life, and after her death, in equal shares to each of his then living children who are under age twenty-two (22) (if any) at each monthly payment date until the last child attains age twenty-two (22). If the deceased member was not married, this monthly death benefit will be paid in equal shares to each of his then living children who are under age twenty-two (22) (if any) at each monthly payment date until the last child attains age twenty-two (22). 
(d)  $5,000.00 or less lump sum. If the spouse's or designated beneficiary's death benefit determined in lump sum form is five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or less, the death benefit will be paid to the spouse or designated beneficiary in lump sum form and may not be paid in annuity form. 
(e)  Other members. If a member who is not described in section 19-32, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), dies while in service, a death benefit will be paid to his spouse if he is married at death, or if not, to his designated beneficiary. This death benefit will equal the deceased member's contributions plus interest and will be paid in a lump sum as soon as it is administratively practical for the system to do so. 
(f)  In the event that a member dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code § 414(u)), the beneficiary of the member shall receive any additional benefits provided under the plan as if the member had resumed service with the employer and then terminated employment on account of death. The additional benefits shall not include benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service. 
(g)  For distributions made after December 31, 2007, the system permits a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, to an individual retirement account or annuity ("IRA") established on behalf of an individual who is a designated beneficiary of the member and who is not the surviving spouse of the member. When made such transfer shall be treated as an eligible rollover distribution. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 7, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5632, § 4, 11-20-95; Ord. No. 5633, § 9, 12-4-95; Ord. No. 5958, § 10, 8-6-01; Ord. No. 6067, § 8, 6-16-03; Ord. No. 6103, § 9, 8-2-04; Ord. No. 6253, § 7, 8-4-08; Ord. No. 6340, § 3, 12-20-10) 
Sec. 19-33. - Other benefits. 
(a)  Separation benefit. If a member has a severance from employment without being eligible for a normal, early or disability retirement allowance, he will be paid an amount equal to his contributions plus interest in a lump sum as soon as it is administratively practical for the system to do so, unless he is eligible to elect to qualify for a deferred retirement allowance and he so elects. 
(b)  Revoked deferred retirement allowance. With the consent of the retirement board and prior to the time that his deferred retirement allowance becomes payable to him, a member may request that his election to qualify for a deferred retirement allowance be revoked. In this event, this member will be paid an amount equal to his contributions plus interest in a lump sum as soon as it is administratively practical for the system to do so. 
(c)  Minimum benefit. If the total amount of benefits paid under the system to a member, his spouse, designated beneficiary or children, as and if applicable, is ever less than the member's contributions plus interest, the difference between these two (2) amounts will be paid in a lump sum to the member's designated beneficiary, or if no such beneficiary designation is on file with the retirement board, to his then surviving children in equal shares, or if none, to his probate estate as soon as it is administratively practical for the system to do so. 
(d)  No other benefits. No other benefits other than those that are specifically described for a situation are payable under the system. 
(1)  Lump sum. If a member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary receives payment of his normal, early, disability or deferred retirement allowance in lump sum form, or elects to receive payment of his contributions plus interest, as applicable, there will be no further benefits paid from the system to the member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary for any reason. A member, spouse, member's child or beneficiary who accepts a benefit in the form of a lump sum, waives the right to receive any future increases to benefit calculation even if any such increases have a retroactive application to others. 
(2)  Other retirement programs. Any employee or former employee otherwise covered by the system, including any elected official, who receives a retirement benefit from another retirement program which is pursuant to employment with the city waives the right to receive any retirement allowance from this system by accepting the benefit from the other retirement program. For purposes of this paragraph (2), the term "retirement program" will not include a retirement program which is funded entirely by contributions from the individual employee. 
(e)  Military service. Effective as of December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any provision of these resolutions to the contrary, benefits and service credits with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Code § 414(u). 
(f)  Required distributions. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of these resolutions, distribution shall commence no later than the required beginning date. The required beginning date is April 1 following the later of: (i) the calendar year in which the member reaches age seventy and one-half (70 1/2), or (ii) the calendar year in which the member retires. 
(2)  Under no circumstances shall a member be permitted to select any method of payment unless, under the terms of the method selected, the entire interest of such member will be distributed in accordance with final regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under § 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including the incidental benefit requirements of § 401(a)(9)(G) over the life of the member (or over the lives of the member and spouse) or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member (or the joint life expectancy of the member and spouse). 
(3)  Under any option elected by a member that provides for payments to a beneficiary after the death of the member, the benefits payable with respect to the member in the event of the member's death shall not be more than incidental, as determined under the final regulations under Code § 401(a)(9). 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 8, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5688, § 10, 3-21-97; Ord. No. 6253, § 8, 8-4-08; Ord. No. 6340, § 4, 12-20-10) 
Sec. 19-34. - Code § 415 limitation on benefits. 
(a)  The annual retirement allowance otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible benefit, as determined in (b) below. If the retirement allowance the member would otherwise accrue in a limitation year produces an annual pension benefit in excess of the maximum permissible benefit, the rate of accrual will be reduced so that the annual pension benefit will equal the maximum permissible benefit. If a member is, or has ever been, covered under more than one (1) defined benefit plan maintained by the employer, the sum of the member's annual benefits from all such plans, determined as of the same retirement age, may not exceed the maximum permissible benefit. If the sum of the annual benefits does exceed the maximum permissible benefit, the benefits from the plan in which benefits are currently being accrued will be reduced first. In the case where benefits are being accrued under more than one (1) plan, including this system, the accruals under this system will be reduced prior to the benefits in the other plan(s). 
(b)  Determination of annual pension benefit and maximum permissible benefit. 
(1)  Annual pension benefit. For purposes of this section, the term "annual pension benefit" shall mean for any limitation year, the retirement allowance, expressed in a form payable at normal retirement age, payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. Except as provided below, a benefit payable in a form other than a straight life annuity must be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity before applying the limitations of this section. 
    No actuarial adjustment to the benefit is required for: (1) the value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity; (2) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as the qualified disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); and (3) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance with Code § 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Solely for purposes of determining whether a benefit exceeds the limits of Code § 415 under this section, for benefits payable other than in the form of a lump sum, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of: (i) the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the system at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the member; or (ii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting date. 
    Solely for purposes of determining whether a benefit exceeds the limits of Code § 415 under this section, for benefits payable in the form of a lump sum, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is the greatest of: (i) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table specified in section 19-27; (ii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit, computed using a five point five (5.5) percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table for the distribution; or (iii) the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing on the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table), divided by one point zero five (1.05). The terms applicable interest rate and applicable mortality rate shall be as defined in the final Code § 415 regulations. 
(2)  Maximum permissible benefit. For purposes of this section, the term "maximum permissible benefit" shall mean, for any limitation year, the defined benefit dollar limitation, as defined below. This amount may be further adjusted in subsection (c). The "defined benefit dollar limitation" shall be one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00), as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under Code § 415(d) in such manner as the IRS shall prescribe, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation will apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies. Unless otherwise provided by law, adjustments for increases in the cost of living shall not be taken into account for any year before the year for which such adjustment first takes effect. 
(3)  Adjustments to the maximum permissible benefit. 
a.  If the member has less than ten (10) years of participation, the defined benefit dollar limitation described above, shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). A member is credited with a year of participation (computed to fractional parts of a year) for each accrual computation period for which the member is credited with the period of service required under the terms of the plan in order to accrue a benefit for the accrual computation period, and the member is included as eligible to participate in the plan for at least one (1) day of the accrual computation period. A member who is permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Code § 415(c) shall be credited with a year of participation (or part thereof) with respect to that period. In no event will more than one (1) year of participation be credited for any twelve-month period. 
b.  For purposes of determining a member's "maximum permissible benefit," the defined benefit dollar limitation above shall be adjusted for commencement of benefits before the attainment of sixty-two (62) or after the attainment of sixty-five (65). If benefits commence before the member attains age sixty-two (62), the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the member is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation at age sixty-two (62), with the actuarial adjustment as provided in the final Code § 415 regulations. 
If benefits commence after the member attains age sixty-five (65), the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the member is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the defined benefit dollar limitation at age sixty-five (65), with the actuarial adjustment as provided in the final Code § 415 regulations. 
(4)  Notwithstanding anything else in this section to the contrary, the benefit otherwise accrued or payable to a member hereunder shall be deemed not to exceed the maximum permissible benefit limitation if: 
a.  The retirement benefits payable for a system year under any form of benefit with respect to such member under this plan and under all other defined benefit plans (regardless of whether terminated) ever maintained by the employer do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) multiplied by the member's number of years of service or parts thereof (not to exceed ten (10)) with the employer; and 
b.  The employer has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan, a welfare benefit fund, an individual medical account, or simplified employee pension, in which the member participated. For this purpose only, employee contributions under a defined benefit plan (whether voluntary or mandatory) are not treated as a defined contribution plan. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 9, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5632, § 5, 11-20-95; Ord. No. 5633, § 10, 12-4-95; Ord. No. 6253, § 9, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-35. - Administration.

Members of the retirement board will serve without compensation, but will be reimbursed for necessary expenses incurred by them as members of the retirement board. The mayor will be the ex-officio chairman and the city clerk ex-officio secretary of the retirement board. The retirement board will meet at any time that the business of the system requires and the chairman will have the power to call meetings any time that it is necessary in order to carry out the business of the retirement board. Five (5) members of the retirement board will constitute a quorum to transact any business, but it will require not less than five (5) affirmative votes to carry out any matter before the board. 
(b)  Administration, management and control. Except as otherwise limited by this article and later amendments by ordinance (if any) to it and applicable law, the retirement board will have all powers as may be necessary to discharge its duties of management, direction and control of the system, including but not limited to the following powers and duties: 
(1)  To construe and interpret the system, decide all questions of eligibility and determine the amount, manner and time of payment of any benefits under it; 
(2)  To make a determination as to the right of any person to a benefit and to afford any person dissatisfied with such determination the right to a hearing on the issue; 
(3)  To receive from the city and from members such information as is necessary for the proper administration of the system; 
(4)  To prepare and distribute, in such manner as the board determined to be appropriate, information explaining the system; and 
(5)  To receive and review reports of the financial condition and of the receipts and disbursements of the retirement fund from the trustee. 
In the exercise of its powers, the retirement board will have no power to add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of the system, nor to change or add to any benefits provided by the system nor to waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility for a retirement allowance or other benefit under the system without the approval of the city council. 
(c)  Rules and regulations. The retirement board may, subject to approval of the city council, establish such rules and regulations as it deems proper for the administration of the system and the retirement fund. 
(d)  Employment of actuary and other agents. The retirement board, with the approval of the city council, will employ an actuary, who will be the technical advisor to the retirement board on matters relating to the operations of the system and may engage such other technical service or employ such other persons as may be necessary to transact the business of the system. 
(e)  Medical service and advice. The retirement board will secure such medical service and advice as may be necessary to carry out the disability provisions of the system. 
(f)  Records and accounts. The retirement board will keep at all times correct detailed records and accounts of the system and all transactions and matters relating to its administration. 
(g)  Annual report and audit. As soon as practical after the close of each calendar year, the retirement board will transmit to the city council an annual audit and actuarial report setting forth the financial condition of the system and its operation for the preceding calendar year. The retirement board will use the auditors selected for the city's annual financial audit of its operations. 
(h)  Authorization of benefit payments. The retirement board will issue directions to the trustee concerning all benefits which are to be paid from the system pursuant to its terms. The board will keep on file, in such manner as it deems convenient or proper, all trustee reports. 
(i)  Payment of expenses. All expenses incurred incidental to the administration, termination or protection of the system and retirement fund, including but not limited to actuarial, legal, accounting and trustee fees will be paid by the trustee from the retirement fund and, until paid, will constitute a first and prior claim and lien against the retirement fund. 
(j)  Conflict of interest. Except as herein provided, no member or employee of the retirement board will have any personal interest, direct or indirect, in the making of any investments from the retirement fund, or in the gains or profits accruing therefrom. Nor will any member or employee of the retirement board directly or indirectly for himself or as an agent or partner of others, borrow any funds or deposits of the retirement fund, or in any manner use the same except to make such current and necessary payments as are authorized by the retirement board. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 10, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 6129, § 1, 1-18-05; Ord. No. 6253, § 10, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-36. - Retirement fund and trustee. 
(a)  Retirement fund. There is a trust created under this section which will be known as the "City of Pine Bluff Retirement Fund" and this retirement fund will consist of all the moneys or other assets paid into this trust in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Appointment of trustee. With the approval of the city council, the trustee will be appointed by the city under a formal declaration of trust and the trustee will hold and administer the retirement fund. The trustee will serve at the pleasure of the city and will have such rights, powers and duties as the city provides in such declaration of trust as amended from time to time with the approval of the city council. 
(c)  Responsibility of the trustee. All contributions under the system will be paid to the trustee and will be held in trust and invested and reinvested by the trustee. All property and funds of the retirement fund, including income from investments and from all other sources, will be retained in trust for the exclusive benefit of the members, as provided in the system, and will be used to pay benefits to members or their beneficiaries or pay expenses of administration of the system and retirement fund. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 11, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 6253, § 11, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-37. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  Effect of social security payments. No modification of the benefits provided in this article and later amendments by ordinance (if any) to it will be made because of any amount or amounts payable to a member or beneficiary under the provisions of the Federal Social Security Act. 
(b)  Former city employee pensions. Any pension being received by a former employee as of July 1, 1971, under the Arkansas State Employees' Retirement system by virtue of such former city employment, will be assumed and administered under this retirement system. Each pension so assumed and administered will be adjusted to reflect the retirement benefits and conditions of payment extended under this system as if such former employee had retired on or after July 1, 1971, from service. Accordingly, this system will be interpreted by virtue of this provision to refer to and to include all former employees wherever appropriate concerning membership participation in this system and eligibility for retirement allowances. 
(c)  No assignments of benefits. Except with respect to any indebtedness owing to the city for which the city is given a lien on the debtor's distributive share of the retirement fund, any option, benefit or other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this article will not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, prior to actually being received by the person entitled to the benefit under the system. The retirement fund will not in any manner be liable for the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, reports of any persons entitled to benefits under the system. 
(d)  Disclaimer of liability. Neither the city, the trustee nor the retirement board guarantees the retirement fund in any manner against loss or depreciation and they will not be liable for any act or failure to act which is made in good faith pursuant to the provisions of the system or retirement fund. The city will not be responsible for any act or failure to act of the retirement board or the trustee. The trustee will not be liable for any act or failure to act of the city or the retirement board. The retirement board will not be responsible for any act or failure to act of the city or the trustee. 
(e)  Indemnification of retirement board. The retirement board will be indemnified by the trustee from the assets of the retirement fund against liability arising by reason of any act or failure to act made in good faith pursuant to the provisions of the system, including expenses reasonably incurred in the defense of any claim relating thereto. 
(f)  Employee indebtedness. In the event that an employee is discharged from employment with the city because of embezzlement or fraud in connection with his employment, conversion or misappropriation of city property or other event which results in the employee owing the city an indebtedness, and the reasons for this discharge are confirmed by the retirement board after the employee is afforded a hearing before the retirement board on the charges, the indebtedness owed to the city will be a lien against the benefits that the employee or his beneficiaries are entitled to receive under the system. The city will be entitled to receive the amount owed it by the employee from the system prior to any other payments being made to the employee or his beneficiaries. 
(g)  Facility of payment. The trustee may, in its discretion, do one or more of the following with respect to any payment that would be made to any individual at a time when he or she is under a legal disability (including minority): 
(1)  Take any action necessary to have a legal guardian appointed for such individual, if none has already been appointed, and make the payment to such legal guardian, without having to see to the proper application of such payment; or 
(2)  Name a custodian for the individual (who may be the trustee) under any appropriate uniform transfers (or gifts) to minors act, and make such payment to the custodian without having to see to the proper application for such payment. 
(h)  No beneficiary designation/death of beneficiary. If a member fails to name a beneficiary to receive a benefit, or if the beneficiary named to receive the benefit predeceases him, then the trustee will pay the benefit in the following order of priority: 
(1)  The member's spouse; 
(2)  The member's surviving children in equal shares; and 
(3)  The personal representative of the member's probate estate. 
(i)  Loans. The system does not allow the trustee to make loans to a member or a beneficiary from the assets of the trust for any reason. 
(j)  Qualified domestic relations orders.

(k)  Required period between employment service. An employee who has separated from service and received payment from the city retirement system shall not be eligible to apply for re-employment or to be rehired with the city until at least thirty (30) consecutive days has passed from the official date of separation and the date the person physically returns to duty in a position with the city. The employee shall not be entitled to any city benefits during the separation of service. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 12, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 5688, § 11, 3-21-97; Ord. No. 6166, § 1, 3-6-06; Ord. No. 6253, § 12, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-38. - Amendment of system. 
(a)  Authority. The city reserves the right acting by the city council to make amendments at any time to the system which will not cause any part of the retirement fund to be used for or diverted to any purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the system. 
(Ord. No. 5551, § 13, 7-19-93; Ord. No. 6253, § 13, 8-4-08) 
Sec. 19-39. - Termination/discontinuance of contributions. 
(a)  Right to terminate/discontinue contributions. The city may temporarily suspend contributions to the system, permanently discontinue contributions to the system or terminate the system at any time. Any temporary suspension of contributions will not constitute or require a termination of the system or retirement fund and will not preclude later contributions to the system. In the event of any suspension of contributions, the retirement fund will remain in existence as provided in this ordinance and the provisions of the system and retirement fund will remain in force. 
(b)  Termination. In the event of termination of the system, the trustee will determine the value of the retirement fund as of the next business day following the date of such termination. The trustee will then allocate the assets of the council system among the members and beneficiaries according to the following priorities: 
(1)  Benefits payable to each member of beneficiary equal to the member's contributions plus interest; 
(2)  Benefits in excess of the contributions plus interest payable as an annuity: 
a.  In the case of a member or beneficiary benefit which was in pay status as of the termination date; 
b.  In the case of a member benefit which would have been in pay status as of the last day of the system year prior to the termination date as if the member had retired this date and his benefits had then commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the system); 
(3)  Any other benefits under the system. 
If surplus assets exist after these allocations, the surplus assets will be allocated to each member or beneficiary in the ratio in which each member or beneficiary's total benefit bears to the total benefits of all members and beneficiaries. If assets are insufficient to provide all benefits under the system, the trustee will allocate such assets to satisfy obligations within each category by order of priority. If assets are insufficient to provide all benefits under a priority category, the trustee will allocate assets to members and beneficiaries within that category in the ratio in which each member and beneficiary's total benefit bears to the total benefits of all members and beneficiaries within that category. 
(c)  Manner of distribution. Any distribution after termination of the system or permanent discontinuance of contributions will be made as soon as administratively feasible at times and in amounts, in case or in kind, or in nontransferable annuity contracts as the retirement board, determines in its sole discretion. Each such distribution will be final and conclusive and not subject to question by any person. 
(d)  Residual amounts. In no event will the city receive any amounts from the retirement fund upon liquidation of the retirement fund except pursuant to section 19-37, paragraph (c), for indebtedness due from an employee. 
    EMERGENCY CLAUSE: Since it has been determined by the city that it is in the best interest of the city and its employees to immediately operate a retirement system pursuant to the above described conditions, an emergency is declared to exist, and this article will take effect and be in full force and effect from and after the date of its passage and approval.

Under this "point-for-point" rule as well as the 30-point written exam scale, a candidate who scores seventy (70) percent will be considered to have passed the examination but will receive zero (0) written examination points. No fractional score will be rounded up. 
(2)  Practical examination-Promotional process. When it is deemed necessary by the respective chief, use of a practical exercise as part of promotional procedure may be implemented. A practical examination may also be used anytime the chief considers this method to be the best method of selecting the best qualified person for a particular promotion. If used in lieu of a written exam, scoring requirements of minimum score, subsection (d)(1)a., above, shall apply. 
When a combination of written examination and practical examination are used, the candidate must successfully pass the written examination in order to proceed to the practical examination. One-half (1/2) of the points will be assigned to each examination. These scores will be averaged to reach the candidate's written exam score. The same 30-point scale and point-for-point award referred to in subsection (d)(1)b., allocation of points, above, shall apply to the averaged scores and be employed toward the overall final rating. 
(3)  Oral examination/interview. 
a.  In lieu of written exam. This type of examination may be used in lieu of or to supplement the written examination or to obtain information regarding the abilities of the competitors not readily obtainable in a written examination. If the chief chooses this form of examination, persons with special qualifications or expertise from outside the departments may be selected to assist the chief in conducting the oral examination/interview. When used in lieu of a written examination, the "minimum score" requirements, above, shall apply and points shall be allocated as stated above. 
The panel(s) performing oral examinations/interviews for the purpose of promotions will be comprised of the following people: 
1.  Police department. The panel shall consist of three (3) to seven (7) people selected by the chief or chief's designee, who may defer to the mayor or the human resources department when necessary. Those selected shall be peers from the public safety industry (fire fighting, police, emergency medical, etc.) who hold the equivalent or higher rank of the relevant position in question. The panel(s) may also include community leaders from both the private and public sectors. When community leaders are chosen for a particular panel they may not outnumber those from public safety industry on that particular panel. 
2.  Fire department. Three (3) to seven (7) people selected by the chief or chief's designee, who may defer to the mayor or the human resources department when necessary. Those selected shall be peers from the public safety industry (fire fighting, police, emergency medical, etc.) who hold the equivalent or higher rank of the relevant position in question. The panel(s) may also include community leaders from both the private and public sectors. When community leaders are chosen for a particular panel they may not outnumber those from public safety industry on that particular panel. 
b.  Oral examination and interview. The oral examination/interview will be used to supplement the written examination and to obtain information regarding the abilities of competitors not readily obtainable in the written examination. The chief will also use this opportunity to assess a candidate's efficiency rating 3 [] and his/her educational and vocational attainments. [] Factors to be considered in this process, besides formal education and vocation accomplishments, include physical fitness, awards, disciplinary actions, training, and experience. This information may be obtained from evaluation forms, personnel files and other such data as may be secured through the interview or from other sources. 
All candidates shall be asked the same pre-established set of questions which are designed to allow them to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and abilities in the areas of oral communication and problem-solving. These questions may be developed by the chief in consultation with department staff who may be chosen at the discretion of the chief. The chief may receive assistance from the Mayor and Human Resource Department, as may be necessary or as may be directed by the Mayor. Also, questions may be purchased from an outside consultant as necessary. 
A maximum of thirty (30) points 5 [] toward the overall promotional rating of one hundred (100) points shall be obtained from the oral examination/interview, except when an oral examination is used in lieu of a written examination. In that event, the examination may be more extensive than described in this section and shall be scored separately (thirty (30) points) as provided for in subsection (d)(1)b., allocation of points, above. 
The interview will be scored and the points allocated by the panel as follows: 
1.  Ten (10) points for oral communication skills; and 
2.  Twenty (20) points for problem solving ability. 
All of the compiled information, with the exception of written test scores, will be sealed and held by the chief of the department until immediately after the interviews are completed. The chief will then score and compile the results and complete the eligibility list using all materials and results from the process (oral interview(s), written testing, documentation, etc.). 
(4)  Staff evaluation and point allocation. 
a.  Fire department evaluations: 
1.  Firefighter: Evaluated by a staff panel made up of a lieutenant, station captain, battalion chief and deputy chief. 
2.  Engineer: Evaluated by a staff panel made up of a lieutenant, station captain, battalion chief and deputy chief. 
3.  Lieutenant: Evaluated by a staff panel made up of a captain, battalion chief, and deputy chief(s).

c.  Guidelines for allocation of points by chief. A chief may allocate up to ten (10) points for an average employee. A chief may allocate from ten (10) to thirty (30) points for employees who demonstrate excellent leadership skills and the ability to defuse or calm situations without the use of force. Further, this person must possess the desire to improve himself/herself and must have sought and received additional training/education outside of the minimum required by the department. Additionally, in allocating points, the chief may consider volunteer activities of the employee that have bettered the Pine Bluff community. 
d.  Failure of a chief of a department to follow guidelines. If serious allegations are made that a chief of a department has failed to follow the aforementioned guidelines, the mayor shall investigate and determine whether the guidelines have been followed. If it is determined that the guidelines were not followed in a particular instance, the mayor may limit or disallow the chief's points and the promotional period shall be complete with eighty-five (85) points being the maximum. In the event the chief's points are not completely eliminated, a pro-rata composite score will be used wherein the chief's points are diminished accordingly. 
(5)  Length of service-Promotional process. Candidates for promotion will be awarded .5 of one (1) point for each complete year of service, up to twenty (20) years, for a total of ten (10) points. 6 [] 
(6)  Final rating-Promotional process. Each competitor passing the examination shall be notified of his final rating as soon as is practicable after the rating has been completed. A competitor who fails the examination shall be notified of his failure. Any examinee shall be permitted to inspect his/her test in person in the chief's office by contacting the chief or his/her designee or in the offices of the Human Resources Department and shall be permitted to check his/her test with the answer sheet. A manifest error on the test shall be corrected if called to the attention of the chief, but such correction shall not invalidate any appointment previously made from such register; however the chief will make any required changes to the register based upon the corrective action taken. 
(e)  Eligible lists (applicant and promotional). 
(1)  Types of lists. Eligibility lists shall be of two (2) kinds: (1) entrance lists from which the original appointments shall be made and (2) promotion lists from which promotional appointments shall be made. These lists shall be made after each examination and at such times as the chief certifies the personnel. There shall be an appointment list for patrol positions in the police department and firefighter in the fire department. Promotion lists shall be established from time to time, as required. 
(2)  Duration of lists. All lists for appointment or promotion as kept by the chief with copies being maintained by the human resources department and shall be good for one (1) year from the date of certification. At the expiration of this period, all right of priority under the lists shall cease. However, when the chief believes it to be in the best interest of the city the chief may extend the validity of the appointment list for up to an additional year beyond the original year, for a total of not more than two (2) years. 
(3)  Chief's selection. The department head may select for appointment or promotion one (1) of the highest ranking of the three (3) on the respective list and notify the Mayor or his designee, the human resources department, and any other necessary city departments thereof. 
(4)  Order on list. The names of successful competitors shall be entered upon the appropriate list in order of their final rating by the chief. The original of this list shall be placed on file in the office of the respective chief as well as a copy being provided to the human resources department. 
(5)  Reinstatement to list. The name of any probationary or regular employee who is laid off because of lack of funds or curtailment of work or staff shall be returned to its former relative position on the list from which certification was made, provided such list has not expired or been exhausted. 
In the event a list has expired or been exhausted, the names of such regular or probationary employees shall be placed on re-employment list by classification and in order of lay-off. Upon re-establishment of the position, the employee last laid off shall be given preference in re-employment provided the position is the same classification he was in prior to the lay-off. 
(6)  Supplemental examinations. The chief's shall, from time to time, make a review of existing employment and promotional lists to determine whether there is an adequate number of eligible's available to meet the needs of the service. When it is determined by the chief's that a particular list is inadequate or will become inadequate in a short period of time, the chief(s) may order a supplemental examination for that class of positions. 
(f)  Removal of name from eligible lists. The chief may remove the name of an eligible from a list for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  The eligible declines appointment when offered to him/her under such conditions as he/she as indicated previously he/she would accept. 
(2)  The eligible cannot be located by the postal authorities. It shall be deemed impossible to so locate an eligible when communication mailed to him/her at his/her last known address is returned unclaimed.

(g)  Suspension of competition. In the case of a vacancy in a position requiring peculiar or exceptional qualifications of a scientific, professional, or expert character, upon satisfactory evidence that competition is impracticable and that the position can best be filled by the selection of some person designated who is of recognized attainment, the chief may, after being authorized by the mayor, suspend competition in that case. Suspension shall not be general in application but rather each case must be handled on its own merits and the finding of such necessity recorded in the records of the department. 
(h)  Temporary employees. In cases of emergency, temporary employees may be appointed by the department head of the police or fire department or his/her designee, without examination, and pending appointment from an eligible's list. A finding of an emergency and the reason therefore shall be placed in the records of the respective department. No temporary appointment shall continue longer than sixty (60) days, nor shall excessive temporary appointments be allowed, except in times of grave danger, of which the chief and mayor shall decide and make a record thereof. 
(i)  Re-employment of employees who left employment voluntarily. An employee (of either the fire department of police department) who has left his/her employment voluntarily shall be eligible for re-employment within twelve (12) months.

If the department head fails to carry out his duty, the employee shall automatically be removed from probationary status. If the department head fails to demote a promoted employee within the probationary period, then he/she shall be deemed to have completed his/her probationary period.

The employee shall have the right to be heard and to present information and documentation on his/her own behalf. No parties to the review shall be represented by counsel during the review committee's meeting(s). However, the appealing employee may have in attendance one (1) person of their choosing (minister, family member, doctor, friend, spouse, attorney, etc.) provided that person does not participate, in any way, in the review. The employee shall identify the attendee and provide the attendee's contact information to the review committee. The reasons concerning the suspension, reduction in pay and rank, or dismissal and the reply shall constitute a part of said review. Further, all parties to the review shall be given ample opportunity to respond to the opposing parties information and documentation. 
The employee shall be granted a review by the committee not more than fifteen (15) days after the request is made; provided, however, that the employee be notified of the date and place of said review ten (10) days prior to the date thereof. The chairman of the committee shall preside at the review and shall determine and decide all questions relative to the committee meeting. Upon completion of the review, the committee will have ten (10) days in which to issue and make its decision unless exceptional circumstances arise and in that instance the decision shall be rendered as soon as is possible. 
(2)  Scheduling the appeals review. 
a.  The human resources department will schedule a date for the committee to hear the review and give notice to the interested parties as required herein. Every effort will be made to schedule the review on the appealing employee's work time, but due to the periodic difficulty of convening such a meeting, this may not always be possible. In the event that the review is scheduled on the appealing employee's day off, they will not be paid for the time. 
b.  If the employee wishes to withdraw the request to review, the withdrawal must be made in writing and presented to the chief and the director of human resources. 
(3)  The appeals review. 
a.  The committee will hold a review that allows both parties to fully explain themselves. 
b.  At the close of the review the committee will adjourn the meeting and deliberate, and vote, in private. The committee will then reconvene and announce its decision. In no event shall the committee take longer than ten (10) days to make its decision. 
c.  Upon the concurrence of at least two (2) committee members, the committee may make one (1) of the following decisions regarding each matter before the committee: 
1.  That the disciplinary action be upheld as originally imposed; 
2.  That the discipline imposed be overturned and no other discipline be imposed; or, 
3.  That the discipline imposed be modified to impose another disciplinary action, whether less or more severe than the discipline originally imposed. 
d.  The committee's findings and recommendation(s), signed by all members, will be submitted to the mayor, chief, and the director of human resources. The committee will have the discretion to utilize the director of human resources (or designee) to assist in the preparation of the finding and recommendation document. 
(4)  Wrongful discipline-Remedies available.

(Ord. No. 6359, § 1(Ch. 7), 7-18-11) 
Sec. 19-137.1. - Assistant chief of police/deputy fire chief disciplinary appeals process. 
(a)  Uniformed employees who have been appointed to serve in the capacity of assistant chief of police/deputy fire chief shall be permitted to appeal disciplinary actions imposed by the respective chiefs, to the City Council of the City of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The city council may override the disciplinary action(s) by the respective chiefs, by two-thirds ( 2/3 ) majority of the total membership of the council vote. An appeal must be made in writing and filed with the city clerk no later than ten (10) days after the disciplinary action. 
(b)  The assistant chief of police/deputy fire chief will not be permitted to appeal disciplinary actions through the review committee, pursuant to section 6 [of Ordinance Number 6378]. 
(c)  This section in no way diminishes the authority of the respective chiefs to appoint or remove the assistant chief of police/deputy fire chief, except as specifically provided. 
(d)  In the event that an assistant chief police/deputy fire chief has been subjected to disciplinary action by the respective chief, this appeals process is available as long as his/her right to appeal under Ordinance Number 6359 has not expired, upon the passage of this section. 
(Ord. No. 6378, §§ 1-4, 2-13-12) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 6378, §§ 1-4, adopted Feb. 13, 2012, did not specifically amend the Code; therefore these provisions have been added as § 19-137.1 at the editor's discretion. Section 6, as referenced in subsection (b) above, states: "An appeal lodged in a timely manner and as provided in Section 1 shall be considered sufficient to secure review before the review committee authorized by Ordinance 6359, should this Ordinance be vetoed by the Mayor and the veto is not overridden by the City Council." 
Sec. 19-138. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  Leave of absence. Any request for an excused absence without pay for a period of twenty (20) work days or less may be granted by the police chief/fire chief and/or his/her designee without the necessity of preparing formal leave papers. Upon approval of the chief and the mayor, a leave of absence without pay may be granted for up to sixty (60) work days in any calendar year. Requests for such leave of absence shall be made in writing to the chief and the mayor and also filed by the requestor with the human resources department. Additional unpaid leave as an accommodation for qualified individuals with disabilities, who are unable to return from a medical leave within a specific time, will be considered on a case by case basis. This leave of absence policy is exclusive of any rights under the Family Medical Leave Act, or other federal or state law. 
    Since a leave of absence will impact upon the department's staffing availability to perform essential services, approval will be limited to extraordinary circumstances. Such application shall be made as far in advance as possible. 
(b)  Availability of city and department rules and regulations. City and departmental rules and regulations shall be available to all employees. Any employee who desires to review any rules and regulations may request from his supervisor permission to review same. The supervisor will make a copy available for review within a reasonable period of time from the request. 
(c)  Amending or changing rules and regulations. The Pine Bluff City Council is responsible for approving any additions, deletions and changes to these rules and regulations. The review committee may make recommendations for any such amendments. When doing so the review committee should submit their recommendations to the city's public safety committee and in turn the public safety committee, after review, will submit those recommendations and any other that may generated within the public safety committee, to the council as a whole. The chiefs of the police and fire departments, or their designees, shall make all city rules and regulations available to all departmental employees. 
(d)  Severability clause. If any provision of these policies, rules, and regulations or the application of any rule, regulation or circumstance is held invalid by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of these policies, rules and regulations which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end, the provisions of these regulations are declared to be severable. 
(e)  Emergency clause. Because the members of the civil service commission collectively tendered their resignations, effective June 16, 2011, the Pine Bluff Police Department and the Pine Bluff Fire Department employees are without recourse to address employment issues which may arise in their respective departments. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this article is in full force and effect from its passage and the order of dismissal is filed of record. 
(f)  Conflict clause. That all ordinances, resolutions, or parts thereof, in conflict with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of any conflict.

(a)  Any person or utility making an excavation in any paved or improved street or alley in the city shall notify the manager of the street department, provide the address for the excavation, and obtain a permit prior to making an excavation, unless it is an emergency excavation. In that event, a permit must be obtained by 9 a.m. the next working day. Failure to obtain a permit shall be a violation of section 24-31 and 24-32 and shall result in no further permits being issued to the person or utility company until said permit has been obtained. The person or utility company making the excavation shall make repairs for all excavations made in street right of ways and are responsible for keeping the excavations safe for the motoring public. The person or utility company making the excavation shall be responsible for barricading the excavation and maintaining the barricades until the site is completely repaired. In making an excavation, any person or utility company subject thereto, whether public or private, shall abide by all rules and regulations of the Occupational Safety Hazards Act (OSHA) and the Department of Labor concerning personal safety and proper set up of work zones, safety signs (advance warning five hundred (500) feet, men and equipment working, and end construction) and provision of flaggers while working in street right of ways. The person or utility company making the initial cut shall be responsible for filling it and maintaining barricades until they have permanently repaired the cut. 
(b)  Where such improved streets or alleys are cut, the dirt shall be hauled away and the trench shall be backfilled with Bab or SB-2 crushed stone, preferably Bab. The fill material shall be saturated so as to obtain maximum settlement instantaneously. The trench shall be filled to the top with the fill material. After the fill material has been watered down and settled, the person making the excavation shall call the street manager or his representative for an inspection of the trench. If the trench is approved by the street manager or his representative, the person who made the excavation will be instructed to proceed with the repairs of the improved street or alley in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Repairs shall be made in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Concrete pavements. The width of replaced concrete shall be at least twelve (12) inches wider than the trench width so as to allow at least six (6) inches overlap of slab over trench walls. The replaced concrete shall be reinforced with double layer six (6) inches by six (6) inches, ten-gauge wire mesh or three-eighths-inch round reinforced rods spaced on ten-inch centers both ways. The thickness of the concrete shall match the existing thickness and in no instance shall be less than six (6) inches thick. The finished concrete shall conform to proper grade and alignment. 
(2)  Asphalt pavements. All excavations shall be filled to proper grade and alignment with concrete. 
a.  After the trench has been inspected and accepted, six (6) inches of suitable material, as specified in (b) above, shall be taken out of the trench. Six (6) inches of reinforced concrete shall be placed on the suitable material. The replaced concrete shall conform to the same requirements as outlined in item (1) of this subsection. 
b.  In cases where the excavation is made in, and approximately parallel with, an improved street or alley, the city engineer may authorize filling of the top six (6) inches of the trench with a material other than concrete (such as SB2). After such material has been compacted in a manner acceptable to the street manager, two (2) inches of hot mix or cold asphalt shall be placed on the fill material so as to conform to the proper grade and alignment. 
(3)  Bab or crushed stone streets. After the trench has been inspected and approved, twelve (12) inches of the fill material shall be taken out and replaced with compacted Bab or SB2 crushed stone. 
(d)  If any person makes an excavation during the day, he must fill the trench with acceptable fill material immediately after the improvement has been laid and inspected. This will eliminate the hazards involved with having an open trench for a long period of time. 
(e)  If it becomes necessary for any city employee to answer a call concerning any excavation between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., the person responsible for such excavation shall pay to the city the sum of forty dollars ($40.00) per call. 
(f)  In order to minimize the damage done to streets and/or alleys, no excavations will be made in any improved street or alley during inclement weather. The street manager or his representative shall determine when any excavation is permissible. 
(g)  Fee schedule: 
(1)  Permit fee-Fifteen dollars ($15.00) per address for excavation(s), utility cuts, boring, curb cut or driveway installation. 
(2)  Block permit fee-Continuous longitudinal cuts of more than fifty (50) feet, or five (5) or more cuts in a single block shall be treated as a block permit with a fee of ninety-seven dollars and fifty cents ($97.50) per block. The block permit fee shall be in lieu of individual permits within the block. 
(3)  Inspection fee-Twenty-two dollars and fifty cents ($22.50) per permit plus applicable permit fee.

Sec. 24-39. - Supervision of work. 
    The work of replacing all pavements as herein provided in this article shall be done under the supervision and direction, and to the satisfaction, of the street manager or his representative, and the street manager or his representative shall prescribe by regulations the manner of such refilling. 
(Code 1967, § 34-30) 
Sec. 24-40. - Backfill material specifications; care of work. 
(a)  Backfill materials used in all replacements should be selected materials, a sample of which has been approved by the street manager or his representative. The backfilling shall be done in a workmanlike manner. 
(b)  The person responsible for improved street and alley excavations shall be responsible for excess fill dirt, dust or any foreign matter caused by such excavation. The person that has made an excavation shall control such items by whatever means that are necessary in order to preserve the health, safety and peace of the citizens of the city. 
(Code 1967, § 34-34) 
Sec. 24-41. - Safety. 
    All excavations shall be properly barricaded and lighted sufficiently to give due and proper notice to all persons of the excavation. The person making each excavation shall properly barricade and light such excavation and maintain such lights and barricades.

(Code 1967, § 34-36) 
Sec. 24-43. - Final repair of pavement after excavation. 
    Final repairs must be made within forty-five (45) days of the excavation and must be warranted for a period of one year. Any repaired excavation which deteriorates or becomes faulty during the one-year period must be replaced by the person or utility company having made the excavation. Failure to make final repairs within the allotted forty-five (45) days shall result in an additional charge of five dollars ($5.00) per day to the person or utility company until the final repairs have been made. All final repairs must be made with 3,500 PSI concrete. 
    Materials removed while cutting and digging the excavation site to make repairs may not be used to refill any area that is part of the asphalted street or part of a concrete driving lane or driveway and shall be removed from the excavation site the same day the excavation is made and disposed of in a proper manner. In making an excavation, the flowline of any ditch at the site may not be impeded. Dirt must be replaced and landscaped back to the original flowline and condition and any private property affected must be repaired and landscaped to its condition prior to the excavation. 
    Excavations must be back-filled by the utility company with a select material, to wit: sand up to the top of the pipe, no higher, compacted with SB-2, Babs, or flowable fill from the top of the pipe to street elevation in six-inch lifts.

Sec. 24-96. - Street naming system. 
    There is hereby established a uniform system of street naming in the address service area of the city and all streets, avenues, and other public and private ways shall be named in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(1)  A street or other public roadway running in the same direction and having an angular deviation of not more than ninety (90) degrees for a distance of not more than three hundred fifty (350) feet, shall carry the same name unless special circumstances make such a plan impracticable or not feasible. 
(2)  Street names shall not be duplicated within the address service area.

(4)  The city council may adopt further designations or any additional rules and regulations which may be required from time to time upon recommendations of the planning commission by amending this section. 
(Ord. No. 5335, § 11, 9-5-89) 
Sec. 24-97. - Transitional guidelines. 
    For the purpose of clarifying and systematizing the present street naming pattern in the address service area and to implement the application of the matters set forth in section 24-96, there is hereby adopted the following plan: 
(1)  The planning commission, coordinating with the Southeast Arkansas Regional Planning Commission, is hereby authorized to prepare and present to the city council a recommendation for the naming of all unnamed streets, avenues, and public and private ways within the address service area of the city and to propose new names to eliminate duplications and sound-alike street names. 
(2)  Guidelines for renaming existing streets may be used as criteria when considering the changing of a duplicate or sound-alike street name: 
a.  Does one (1) street have any historical reason for its name? 
b.  Which street has the least number of structures on it and thus would require the least number of address changes? 
c.  Which street has had its name for the longest period of time? 
d.  Is the name and thoroughfare designation suffix appropriate according to other street names in the neighborhood? 
e.  Which street name is used for the longest distance or the most traveled section? 
Priorities can be established by numerically weighing the importance of these items. Streets with the highest total number would be given priority for name retention. 
(3)  Developers of property are encouraged to propose street names on plats containing new streets under the guidelines of this article. All such names are subject to review by the planning commission for compliance with this article.

(2)  Local streets. The developer shall pay the entire cost of constructing all local streets. 
(3)  Collector streets. The developer shall construct collector streets as part of the subdivision. 
(4)  Boundary streets. 
a.  Existing streets. When the proposed subdivision abuts upon an existing paved street that does not have curb and gutter, the developer shall install these improvements to the satisfaction of the planning commission. 
b.  New streets. New boundary streets that are platted for the primary purpose of providing traffic routes into and through the subdivision shall be constructed by the developer as part of the subdivision development. 
(5)  Marginal access streets (service or frontage). The developer shall pay the entire cost of construction of marginal access streets. 
(6)  Arterial streets. All arterial street design and construction as shown on the master street plan may be handled on a participation basis. 
(7)  Half streets. Half streets are streets that border a subdivision or a tract of undeveloped land. When this situation arises, the developer is only required to dedicate half the right-of-way and construct half the street improvements. Half streets (local streets) should be discouraged by designing the subdivision where this situation will not occur. When in the opinion of the planning commission, a half street cannot be avoided through the use of design considerations, the developer shall be required to dedicate half of the street improvements, particularly if the adjacent property has the potential to be subdivided at a later date. Half street improvements and dedications (collector and arterial streets), when required in the master street plan, shall be provided by the developer. 
(b)  Street signs. The developer shall pay for street signs and their installation. The city will install the signs. 
(c)  Sidewalks. The developer shall pay for all sidewalks that may be required by the planning commission. 
(d)  Sewage collection and treatment system. The developer shall pay all costs of the sewage collection and treatment system, except oversized collector lines which the city requires for future development of the area. 
(1)  The city may require larger lines than are necessary to serve the subdivision in order to provide for future development of the area. In the event that such larger lines are required, the developer may be entitled to participating aid from the city on such oversized lines. 
(2)  An eight-inch nominal inside diameter sewer line has been established by the city as the minimum size of sewer line for purposes of determining the extent of participating aid from the city. The city will only participate in the cost of sewer lines which are sized larger than eight (8) inches for reasons of providing for future development. This does not apply to lines sized larger than eight (8) inches for the purpose of serving future sections of the same subdivision. 
(e)  Storm drainage system. The developer shall pay all costs of the drainage system except that the city may participate in the cost of oversized drainage facilities designed to service a larger drainage area than that actually being subdivided. 
(f)  All other costs. The developer shall pay all other costs that are not specifically covered by this section. 
(Subdivision Regulations, § IX) 
Sec. 25-88. - Construction standards.

(4)  The special requirements of the regulations and rules of the health department and/or appropriate state agencies. 
(5)  The rules of the state highway department if the subdivision on any lot contained therein abuts a state highway or connecting street. 
(6)  Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with the above guides on policy and purposes of these regulations in section 25-1. 
(Subdivision Regulations, § VIII(B)) 
Sec. 25-91. - Construction plans and specifications. 
(a)  Generally. Prior to the construction of any streets and utilities, the developer shall furnish two (2) complete sets of plans and specifications for such construction to the city engineer. These documents shall be transmitted in writing. These plans and specifications will be reviewed for conformity with this chapter and the city standards.

Sec. 28-47. - Extension of sewer facilities. 
    The following procedure is to be followed by any individual, firm, partnership, association or corporation developing an area, subdivision or addition after herein referenced to as a sponsor, seeking sewer extension for expansion approval for the sanitary sewer system of the City of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. 
(1)  Sponsor shall make a preliminary, written application to the wastewater utility for the proposed sewer extension or expansion. The application shall include in detail the following basic information. 
a.  A map of the area to be served by the extension or expansion. 
b.  A statement as to how many services will be connected within the area when the project is completed and shall indicate how many connections are expected to be connected by the time the area served is completely developed. 
c.  If the application has any unusual circumstances or special conditions, the wastewater utility staff may take the application before the utility commission for final approval. 
(2)  After (1) above has been satisfied, the sponsor is required to submit plans and specifications as required by the Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility. 
(3)  If the area to be served by the sewer extension or expansion is not located within the city limits of the City of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, the expansion will not be permitted to connect to the existing system until the wastewater utility receives verification from the planning department that the entire area has been annexed into the city limits. The only area where connections are permitted outside the city limits is homes located within the following subdivision: Westchester (in the City of White Hall). 
(4)  In cases where an application for extension or expansion is given approval by the wastewater utility and actual work on the project has not started within six (6) months from the date of such approval, approval shall be cancelled unless good cause for the failure to begin construction is presented to the wastewater utility. 
(5)  If the sponsor is required to build a sewer line larger than required to serve the area that is being developed for the purpose of serving other areas, then and, and in that event, the wastewater utility may enter into a written agreement whereby the differential in the total construction cost will be determined and a person outside of the area developed by the sponsor may be compelled to pay his prorated share of the additional cost of the line to the wastewater utility before tying onto the new line. The wastewater utility shall retain all such payments and, at a designated time during the year, it shall make a remittance to the sponsor of the amount collected from persons minus a five (5) percent service charge from those who have tied onto the line outside of the area developed by the sponsor. The remittance shall be made once a year for a ten-year period. In no event may the original sponsor collect an amount greater than the amount specified as the differential cost for the larger line. 
(6)  In connection with the sewer extension application, the wastewater utility will review and consider the effect of the proposed extension in relation to its effect on the existing system and its workability insofar as the Master Plan is concerned. 
(7)  A sewer connection is permitted only when a sewer main is adjacent to the property to be served by the proposed connection. All sewer connections shall be made in accordance with current city ordinances. In no case shall a service line extend into a street, alley or right-of-way for a distance greater than the width of the street, alley or right-of-way. 
(8)  Where a sewer extension or expansion to the Pine Bluff wastewater system is constructed under the provisions of this document and the cost of said extension or expansion is paid for entirely by the sponsor, the wastewater utility will not charge a connection fee to anyone who connects to the said extension or expansion for a period of three (3) years from the date that the final "as-built" plans are approved and the system accepted by the utility commission. After the three-year period, anyone connecting to the extension or expansion will pay a connection fee as set by ordinance.

After the three-year period, anyone connecting to the extension or expansion will pay a connection fee as set by this section. 
(c)  In no case is anyone permitted other than the wastewater utility to collect any connection fees. A sewer connection is permitted only when a sewer main is adjacent to the property to be served by the proposed connection. In no case shall a service line extend into a street, alley or right-of-way for a distance greater than the width of the street, alley or right-of-way.

The wastewater utility shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations in order to prove that the discharger is in compliance and their monitoring facilities are properly maintained. 
(b)  When required by the wastewater utility the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the wastewater utility. The manhole shall be installed by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the downstream manhole provided it only conveys wastewater originating from the industry's premises. 
(c)  When directed to do so by the wastewater utility, any discharger discharging industrial or other wastes shall at his expenses, obtain a representative sample of his wastewater and have the appropriate physical, chemical, and biological tests performed on this sample by a qualified testing laboratory acceptable to the wastewater utility. The purpose of such tests shall be to determine the conformance of the wastewater characteristics to this division. A report shall be made in writing to the wastewater utility by the laboratory stating the results of the tests. 
(d)  At any time, the superintendent may sample any industrial or other discharge and conduct analyses to determine the concentrations of any chemical, physical or biological parameter. If the sampling and analysis performed by the superintendent indicates any of the parameters are in excess of the established limits, the superintendent shall compute a surcharge as set by ordinance, and the owner shall be liable for payment of the amount thereof. The amount thereof shall be considered a sewer charge for which the owner shall be liable in accordance with the provisions of A.C.A. § 14-235-223, and upon default in such payment, the wastewater utility shall be entitled to those remedies set forth in such section. 
(e)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Association, or EPA-approved procedures and shall be taken at the control manholes. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, property, and the environment. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. 
(f)  All industrial users under a compliance schedule are expected to self-monitor its wastewater discharge at a frequency set by the wastewater utility. 
(g)  The wastewater utility will conduct at least one inspection and sampling visit annually for each significant industrial user.

(Ord. No. 6191, § 9, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-160. - Prohibitions and permissible discharge. 
(a)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited. The following is a partial list, provided for informational purposes only, of common substances which are illicit discharges when allowed to enter a public drainage control system: Solid waste, human and animal waste, antifreeze, oil, gasoline, grease and all other automotive and petroleum products, flammable or explosive materials, metals in excess of naturally occurring amounts whether in liquid or solid form, chemicals not normally found in uncontaminated water, solvents and degreasers, painting products, drain cleaners, commercial and household cleaning materials, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, acids, alkalis, ink, steam-cleaning waste, laundry waste, soap, detergent, ammonia, chlorine, swimming pool or hot tub water, domestic or sanitary sewage, animal carcasses, food and food waste, yard waste, dirt, sand and gravel, and commercial car wash discharge water. 
(b)  Permissible discharges. The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: Water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater de-watering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if de-chlorinated-typically less than one (1) PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
(c)  Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 6191, § 10, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-161. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The program administrator may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition in writing the Pine Bluff City Council for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(Ord. No. 6191, § 11, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-162. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the program administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 6191, § 12, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-163. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, and construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. The program administrator shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
Facility operators shall allow the program administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
The program administrator shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
The program administrator shall have the right to require the discharge to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the program administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
Unreasonable delays in allowing the program administrator access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
If the program administrator has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 6191, § 13, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-164. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    The City of Pine Bluff requires best management practices (BMP's) for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a residential, commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 6191, § 14, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-165. - Watercourse protection. 
    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other deleterious materials that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly degrade the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 6191, § 15, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-166. - Notification of spills or releases. 
    Not withstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency responses for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the United States said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city program administrator within five (5) business days of the phone notice. 
(Ord. No. 6191, § 16, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 28-167. - Enforcement. 
    Notice of violation. Whenever the program administrator finds that an organization has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation: 
 The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
 The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
 That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
 The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;

DIVISION 2. - MUNICIPAL STORMWATER CONTROL FEE[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 6343, §§ 1-3, adopted Jan. 18, 2011, did not specifically amend the Code; therefore, these provisions have been included as Div. 2, §§ 28-181-28-183, at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 28-181. - Findings. 
    The city council finds and determines: 
(1)  That federal law and regulation require the city to provide for a system of collecting, treatment and disposal of stormwater runoff in order to combat water pollution; 
(2)  That stormwater can carry contaminants such as plastic bags, detergents, nutrients, heavy metals and pollution which can be harmful to the environment. In addition erosion can contribute to the contaminants contained in stormwater runoff, as well as damage residential and commercial property; 
(3)  That aging or inadequate designed infrastructure designed to carry stormwater can result in flooding during major storm events and that debris swept into ditches and waterways during storm events can prevent the proper movement of storm water, adding to flood risks; 
(4)  That adoption of a minimal flat fee to be paid by owners of realty by remittance with the monthly water charge, rather than a fee based on "equivalent rate units" relating to the "impervious area" of a parcel, or based on square footage, is the simplest, most expeditious means to defray the cost of compliance with the federal law and regulations; 
(5)  That the fee assessed by this division, is, in the vast majority of cases, less than the fee would be if based on impervious area or square footage; 
(6)  That the collection of the fee is most cost efficient and convenient through it being included as part of the monthly water statement to each user by United Water of Arkansas; and 
(7)  That United Water of Arkansas should be permitted to assess an administration fee for the collection and remittance of the fee to the city. 
(Ord. No. 6343, § 1, 1-18-11) 
Sec. 28-182. - Fee assessed/penalty for refusal to pay. 
(a)  There is hereby assessed against all water users in the city of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, a monthly fee of seventy-nine cents ($0.79) per water meter (nine dollars and forty-three cents ($9.43) per annum), to be itemized separately on the water statement provided by United Water of Arkansas, and which shall be designated, "Municipal Storm Water Control Fee. 
(b)  All municipal storm water control fees collected by United Water of Arkansas, less any administrative fee agreed to between the city and United Water, shall be remitted to the city no later than the month following collection. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful to refuse to pay the municipal stormwater control fee. Any entity or person convicted of failing to pay the fee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined no less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per occurrence, or sentenced to the county jail for no more than ten (10) days, or both. 
(Ord. No. 6343, § 2, 1-18-11; Ord. No. 6555, § 1, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 28-183. - Use of fees collected. 
(a)  Fees collected pursuant to this division shall be used exclusively by the City of Pine Bluff for the purpose of paying all components and activities of the stormwater management and water quality program. 
(b)  The finance department shall create a separate budget line item accounting for funds collected and shall ensure that expenditures from the funds are in compliance with the purposes of this division.

Those standards, if more stringent than the limitations imposed by the latest approved "Technically Based Local Limits Development Document" for sources in that sub-category, shall supersede the limitations imposed by the local limits. 
(1)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. In accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c)(2). 
(2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(3)  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section 28-212 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7). 
(4)  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the manager within two (2) business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the manager of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. See CFR 403.6(c)(9).

Sec. 28-214. - Specific pollutant limitations (local limits). 
    No person shall discharge any waters or wastes at a concentration that would exceed the concentration of pollutants, including but not limited to, those concentrations identified in the "Technically Based Local Limits Development Document", and adopted by the manager of the Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility and approved by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality. 
    Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility will develop and assign specific discharge permit limitations, or Best Management Practice (BMP), when deemed appropriate by the manager, for pollutants for permitted users based on criteria approved by the manager. The specific permit limits or BMP shall ensure that local limit pollutant concentrations will protect the wastewater treatment plant. The local limits shall apply to the total flow, total process discharge from the industrial users or to another discharge location at the discretion of the manager. In developing specific permit limits, the manager may impose mass local limitations in addition to, or in place of, specific local concentration-based limits. In addition, Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility may develop specific discharge limitations, or BMP for any pollutants which the manager of Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility may determine to be of sufficient quantity to cause POTW interference and/or pass-through, endanger the health and safety of the POTW personnel or the public health, cause a POTW permit violation or render the POTW sludges unacceptable for economic reuse or reclamation.

Sec. 28-341. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of forces beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 6381, § 13.1, 2-21-12) 
Sec. 28-342. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 28-211(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in subsections 28-211(b)(1) through (b)(16) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the manager at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the manager determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

DIVISION 14. - EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGE RATES 

Sec. 28-351. - General. 
    The manager may at any time collect appropriate samples from any industrial or commercial user's discharge and conduct analyses to determine the concentrations of BOD/COD, TSS, pH, and oil and grease (O&G). If the sampling and analyses performed by the manager or his designated assistant indicates concentrations of BOD/COD, TSS, and O&G exceeding the limits set forth in section 28-352 below, he shall compute an extra strength surcharge as set by the existing Sewer Rate Ordinance, and the owner shall be liable for payment of the amount thereof. The collection of an extra strength surcharge is not a penalty, but rather allows Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility to defray the costs of treating industrial wastewater concentrations that are above average domestic wastewater concentrations. The surcharge shall be considered a sewer charge for which the owner shall be liable in accordance with the applicable law of the State of Arkansas, as amended and upon default in such payment, Pine Bluff Wastewater Utility shall be entitled to those remedies set forth in said statute. 
(Ord. No. 6381, § 14.1, 2-21-12) 
Sec. 28-352. - Computations. 
    In accordance with requirements in this chapter of the City of Pine Bluff Code of Ordinances and rates as amended by Ordinance Number 6146 dated August 1, 2005, the permittee must pay a surcharge when wastewater exceeds the allowable base established in the ordinance and such surcharge shall be computed on the following formula: 
(1)  BOD in excess of 300 mg/L. 
(2)  TSS in excess of 300 mg/L. 
(3)  O&G in excess of 100 mg/L. 
SURCHARGE = V × 8.34 [0.1325 (BOD-300) plus 0.0404 (TSS-300) plus 0.0675 (O&G-100)]  
Where: 
V = Volume of wastewater in million gallons per month 8.34 = 8.34 (lb/million gallons)/(liter) 0.1325 = Unit charge for BOD in dollars per pound 0.0404 = Unit charge for TSS in dollars per pound 0.0675 = Unit charge for O&G in dollars per pound  
    In accordance with Sewer Use Ordinance Number 6146, the permittee must pay a monitoring charge. This charge is based on the volume of wastewater discharged by the permittee and the monitoring conducted during the month. 
    A permit fee determined by the manager will be assessed to the permittee. This fee must be paid in full prior to the issuance of this permit. This fee does not include cost of reissuance of this permit due to revocation, wastewater service termination, or new ownership of a company. 
Special Purpose Users 
    All special purpose users (leachate, contaminated groundwater producers, temporary disposal sites, etc.) must obtain a permit to discharge into the local sewer system. This permit must be approved by the manager or designated wastewater utility representative. All special purpose users will be regulated in accordance with the pretreatment program requirements and the local sewer use ordinance. 
    All special purpose users shall be charged the following rates listed below provided the user has agreed to discharge monthly: 
Monthly Volume Charge ($/CCF) Tier 1 Permit cycle less than five (5) years $90.00 Tier 2 Permit cycle less than ten (10) years 60.00 Tier 3 Two (2) standard permit cycles of ten (10) years or greater 40.00 *Long term discharger (ten (10) years or greater).  
    The user must have two (2) standard permit cycles with the utility and a monthly average volume of one hundred thousand (100,000) gallons. If the quantity after a yearly average should be reduced to less than one hundred thousand (100,000) gallons/month, the previous tier shall apply to the discharger. 
    In addition, the user shall pay for all sampling, testing, and administrative costs to determine if the utility will accept the wastewater for treatment. The utility shall determine the location at which the special purpose users' wastewater will be accepted.

Upon denial of an application, no subsequent application for a permit with reference to the same property or part thereof, for the same use of the property, regardless of modifications to the scope of the original application, shall be filed by any applicant until the expiration of one (1) year after the denial. A subsequent application for a permit with reference to the same property or part thereof, but for a different use, may be filed following the expiration of three (3) months after the denial.

Sec. 29-51. - Right to continue; exceptions. 
    The lawful use of any building, structure or land existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter may be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter. Provided, however, the right to continue such nonconforming uses shall be subject to regulations prohibiting the creation of a nuisance and shall terminate when inappropriate use of the premises produces a condition which constitutes a nuisance. The right of nonconforming uses to continue shall be subject to such regulations as the maintenance of the premises and conditions of operations as may, in the judgment of the board of zoning adjustment, be reasonably required for protection of adjacent property and further, the right to the specific regulations herein contained. In the case of a business use the right to continue its nonconformity is contingent upon the operator obtaining a current occupation license.

    The planning commission, after a public hearing, may grant an R-PUD permit when it finds that the R-PUD proposal is consistent with good general planning practice, consistent with good site planning, can be operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted developments and uses in the district, is visually compatible with the permitted uses in the surrounding area, and is deemed desirable to promote the general welfare of the city. There shall be no minimum height or setback requirements within the development other than provided herein. Those heights and set- backs shown on the approved plan shall become the minimum requirements. 
    The granting of an R-PUD permit shall be initiated by the filing of a verified application by one (1) or more of the owners or authorized representatives of the property sought to be used for the R-PUD proposal. Application shall be addressed to the zoning department and filed in its public office upon forms and accompanied by such data and information as may be prescribed for that purpose by the planning commission so as to assure the fullest practicable presentation of facts for the permanent record and for adequate preliminary consideration of the proposal. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days of acceptance of the application with the procedure required for any other public hearing before the planning commission. If the planning commission gives preliminary approval to the application, the matter shall be forwarded to the city council together with the approval for consideration by that body. 
    If the application is approved by the city council, the matter shall be returned to the planning commission for consideration of a final development plan, which shall be prepared by the applicant and submitted to the planning commission for approval within one hundred and sixty (160) days after the application was approved by the city council. Upon approval of a final development plan by the planning commission, the plan shall be recorded with the county recorder as an R-PUD, and a permit for development in conformity with the recorded plan shall be issued to the applicant by the director of planning or his agent. No building permit shall be issued by the city for construction of any structure on the tract of land involved that is not in conformity with the recorded R-PUD plan. Unless otherwise stated, substantial work or construction under the permit must be commenced within eighteen (18) months, or the permit shall terminate. If the permit is not reinstated within a period of six (6) months from the date the permit becomes null and void, the city council may order the R-PUD to be vacated. 
    The planning commission shall, in the instance of every application submitted under this regulation, especially consider architectural, landscape and other relationships, which may exist between the proposed development and the character of the surrounding neighborhood and shall prescribe and require such physical treatment or other limitations as will, in its opinion, enhance the neighborhood character. 
    Height limitations for structures may be modified by the planning commission, with respect to any structure proposed in an application for an R-PUD permit if the normal requirements for open areas on the premises are modified as follows: Any residential structure exceeding three (3) stories in height or thirty-five (35) feet shall be set back from all R-PUD boundary lines at least one (1) additional foot for each foot of height above thirty-five (35) feet above the average finished floor level (FFL) at the perimeter of such structure. 
    Setbacks along boundary lines of an R-PUD, and off-street parking requirements applicable in any district shall in no event be diminished by the planning commission, but the planning commission may require that open parking areas be screened by walls, fences, or plant material, or by both methods in order to preserve or complement the general character of any existing developments on adjacent properties. 
    The planning commission may explicitly impose special conditions relating to any development under this section. These conditions may relate to, but need not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Conditions relative to the type and extent of improvements and landscaping. 
(2)  Conditions concerning development, improvements, and maintenance of common ground. 
(3)  Conditions relative to the maximum or minimum gross floor area per dwelling unit.

(5)  In development wherein open spaces, recreational areas or other common lands are provided, the acreage of which is included in the available gross acreage used in the determination of the maximum number of allowable dwelling units in the development, such common land shall be conveyed by the developer in fee simple absolute title by warranty deed to a board of trustees. The trustee shall make provisions by trust indenture for the sole benefit, use, and enjoyment of the lot owners, present and future, or each subdivision authorized under the R-PUD procedure, for term of years certain. The term of years certain shall extend for a period of at least twenty (20) years, or for the duration of the subdivision or development, whichever period of time is less. Thereafter, fee simple absolute title shall vest in the then lot owners or owners of other real property as joint tenants. The rights of the joint tenants shall only be exercisable appurtenant to and in conjunction with their lot ownership or ownership of other real property. Any conveyance or change of ownership of any lot or other real property shall convey with it ownership in the common property. No lot owner or owner of other real property shall have the right to convey his interest in the common property except as an incident of the ownership of a regularly platted lot. Ownership of other real property in the development shall carry with it all the incidents of ownership of the common property although such is not expressly mentioned in the deed; provided, however, that no right of power conferred upon the trustees shall be revoked. Warranty deeds and trust indentures complying with the aforementioned provisions shall have attached thereto a written legal opinion prepared and signed by an attorney licensed to practice law in the state, setting forth the attorney's legal opinion as to the legal form and effect of the deeds and trust indentures. The deeds and indentures shall be approved by the city attorney as to legal form and filed with the county recorder simultaneously with the recording of the final subdivision plat or development plan. 
    At the option of the applicant, R-PUD may include land designated for dedication for public school or public park use, which land may be considered part of the gross acreage of the development in computing the maximum number of lots that may be created or dwelling units that may be authorized, provided that: 
(1)  The area of the proposed R-PUD is at least sixty (60) acres in the case of public school dedication and thirty (30) acres in the case of a public park dedication and thus the dedication is approved by the appropriate school board or park commission. 
(2)  The proposed R-PUD is recommended for approval by the planning commission and is approved by the city council. 
(c)  Appeal. Upon the disapproval by the planning commission of an application for an R-PUD, the applicant may file an appeal with the city council requesting a determination from that body. A notice of appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days after the planning commission's report is received by the city council at a regular meeting. Notice of appeal to the city council shall be in writing and shall be filed in duplicate with the city clerk accompanied by a fee of seventy-five dollars ($75.00). The applicant shall have an additional thirty (30) days to file the appeal. The appeal shall set forth specifically wherein the application or the final development plan is consistent with good general planning practice, good site planning, can be operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted developments and uses in the district, is visually compatible with the permitted uses in the surrounding area, and is desirable to promote the general welfare of the city. 
    Upon receipt of an appeal, the city council shall confer with the planning commission. The planning commission shall report thereon to the city council, detailing the relevant facts and considerations of the application. The city council may then affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, any determination of the planning commission or may approve or disapprove any application upon which the planning commission has taken action. A majority vote of the whole city council shall be sufficient to affirm, reverse, modify, or amend any determination of the planning commission.

Sec. 29-113. - CI-PUD commercial-industrial planned unit development. 
(a)  General description and intent. This section applies to the CI-PUD commercial-industrial planned unit development district. The purpose of this section is to provide an innovative, voluntary and alternate zoning procedure in the B commercial and I industrial districts in order to permit minor flexibility in commercial and industrial uses beyond that permitted in the particular districts, under conditions of approved site and development plans. 
(b)  Requirements. Any B commercial or I industrial district may be designated as a planned unit development provided that approval is obtained for a commercial or industrial PUD permit in compliance with the procedure in this section. 
    The planning commission, after a public hearing, may grant a commercial or industrial PUD permit when it finds that the commercial or industrial PUD proposal: 
(1)  Is consistent with good planning practice and good site planning; 
(2)  There is a direct relationship or linkage between the use or uses for which a permit is sought and an existing permitted use in the district in which the use is to be located; 
(3)  Can be operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted developments and uses in the district. 
In addition it must be visually compatible with the permitted uses providing it meets the above criteria. 
    The granting of a commercial and industrial PUD permit shall be initiated by the filing of a verified application by one (1) or more of the owners or authorized representatives of the owners of the property sought to be used for the commercial or industrial PUD proposal. Applications shall be addressed to the planning commission and filed in the city zoning official's office upon forms supplied by the city zoning official's office and accompanied by such data and information as may be prescribed for that purpose by the planning commission so as to assure the fullest practicable presentation of facts for the permanent record and for adequate preliminary consideration of the proposal. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the application consistent with the procedure required for any other public hearing before the planning commission. If the planning commission gives preliminary approval to the application, the matter shall be forwarded to the city council together with the approved plans for consideration by that body. If the application is approved by the city council, the matter shall be returned to the planning commission for consideration of a final development plan, which shall be prepared by the applicant and submitted to the planning commission for approval within one hundred twenty (120) days after the application was approved by the city council. Upon approval of a final development plan by the planning commission, the plan shall be recorded with the county recorder as a commercial and industrial PUD plan, and a permit shall be issued to the applicant by the director of planning. No building permit shall be issued by the city for construction of any structure on the tract of land involved that is not a conformity with the recorded commercial and industrial PUD permit. Unless otherwise stated, substantial work or construction under the permit must commence within a period of six (6) months from the date the permit was issued or it becomes null and void. The city council may order the commercial and industrial PUD permit to be vacated in this event. 
    The planning commission shall, in the instance of every application submitted under this regulation, consider architectural, landscape and other relationships, which may exist between the proposed development and the character of the surrounding neighborhood and shall prescribe and require such physical treatment or other limitations as will, in its opinion, preserve the neighborhood character. 
    Off-street parking requirements as reflected in article V, division 2 shall in no event be diminished by the planning commission, but the planning commission may require that open parking areas be screened by walls, fences, or plant material in order to preserve or complement the general character of any existing developments on adjacent properties. 
    The planning commission may explicitly impose special conditions relating to any development under this section. These conditions may relate to, but need not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Conditions relative to the type and extent of improvements and landscaping. 
(2)  Conditions concerning development, improvements and maintenance of common ground. 
(3)  Conditions relative to the maximum or minimum gross floor area per unit. 
(4)  Conditions relating to height and area requirements. 
(5)  In developments wherein open spaces, recreational areas, or other common lands are provided, the acreage of which is included in the available gross acreage used in the determination of the maximum number of allowable building square feet in the development, the common land shall be conveyed by the developer in fee simple absolute title by warranty deed to a board of trustees. The trustees shall make provisions by trust indenture for the sole benefit, use and enjoyment of the lot owners, present and future, of each subdivision or development, whichever period of time is less. Thereafter fee simple absolute title shall vest in the then lot owner or owners of other real property as joint tenants. The rights of the joint tenants shall only be exercisable appurtenant to and in conjunction with their lot ownership or ownership of other real property. Any conveyance or change of ownership of any lot or other real property shall convey with it ownership in the common property. No lot owner or owner of other real property shall have the right to convey his interest in the common property except as an incident of the ownership of a regularly platted lot or ownership of other real property in the development. The sale of any lot or other real property in the development shall carry with it all the incidents of ownership of the common property although such is not expressly mentioned in the deed, provided, however, that no right or power conferred upon the trustees shall be revoked. Warranty deeds and trust indentures complying with the aforementioned provisions shall have attached thereto a written legal opinion prepared and signed by the attorney licensed to practice law in the state setting forth the attorney's legal opinion as to the legal form and affect of the deeds and trust indentures. The deeds and indentures shall be approved by the city attorney as to legal form and filed with the county recorder simultaneously with the recording of the final subdivision plat or development plan. 
(c)  Appeal. Upon the disapproval by the planning commission of an application for a commercial and industrial PUD permit, the applicant may file an appeal with the city council requesting a determination from that body. A notice of appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days after the planning commission's report is received by the city council at a regular meeting. Notice of appeal to the city council shall be in writing and shall be filed in duplicate with the city clerk accompanied by a fee of seventy-five dollars ($75.00). The applicant shall have an additional thirty (30) days to file the appeal. The appeal shall set forth specifically wherein the application or the final development plan is consistent with good general planning, good site planning, the nature of the direct relationship or linkage between the use for which a permit is sought and an existing permitted use in the district in which the use is to be located, can be operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted developments and uses in the district, is visually compatible with the permitted uses in the surrounding area, and is desirable to promote the general welfare of the city. 
    Upon receipt of an appeal, the city council shall confer with the planning commission. The planning commission shall report thereon to the city council, detailing the relevant facts and considerations of the application. The city council may then affirm, reverse, or modify in whole or in part, any determination of the planning commission or may approve or disapprove any application upon which the planning commission has taken action. A majority vote of the whole city council shall be sufficient to affirm, reverse, or modify any determination of the planning commission.

(4)  Future development. Since the A-R district is designed to provide a smooth transition between areas which are low density or rural in nature and newly urbanizing areas, it is expected that in the future, tracts of land designated A-R will be developed into more urban uses. At the time the property owner of A-R designated land initiates redevelopment of the land into parcels smaller than required in the A-R district, the property must be rezoned to a classification that will support the proposed uses. Uses permitted or designated as uses permitted on review under A-R zoning that are not permitted or are not UPOR's in the proposed zone will be considered as nonconforming uses.

Sec. 29-184. - Location and application. 
    A telecommunications tower may be located in all zoning districts within the City of Pine Bluff and may be processed and approved, with necessary information and agreements, through administrative review of the zoning department when in conformance with this chapter. 
(a)  Minor wireless telecommunication facilities. The following minor telecommunications facilities may be permitted upon the completion, submittal, and approval of a minor TUP application accompanied by a scale site plan and a letter stating the proposed scope of work. 
(1)  Installation of an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, electric transmission tower and similarly sealed public utilities/facilities, water tower, or other free-standing non-residential structure) may be approved by the zoning administrator provided that the addition of the antenna does not add more than twenty (20) feet to the height of the existing structure. 
(2)  Installation of an antenna on an existing tower of any height and the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with such additional antenna may be permitted by the zoning administrator, so long as the proposed additions would not increase the height of the tower above the maximum height permitted in the zone in which it is located, dependent upon meeting other height criteria, and would cause no more than twenty-five (25) percent increase in the square footage occupied by the communication facility. The addition or modification of structures other than towers shall meet all setbacks of zoning district in which the tower or facilities are located. 
(b)  Major telecommunication facilities. Telecommunications facilities not meeting the criteria specified in (a) of this section are classified as major telecommunication facilities. TUP's for major telecommunication facilities may be approved when all development standards have been met and all required documentation has been submitted. 
(1)  In general. 
A.  Each applicant shall agree to cooperate with the city and other applicants hereafter by designing towers such that other users may co-locate upon that same tower. In general, any tower constructed to a height of one hundred twenty (120) feet shall be designed to accommodate two (2) users, and towers constructed to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet and above shall be designed to accommodate three (3) or more users. Permitted heights specified are dependent upon the zoning district in which the tower is to be located. Applicants must offer to lease space in good faith and at a fair market rate. Any tower owner operating under an approved TUP who does not offer to lease out extra space at a fair market rate may be subject to revocation of its TUP. Each applicant shall notify the zoning department in writing of the name and address of any and all co-users of a tower or antenna. 
B.  All TUP applications for new tower construction will be considered only after the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the planning director that: 
1.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area that would meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
2.  Existing towers or suitable structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
3.  Existing towers or suitable structures do not have sufficient structure strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
4.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
5.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure, or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing, are unreasonable. Any such costs that exceed the cost of new tower development, including but not limited to site locating, site purchase price or property lease, tower materials and construction, and any governmental development or review fees, are presumed to be unreasonable. 
6.  Applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
Supporting documentation claiming any of the above factors must be presented at the time of TUP submittal. 
C.  All towers must meet or exceed the then current federal standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal or state government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas and the construction and specifications thereof. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the tower and antenna owners governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal or state agency. Failure to timely bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antennas at the owner's expense and/or grounds to terminate or not renew owner's approved TUP. 
D.  To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall construct and maintain the tower in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable then current standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. To this end, prior to the initial issuance or the renewal of any permit, the tower shall be certified by a professional engineer licensed and/or registered by the State of Arkansas and knowledgeable in the design and/or analysis of towers as being safe and meeting all applicable codes and standards. If upon inspection, the building inspector concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon written notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within thirty (30) days, the governing authority may terminate that owner's approved TUP, cause that owner's TUP not to be renewed, and/or cause the removal of such tower (at the owner's expense). 
E.  Every tower shall be inspected a minimum of every twenty-four (24) months at the owner's expense, by a structural engineer registered and/or licensed in and by the State of Arkansas who is regularly involved in the maintenance, inspection, and/or erection of communication towers. At a minimum, this inspection shall be conducted in accordance with the tower inspection checklist provided in the Electronics Industrials Association Standard 222, "Structure Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Support Structure", as such standards may from time to time be amended. A copy of such inspection record shall be provided to the zoning department. 
(2)  TUP submittal. The applicant requesting approval of a TUP shall at the time of submittal of the application provide the following information in addition to any documentation required above. All submitted supporting documentation must be signed and sealed by the appropriate licensed professionals. 
A.  A scale site plan containing information showing the property boundaries, existing land uses, surrounding land uses and zoning, access road(s) location and surface material, existing and proposed structures, and topography. The site plan/attachments must contain information regarding any tower guy wire anchors and other apparatus needed for support and must indicate proposed landscaping, fencing, parking areas, location of any signage, and specifications on proposed lighting of the facility. 
B.  A written report is to be submitted including information describing the tower height and design, a cross section of the structure, engineering specifications detailing construction of the tower, base, and guy wire anchorage. Information must also be included describing the proposed painting and lighting schemes and the tower's capacity, including the number and type of antennas that it can accommodate. 
C.  A statement, in writing, stating the availability, or unavailability of space on other facilities within the City of Pine Bluff, to include reasons why co-location is not obtainable as set forth in section 4(b)(1)b. 
(3)  Development standards. 
a.  Height and supporting structures. 
1.  An attached antenna or an attached WCF shall not add more than twenty (20) feet in height to the existing building or structure to which it is attached. 
2.  Towers shall have the following maximum height when other development standards can be met and when designed to accommodate the required number of users (section 4,(b)(1)a.):

An attached antenna array may extend up to thirty (30) inches horizontally beyond the edge of the attached structure so long as the antenna array does not encroach upon an adjoining parcel. 
2.  General siting criteria: Regardless of the zoning district in which the tower is to be located, all antenna array supporting structures shall not be located nearer to any existing single-family dwelling or any lot zoned for single-family dwelling development than a distance equal to the height of the supporting structure, even when the property on which the tower is to be located does not abut said residential use property or when the existing single-family residence(s) are not located in a residential zone. Existing residential dwellings or residential development lots within this distance that are owned either by the owner of the property being leased for tower purposes or by the owner of the proposed tower shall be considered to have met this requirement. 
3.  Setbacks. 
(A)  In addition to other siting requirements, when located in or abutting a residential zone, towers or antenna array supporting structures must be setback from the property line a distance equal to the overall height of the tower constructed, or minimum setback for the zoning classification, whichever is greater. 
(B)  In addition to other siting requirements, when located in or abutting zoning districts other than residential, towers or antenna array supporting structures shall meet the setback requirements for principal structures of the underlying zone in which they are located. Guy wires and support devices other than the supporting structure shall maintain a minimum setback of twenty (20) feet from any property line, or the minimum setback for the zoning classification, whichever is greater. 
(C)  Accessory facilities and structures other than towers and supporting devices must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
c.  Landscaping and aesthetics. 
1.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landform on the site shall be preserved to the extent feasible; provided, however, that vegetation that causes interference with the antenna or inhibits access to the equipment storage may be trimmed. Any trees in excess of six (6) inches in diameter which are to be cut must be indicated on the site plan. 
2.  Towers shall be designed so as to be compatible with the existing structures and surroundings to the extent feasible. Such requirements shall not interfere with normal functioning of the tower or antenna array and may include the use of compatible or neutral colors, or stealth technology. 
3.  If the base of a tower is visible from neighboring residences, the base of the tower shall be screened by privacy fencing or landscaping appropriate to the context of the site and in harmony with the character of the surrounding environment. 
4.  Off-street parking shall be established as set forth in article V, division 2 of this chapter, and access roads or driveways installed to access the tower site and base shall be improved to the standards set forth in article V, division 2, section 29-159(a) of this chapter. 
d.  Lighting. 
1.  Towers shall not be artificially illuminated, directly or indirectly, except as may be required by state or federal law or other applicable authority. It shall be the owner's responsibility to meet FAA lighting requirements, if necessary. If artificial lighting is required, the lighting design and intensity chosen should be that which complies with the applicable guidelines, yet causes the least disturbance to the surrounding and nearby properties. 
2.  Security lighting or motion-activated lighting may be used around the base of a tower and within the telecommunication facility, provided that the lighting is shielded in such a way that no light is directed towards adjacent properties or rights-of-way. 
3.  The tower shall not display any signage or message of a commercial nature except for an inconspicuous message containing provider identification and emergency telephone numbers. 
e.  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by a security fence not less than six (6) feet. Fencing must be constructed in accordance with the zoning ordinance.

    Agreements accompanying a request for new supporting structures or attached antenna arrays shall include the following to be executed with the City of Pine Bluff: 
(a)  Any tower whose use is discontinued shall be removed by the owner, and shall be reported to the City of Pine Bluff immediately. All discontinued facilities shall be removed within six (6) months and the site restored to its original condition, al at the owner's expense. 
(b)  Any discontinued tower not removed within six (6) months may be removed by the city at the owner's expense. 
(Ord. No. 5880, § 1, 5-1-00) 
Sec. 29-186. - Environmental impact. 
    Assessments of environmental impact are required by federal law to be prepared by personal wireless service carriers when facilities are located in officially designated wilderness or wildlife areas, threaten endangered species or critical habitats, affect historic sites or structures, located in floodplains, or significantly change a surface area involving wetlands, deforestation, or water diversions. Since these assessments are already required by federal law, these provisions are incorporated into this ordinance and certification of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (43 U.S.C. Section 4321) must be provided before any permits will be issued. 
(Ord. No. 5880, § 1, 5-1-00)

ARTICLE VII. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 5923, §§ I-XXII, adopted Dec. 20, 2000, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, its inclusion as §§ 29-201-29-226 was at the discretion of the editor to read as herein set out. See the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 29-201. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States-Six hundred (600) in 1982; two thousand two hundred (2,200) in 1983; four thousand six hundred (4,600) in 1984; eight thousand five hundred fifty-five (8,555) in 1985; two hundred fifty-three thousand four hundred forty-eight (253,448) in 1992; and five hundred seventy-three thousand eight hundred (573,800) through June 1996. 
(8)  As of June, 2000, there have been two thousand eight hundred sixty-five (2,865) reported cases of AIDS in the State of Arkansas. 
(9)  Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in Arkansas, four thousand seven hundred fifty-six (4,756). 
(10)  The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with thirty-three thousand six hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982 and forty-five thousand two hundred (45,200) through November of 1990. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million (500,000) cases being reported in 1990. 
(12)  The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(16)  The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (15) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(17)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
(24)  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(25)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.
