PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Clearwater, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through September 20, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of Part II, Subpart A, of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, but the chapters of Part II, Subparts B and C, are not in alphabetical order. The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the decimal point refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the decimal point refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1.02, and the first section of chapter 8 is 8.01. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3.01 and 3.02 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3.015. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained, where appropriate, when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Linda Davis, Senior Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to M. A. Galbraith, Jr., City Attorney; Cynthia E. Goudeau, City Clerk; and Mary K. Diana, Assistant City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Tallahassee, Florida  
ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
ORDINANCE NO. 5334-93 
An Ordinance of the City of Clearwater, Florida, Relating to the City Code of Ordinances; Adopting and Enacting a New Code of Ordinances; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; Providing for Severability; and Providing An Effective Date. 
Be It Ordained by the City Commission of the City of Clearwater, Florida: 
    Section 1. The Code of Ordinances, consisting of Chapters 1 through 55, inclusive, together with the Appendix thereto, entitled "Code of Ordinances, City of Clearwater, Florida," published by Municipal Code Corporation of Tallahassee, Florida, and dated 1992, a copy of which accompanies this ordinance, is hereby adopted and enacted as the Code of Ordinances of the City of Clearwater, Florida. The Code of Ordinances may be referred to as the "Code of Ordinances," the "City Code," the "Clearwater Code," the "Code of 1992," or by any other informal name, provided that the context establishes that the reference is to the Code of Ordinances adopted by this ordinance or as the same may be amended from time to time. 
    Section 2. The Code of Ordinances shall be treated and considered as a new and original comprehensive ordinance which shall supersede all general and permanent ordinances of the City adopted on or before October 1, 1992, subject to the reservation of rights, obligations and liabilities as set forth in Section 5, below. All provisions of the Code of Ordinances shall be in full force and effect from and after February 4, 1993. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City of Clearwater, adopted on final passage on or before October 1, 1992, and not included in the Code of Ordinances or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are hereby repealed from and after February 4, 1993, except as provided in Section 1.10 of the Code of Ordinances and in Section 5 of this ordinance. Provided, however, that: 
(1)  The repeal provided for in this section shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this ordinance; and 
(2)  The repeal provided for in this section shall not be construed to repeal any ordinance which may be determined to be of a general and permanent nature and not protected by Section 1.10 of the Code of Ordinances, but which was not delivered to Municipal Code Corporation for codification in the Code of Ordinances or any earlier edition of the Code of Ordinances. 
    Section 3. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, a violation of any provision of the Code of Ordinances, or any provision of any rule or regulation adopted or issued pursuant thereto, shall be punished as provided in Sections 1.12 and 1.13 of the Code of Ordinances. 
    Section 4. Any and all additions and amendments to the Code of Ordinances, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Commission to make the same as part of the Code of Ordinances, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code of Ordinances so that reference to the "Code of Ordinances, City of Clearwater" shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
    Section 5. Neither the adoption of the Code of Ordinances nor the repeal of any ordinance as provided by Section 2 shall affect any right, obligation or liability accrued before the effective date of this ordinance, or any right, obligation or liability to be determined and established where a lawsuit, administrative proceeding, or claim is pending, including but not necessarily limited to any indebtedness, resolution, administrative rule or regulation, right of franchise, special assessment, land use or zoning regulation, or violation of the former Code of Ordinances or any part thereof, which rights, obligations and liabilities are preserved. In any action, administrative hearing, contract, ordinance, resolution, citation or notice to appear, correspondence, or other matter in which a reference has been made to the former Code of Ordinances or to any part thereof by chapter, article, or section number, such reference shall be deemed amended by inference to the corresponding chapter, article, or section number in this Code of Ordinances. 
    Section 6. A copy of the Code of Ordinances shall be kept on file with the other public records maintained by the City Clerk, in looseleaf form or in such other form as the City Clerk may consider most expedient. It shall be the duty of the City Clerk, or someone authorized by the City Clerk, to insert in their designated places all amendments or ordinances which indicate the intention of the City Commission to make the same a part of the Code of Ordinances, when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from the Code of Ordinances all provisions which may from time to time be repealed by the City Commission. This copy of the Code of Ordinances shall be available for inspection by all persons desiring to examine the same, during the normal business hours of the City. 
    Section 7. It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend, by additions, deletions, or otherwise, any provision of the Code of Ordinances or any portion thereof, or otherwise to alter or tamper with the Code of Ordinances in any manner which will cause the law of the City of Clearwater to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall upon conviction be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00 plus court costs. 
    Section 8. Should any part of this ordinance be declared invalid by any court, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part declared invalid, and for that reason this ordinance is declared severable. 
    Section 9. This ordinance shall become effective on February 4, 1993.

(4)  With the exception of maintenance or emergency dredging, or dredging relating to those portions of Dunedin Pass and Stevenson's Creek located within the boundaries of the city, permits for dredging or filling in excess of 10,000 cubic yards below the mean high water line may be authorized only after a properly advertised public hearing before the council and approval at referendum. 
(5)  Real property. 
(i)  Prior to the sale, donation, lease for a term longer than five years, or other transfer of any municipal real property, the real property must be declared surplus and no longer needed for municipal public use by the council at an advertised public hearing. Except in the case of right-of-way dedications, the granting of easements, transactions with governmental entities as described herein, or conveyance for Workforce or Affordable Housing no real property may be given away or donated without prior approval at referendum. Following a public hearing, the City Council may approve the donation or sale for less than fair market value of city-owned property of not more than one-half acre in size for workforce or affordable housing. Workforce or Affordable Housing means housing affordable to persons or families whose total annual income does not exceed 120 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), adjusted for household size, as published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for Pinellas County or metropolitan area. 
(ii)  Except as otherwise provided herein, real property declared surplus shall be sold to the party submitting the highest competitive bid above the appraised value whose bid meets the terms set by the council and whose proposed use of the property is in accordance with the council's stated purpose for declaring the property surplus, if any. However, when the property declared surplus is vacated right-of-way in which the city owns the fee interest and the vacated right-of-way is abutted by a single property owner, no competitive bid shall be required; and the city may sell the property to the abutting property owner for not less than fair market value. 
(iii)  Surplus real property may be transferred to another governmental entity for less than the appraised value after an advertised public hearing has been held and a finding by the council of a valid public purpose for the transfer. 
(iv)  Surplus real property may be exchanged for other real property having a comparable appraised value. 
(v)  No municipally owned real property which was identified as recreation/open space on the city's comprehensive land use plan map on November 16, 1989, or at any time thereafter, may be sold, donated, leased for a new use, or otherwise transferred without prior approval at referendum, except when the council determines it appropriate to dedicate right-of-way from, or easement over, such property. Such recreation/open space property may be leased for an existing use, without referendum, unless such lease is otherwise prohibited by charter or ordinance. 
(vi)  No right-of-way or easement which terminates at, or provides access to, the water's edge of a body of fresh or salt water may be vacated for private benefit. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent an easement solely for utility purposes from being vacated, exchanged for a new easement for similar purposes or from converting a fee interest for utility purposes into an easement for such purposes. 
(vii)  The council may lease municipal real property for five years or less without declaring it surplus. Municipal real property declared surplus may be leased for a term up to 65 years, provided, however, nothing herein shall preclude renewal of any lease for a maximum of 30 years. Municipal property declared surplus may be leased for an initial period of more than 65 years or a renewal period exceeding 30 years, if approved at referendum, but not to exceed 95 years total.

If the purchase price of such property equals or exceeds $1,000,000.00, the council shall obtain at least two appraisals by independent certified appraisers.

That portion of Memorial Causeway (S.R. 60) a 1,200-foot-wide right-of-way, lying between the east abutment of the west bridge and the east line of Clearwater Harbor, and the submerged portions of Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund Deed Numbers 17,500 and 17,502, shall be developed or maintained other than as open space and public utilities together with associated appurtenances, except upon a finding by the council at a duly advertised public hearing that such development is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and approval of such finding at referendum, conducted subsequent to the public hearing. 
For the purpose of this section "open space" shall include plazas, sidewalks, boardwalks, elevated walkways, paths, trails, roadways, stairs, benches, tables, water fountains, litter receptacles, lighting, wayfinding and similar amenities and surface parking. As an exception to the open space limitation contained herein, the following uses and facilities are allowed to be constructed and maintained on that portion of the city-owned property lying west of Osceola Avenue, east of Clearwater Harbor between Drew and Pierce Streets: a city-owned bandshell and associated facilities including removable seating; city-owned tennis courts and associated appurtenances, playground, splash pad, water features, artwork and similar amenities; public restrooms and park storage.

Potable water, shore power, sewage pump out and restroom facilities may be provided to and located on the slips, docks and moorings. The dockmaster's office may include coin-operated washers and dryers and sale of ice. The parking for the facility, which may be designated for use by slip tenants, shall be existing surface parking which shall be brought up to code and shall not result in any net loss of green space. City may permit ferries, water taxis, excursion boats and similar uses to access the docks for drop off and pick up of passengers, booths for ticket sales, and directional signage. The promenade shall be constructed on a portion of the footprint of the prior bridge. City council shall adopt by resolution regulations that provide city residents first priority for the dedicated boat slips and which ensure public access to the docks, boardwalks and promenade, however nothing herein shall prohibit fencing and gates for security. Concessions for rental of non-motorized recreational equipment, including but not limited to canoes, kayaks, paddleboards, and paddleboats may be permitted and a restroom and boathouse structure not to exceed 2,000 square feet for storage of said equipment may be permitted. Except for a ramp for launching of non-motorized recreational equipment, including but not limited to canoes, kayaks, paddleboards, and paddleboats, no boat launching ramps, fueling facilities or parking garage shall be permitted. 
(7)  No city owned real property in the area bounded on the north by Drew Street, on the east by Osceola Avenue, on the south by Pierce Street, and on the west by the waters of Clearwater Harbor, shall be sold, donated, leased, or otherwise transferred or used for other than city facilities except upon a finding by the council at a duly advertised public hearing that such transfer or use is necessary and in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and the approval of such finding at referendum. Except that the structure known as Harborview Center, as described in Appendix B may be leased for and used in furtherance of any municipal purpose consistent with the charter and ordinances of the city; and, portions of the Downtown Main Library may be leased and used for a café or restaurant, special events, art galleries, maker space, and other compatible public and commercial uses. Additionally, the council at a duly advertised public hearing, may grant easements for underground utilities.

Code reference- Firemen's relief and pension fund, § 2.431 et seq. 
State Law reference- Municipal firemen's pension trust fund, F.S. ch. 175. 

Section 1. - Creation of fund; contributions; transfer of property to trustees; tax authorized.- 
(1)  There is hereby created a fund to be known as the pension fund of the Fire Department of the City of Clearwater. Each member of the fire department, as defined by section 2 shall pay into said fund 6 percent of his or her salary each month, the same to be deducted by the director of finance and deposited with said fund for the purpose of assisting in the payment of benefits to be paid by this act; provided that no firefighter shall be required to contribute more than 6 percent of a salary equivalent to that received by a firefighter holding the rank of captain. 
(2)  All right, title, and interest in and to said fund, assets, and securities of the fire pension fund collected under the provisions of chapter 175, Florida Statutes, shall be divided on a pro rata basis between the firefighters of the City of Clearwater participating under this act and fund and all other firefighters employed by the City of Clearwater, and said pro rata portion of said moneys shall be deposited into this fund. 
(3)  The City of Clearwater shall levy, assess, and collect a tax upon all property in the City of Clearwater in the same manner as other taxes are levied, assessed, and collected not to exceed six-tenths of one mill, the same to be used with the members' annual contributions heretofore provided for, and such other contributions as the fund may receive from any source including earnings on the assets held by the pension fund. Such assessment and tax shall commence as of the first taxable year after the effective date of this act and shall continue for a period of 35 years thereafter, except as herein otherwise provided; however, the rate of assessment and tax for the first 10 years from the effective date of this act shall be six-tenths of one mill, except as herein otherwise provided. 
(4)  If at any time subsequent to the effective date of this act there shall be a total reassessment of all taxable real property and improvements thereon within the corporate limits of the City of Clearwater, then effective commencing with the first taxable year thereafter the millage rate of the tax that the city shall levy, assess, collect, and contribute to the fund shall be automatically reduced and shall remain at the same rate unless subsequently reduced by other reassessments or changed as herein otherwise provided. 
(5)  The formula for reducing the millage rate of the tax will be based on the assessed value of all taxable property in the City of Clearwater for the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the reassessment takes effect. The estimated value of new construction and annexed real property that was added to the tax assessment roll will be deducted from the reassessed taxable value and the difference between the remaining value and the taxable value of the preceding year shall be computed as a percentage of increased valuation that has been realized directly because of the reassessment, and that percentage shall be applied to reduce the six-tenths of one mill proportionately. In estimating the value of new construction and annexed property, historical trends, building permits, and actual annexation shall be used. 
(6)  If homestead exemption from ad valorem real property taxes is eliminated by competent authority, then the applicable millage rate of the tax to be levied by the city, or the equivalent thereof, shall be applied to the total assessment rolls of all taxable property within the city adjusted by deducting therefrom the increase in value on said rolls caused by the elimination of said homestead tax exemption. 
(7)  If any funds or assets remain in the pension fund after the satisfaction of all required pension payments and expenses, then such funds and assets shall be paid over and transferred to and become a part of the pension fund for the general employees of the City of Clearwater. 
(8)  Actuarial valuations of the fund shall be made at intervals of not more than 2 years during the first 10 years commencing with the effective date of this act; thereafter, actuarial valuations shall be made at intervals of not more than 3 years. Such actuarial valuations shall be made by a professional actuarial firm mutually agreed upon between the city and the trustees of said fund. If the city and the trustees cannot agree upon the actuarial firm to be hired within 90 days after interviewing prospective actuarial firms, a firm shall be selected by lot. If selection by lot is used, the city shall choose two firms and the trustees two firms. The firm then selected shall be that firm whose name is drawn from the names of the four firms previously selected. 
(9)  Beginning with the actuarial valuation made at the end of the 10th year after the effective date of this act and after each valuation made after that date, the trustees of said fund and the city shall review the valuations to determine if the original 35 years of contributions by the city will still be necessary. If the actuarial valuations indicate that a shorter time of funding is necessary to fund the amended benefits of the plan, the city will have the option to either reduce the millage or shorten the number of years that contributions will be made. Should the city elect to do either of the above, and at a later date, it is determined by one of the actuarial valuations that the amount being contributed by the city will not properly fund the benefits provided by the plan, the city shall increase its contributions to the maximum six-tenths of one mill, or the adjusted rate thereof pursuant to the procedure set forth in this section because of an overall tax reassessment of property, whichever is less, for whatever period the deficit continues to exist. If the actuarial valuation made after the first 10-year period or any subsequent valuation indicates that the equivalent of six-tenths of one mill or the adjusted rate thereof pursuant to the procedure set forth in this section because of an overall tax reassessment of property, whichever is less, contributed by the city for the period of 35 years will not properly fund the amended benefits provided by the plan, or if the funds on reserve at any time should become insufficient to pay the benefits provided by the plan, then the city shall provide funds from non-ad valorem revenues of the City of Clearwater to pay all such benefits for so long as any person is entitled to compensation under this act.

Employees who may be designated as code enforcement officers may include but are not limited to code inspectors, law enforcement officers, or fire safety inspectors. 
(b)  Prior to issuing a citation, the code enforcement officer shall provide notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of a city ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period, not to exceed 30 days and no fewer than five days, within which the person must correct the violation. If, upon personal investigation, the code enforcement officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the time period, the code enforcement officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation. The code enforcement officer does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation if a repeat violation is found or if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible, or if the violator is engaged in violations of an itinerant or transient nature.

10.  A conspicuous statement that if a person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(d)  A person who receives a citation from a code enforcement officer for the violation of a city ordinance and who elects not to contest the citation shall be subject to a civil penalty in accordance with the following schedule:

The schedule of fines and costs is included in this section to reflect the current uniform schedule of fines and costs imposed by the county court as of November 19, 1999. Any amendment to the uniform schedule of fines and costs by the county court shall take effect as ordered by the court, and shall be applicable to violations of city ordinances without the necessity to amend the schedule set forth in this section. 
(e)  A violation of any ordinance contained in this Code and enforced pursuant to subsection (3) of this section shall constitute a class V violation, except that a violation of the land development code shall constitute a class III violation, unless otherwise indicated; provided, however, that if the uniform schedule of fines and costs of the county court provides for a greater penalty, the greater penalty shall be imposed. 
(f)  A second or subsequent violation of the same ordinance by the same person shall result in the fine being doubled. 
(g)  Any person who fails to pay the appropriate civil penalty within the time allowed, or who fails to appear in county court to contest the citation, shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the citation, and judgment may be entered against the person for an amount not to exceed $500.00. 
(h)  The provisions of subsection (3) of this section shall not apply to enforcement pursuant to F.S. §§ 553.79 and 553.80 of building codes adopted pursuant to F.S. § 553.73 as they apply to construction, provided that a building permit is either not required or has been issued by the city. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "building codes" means only those codes adopted pursuant to F.S. § 553.73. 
(i)  The provisions of subsection (3) of this section are an additional and supplemental means of enforcing city codes and ordinances. Nothing contained in subsection (3) of this section shall prohibit the city from enforcing its codes or ordinances by any other means. 
(4)  In addition to the penalties provided for in this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city as provided by law, and each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.

    Board means the Clearwater Downtown Development Board created pursuant to this division and any successor to its functions, authority, rights and obligations.

    Freeholder means any individual, corporation, or other artificial legal entity, who is an owner of real property in the downtown area not wholly exempt from ad valorem taxation including those claiming homestead. 
    Including shall be construed as merely introducing illustrative examples and not as limiting in any way the generality of the inclusive term. 
    Majority with qualification means a majority of a quorum. 
(Code 1980, § 22.40; Ord. No. 5510-93, § 1, 12-16-93; Ord. No. 6394-99, § 1, 3-18-99) 
Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1.02. 
Sec. 2.142. - Liberal construction of division. 
    The provisions of this division, being desirable for the welfare of the city and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes set forth in this division. 
(Code 1980, § 22.54) 
Sec. 2.143. - Statement of policy and findings. 
(1)  It is the policy of the city to make it possible for the city to revitalize and preserve property values and prevent deterioration in the central business district by a system of self-help to correct the blight of such deterioration as has developed there. It is a purpose of this division to provide the means whereby property owners within the district and benefiting directly from the result of such a program will bear the substantial cost thereof and therefore local problems may be solved on a local level. 
(2)  The city commission hereby declares that among the many causes of commercial blight in the downtown area are the following: Automobile traffic flow is impeded by outmoded street patterns, a proliferation of uncoordinated uses and parking areas, unsuitable topography, faulty lot layouts, fragmentation of land uses and parking areas necessitating frequent automobile movement, lack of separation of vehicle traffic lanes, railroad traffic and air pollution. Voluntary cooperation for coordinated development has limitations because of fragmentary ownership, distant absentee ownership and unusual conditions of title and other conditions. 
(3)  The downtown area is plagued with vacant and deteriorating buildings which are neglected and produce a depressing atmosphere. Similarly there is much vacant land area in the downtown area and these factors tend to combine to put the downtown area at a competitive disadvantage to modern offices and shopping centers developing in the area. These factors tend to develop an image of the downtown area which is unrepresentative of its economic vitality and out-of-place with the growth of the city, thus producing a tarnishing effect on the overall image of the city. 
(4)  The area now has few residences and many of the residences which do exist are of inferior construction which would not be permitted for new construction under the city's building code. It is in some instances a proper function of government to remove blight and blighting influences from commercial areas. The police power may be inadequate to accomplish this purpose. One effective device for removal of the blight of the downtown area is the planning and implementation of planning for appropriate land use and beautification, the continuity of planning and aesthetic and technical design concepts, and the removal of deteriorated and obsolescent structures. 
(5)  Responsibility for the planning and implementation in the downtown area as described in the preceding subsection (4) rests primarily with the CRA. The city commission declares that the powers of the board created by this division are desired as an aid to the CRA to: 
(a)  Guide and accomplish the coordinated, balanced and harmonious development of the downtown area in accordance with existing and future needs; 
(b)  Promote the health, safety and general welfare of the area, and its inhabitants, visitors, property owners and workers; 
(c)  Establish, maintain, and preserve aesthetic values and preserve and foster the development and display of attractiveness; 
(d)  Prevent overcrowding and congestion; 
(e)  Improve auto traffic and provide pedestrian safety; and 
(f)  Provide a way of life which combines the conveniences and amenities of modern living with the traditions and pleasures of the past.

Sec. 2.144. - Boundaries of downtown area.

(2)  Amendment. The board created in section 2.147 shall have the power from time to time by the following procedure to alter or amend the boundaries of the downtown area: 
(a)  The board shall first set a date for public hearing on the adoption of a resolution amending the description of the downtown area and shall cause a notice of the public hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation published in the city, which notice shall be published four times, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days from the date of the hearing. The notice shall set forth the date, time and place of the hearing and shall describe the boundaries of the existing downtown area as defined in this section and shall describe the changes to be made thereto. Additionally, the board shall cause to be mailed to each owner of the property, according to the tax collector's records existing in the county, a copy of the notice as published in the paper. 
(b)  After the public hearing, the board shall adopt a resolution defining the changes in the downtown area. The board shall not incorporate land into the district not included in the description contained in the notice of public hearing, but it may eliminate any lands from the area.

However, if any deletion shall be made in the area defined in this section, then all the freeholders within the area defined in this section shall be entitled to vote in the freeholders' referendum. 
(Code 1980, § 22.42) 
Sec. 2.145. - Freeholders' referenda and elections. 
    Whenever a freeholders' referendum is required or an election of board members is necessary, such referendum or election shall be conducted as follows: 
(1)  Election supervisor. For the purposes of conducting freeholders' referenda and elections, the board shall use an independent entity to act as election supervisor and do all things necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, except for those functions specified in this section to be performed by the board. 
(2)  Registration from tax assessment rolls. The board shall obtain a list of the names and the last known addresses of the freeholders in the downtown area from the tax assessment rolls of the county and such list shall constitute the registration list for the purposes of any freeholders referendum, except as provided in this section. 
(3)  Notification. Notification of freeholders' referenda and elections shall be by United States mail and in addition thereby by publication one time in a newspaper of general circulation. 
(4)  Voting. Voting shall be as provided in the by-laws of the downtown development board, which by-laws shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this section. Within 30 days after the closing of the registration list, the election supervisor shall have a secret and direct ballot of the freeholders. 
(5)  Certification of election. Within 48 hours after holding the election, the election supervisor shall certify the results thereof to the downtown development board. Any person voting who has knowledge that he or she is not a freeholder shall be guilty of perjury and shall be prosecuted and upon conviction punished in accordance with the provisions of the laws of this state. 
(6)  Passage of division. The freeholders shall be deemed to have approved the passage of the measure submitted to the electorate at such time as the election supervisor certifies to the downtown development board that in excess of 50 percent of those voting were in favor of the measure. For the purposes of this division, one vote shall be allowed for each parcel of property. Where a parcel of property is owned by more than one person, the Joint and several owners of the parcel shall designate a voting representative who shall cast one ballot for the parcel. If a parcel of property is owned by a corporation or other artificial legal entity, the entity shall designate a voting representative who shall case one ballot for the parcel. The voting representative shall be designated as provided in the by-laws of the board. 
(7)  Elections after changing of boundaries. Additional freeholders' elections called after increasing or decreasing the boundaries of the downtown area in accordance with section 2.144 shall be held in accordance with the referendum provisions for initial approval of this division; provided, however, that no provision of this division shall require the approval of freeholders in an area which has previously approved of the provisions of this division by any referendum held pursuant to this section, unless there is involved a decrease in the boundaries of the downtown area. 
(8)  Dissolution. The dissolution of the district, the abolition of the board, and the repeal of this division may be requested by a petition of the freeholders representing at least 30 percent of the freeholders in the downtown area. Upon the receipt of such a petition by the city clerk, the board shall consider and decide whether to take such action by resolution upon compliance with the requirements of section 189.4043, Florida Statutes. 
(9)  Cost of elections. The cost of elections to be held under this division shall be borne by the board.

The nominee receiving the greatest number of votes after those elected for three-year terms shall be elected and shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the majority of the board is unable to appoint someone to fill the vacancy within 60 days, the City Commission shall have the power to make such appointment.

b.  In conjunction with the employer and medical consultants, establish the scope of the medical examinations to be used for benefit eligibility and medical standards to be used for benefit eligibility and to guide the examining physicians in reaching their conclusions and recommendations.

(3)  No benefits or relief shall be provided to any participant under the plan unless the same has been reviewed by the committee and a recommendation provided to the trustees. 
(f)  Conflict in terms. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this plan and any explanatory booklet, this plan shall control.

The trustees may appoint such actuaries, accountants, professional investment counsel, legal counsel, specialists, third party pension administrators, and other persons that they deem necessary and desirable in connection with the administration of this plan or to assist them in the performance of their duties as trustees.

a.  Again satisfies the definition of "employee" set forth in section 2.393 (including passing the comprehensive physical examination), and 
b.  Repays the amount of any employee contributions he received in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of section 2.397. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee who is reemployed after his benefits have commenced under the plan (other than disability benefits pursuant to paragraph (c) of section 2.397) shall not be eligible to participate in the plan upon his subsequent reemployment. 
(c)  Separation from employment for military service.

a.  The participant must return to his employment as an employee within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from service. 
b.  The participant deposits into the plan the same sum that the participant would have contributed if he had remained an employee during his absence. The participant must deposit all missed contributions within a period equal to three times the period of military service, but not more than five years from the date of reemployment or he will forfeit the right to receive credited service for his military service pursuant to this section, except that a police officer or firefighter participant shall not be required to deposit contributions to receive credited service.

(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.396. - Contributions to the plan. 
(a)  Employee contributions. 
(1)  For each plan year, an employee required to participate in the plan shall make regular contributions to the plan in the amount of eight percent of his compensation. Employee contributions withheld by the employer on behalf of the employee shall be deposited with the trustees at least monthly, except that such contributions shall be deposited immediately after each pay period for police officer and firefighter participants. 
(2)  The contributions made by each employee under the plan shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the employees' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the plan, such contributions shall be considered employee contributions.

a.  Seven percent of the compensation of all employees participating in the plan; provided, however, that for the plan year beginning January 1, 1996, the employer contribution to the plan may be less than seven percent (but in no event less than six percent) of the compensation of all employees participating in the plan; plus 
b.  Such additional amounts as may be required to satisfy the plan's funding requirements for the plan year and the cost of administering the plan, as determined by the actuary employed by the trustees.

(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.397. - Benefits under the plan. 
(a)  Normal retirement benefit. 
(1)  A participant shall be entitled to retire from the employ of his employer upon such participant's normal retirement date. 
(2)  Upon reaching his normal retirement date, a participant shall be fully vested in his accrued benefit and shall be entitled to receive, at the time and in the manner described in section 2.398, his normal retirement benefit. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section 2.397. 
a.  The normal retirement benefit shall be a monthly income, paid in accordance with the normal form of benefit described below, that is equal to the product of: 
1.  Two and one-half percent of the participant's average monthly compensation, multiplied by 
2.  The participant's years of credited service. 
b.  Effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, in the case of employees who are performing active service on behalf of the employer on January 1, 1996, "two and three-quarters percent" shall be substituted for "two and one-half percent" in subparagraph a. above. An employee will be deemed to be performing active service if he is actively employed by the employer (working on a continuous basis), inclusive of light duty assignments made by the employer and the use of sick leave, vacation leave, military leave, family medical leave, or other approved leaves of absence from which the employee is anticipated to return to regular duty. This subparagraph b. shall not apply to employees who, as of January 1, 1996, no longer perform active service for the employer but who remain on the employer's payroll and are compensated for a given period on the basis of vacation time, sick leave, severance benefits or any other type of leave of absence and whose employment with the employer is expected to terminate following such compensated period. 
(3)  a.  The normal form of benefit shall be an annuity paid monthly for the life of the participant, with a 100 percent survivor annuity paid monthly for a period of five years following the death of the participant to the beneficiary or beneficiaries described in paragraph (e) of this section 2.397; provided, further, that following such five year period the survivor annuity shall be reduced to 50 percent of the original survivor annuity amount, except that, if greater for police officers and firefighters, the normal form of benefit shall be an annuity paid monthly for the life of the participant with 120 payments guaranteed. 
b.  The survivor annuity paid to the participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with subparagraph (3)a. above shall cease following: 
1.  The last day of the month in which occurs the designated beneficiary's death or remarriage, if such designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, or 
2.  The last day of the month in which occurs the designated beneficiary's death or attainment of age 18, if the designated beneficiary is the participant's child or children. 
(4)  In the event that a participant does not begin to receive his normal retirement benefit at his normal retirement date, such participant shall be entitled to the benefit he was entitled to receive at his normal retirement date, adjusted to take into account his average monthly compensation and years of credited service as of his actual retirement date. 
(b)  Early retirement benefit. 
(1)  A participant shall be entitled to retire from the employ of his employer upon such participant's early retirement date. 
(2)  Upon reaching his early retirement date, the participant shall be fully vested in his accrued benefit and shall be entitled to receive, at the time and in the manner described in section 2.398, his early retirement benefit. 
(3)  A participant's early retirement benefit for police officer and firefighter participants shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above, and the amount of such benefit otherwise payable under paragraph (a) shall be reduced by three percent per year. 
(4)  If a participant separates from service before satisfying the age requirement for early retirement, but has satisfied the service requirement, the participant will be entitled to an early retirement benefit upon satisfaction of such age requirement. 
(c)  Disability benefit. 
(1)  a.  A participant who is vested in his accrued benefit and who terminates employment by reason of his disability shall be entitled to receive, at the time and in the manner described in section 2.398, a disability benefit equal to his accrued benefit as of the date of termination of his employment. 
b.  A participant who is deemed by the committee to be disabled by reason of an injury suffered or an illness contracted in the line of duty need not satisfy the vesting requirement set forth in subparagraph (1)a. above; provided, further, that the monthly amount of the disability benefit payable to a participant described in this subparagraph (1)b. shall not be less than 662/3 percent of such participant's average monthly compensation. 
c.  The provisions of this paragraph c. shall apply to participants who are determined by the committee to be disabled on or after January 1, 1996. 
(2)  A participant shall be considered disabled for purposes of the plan if, in the opinion of the committee, the participant is disabled due to sickness or injury, such disability is likely to be continuous and permanent from a cause other than specified in subparagraph (3) below, and such disability renders the participant unable to perform any useful, meaningful and necessary work for the employer in an available position for which the participant is reasonably qualified or for which the participant may be reasonably trained to perform, subject to the limitations below. 
a.  Any police officer or firefighter participant who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer or firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension provided for in subparagraph (c)(1). Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
b.  If a participant employed in a position other than as a sworn and state certified police officer or a state certified firefighter is disabled to the extent that he can not reasonably continue to perform the functions of his specific position, but remains capable of performing useful, meaningful and necessary work, he may be assigned to an alternate position with the employer in lieu of receiving disability benefits under the plan. For this purpose, the participant may be assigned to any other position with the employer that is available for which the participant has the skill and knowledge to perform or for which the participant can reasonably be trained to perform, such assignment to be with no loss of base pay regardless of whether the assignment to such position is at an equal or lower level. 
c.  For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the term "base pay" shall be defined as compensation at the rate prescribed for the particular job class in the employer's pay schedule. 
d.  The trustees of the plan shall make the determination in each instance if a participant who has been found disabled pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) above may be assigned to an alternate position with the employer as provided in (c)(2)a. and b. hereof. 
(3)  a.  Each participant who is not a police officer or firefighter who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the committee, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
1.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs intoxicants, or alcohol; 
2.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections; 
3.  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime; 
4.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces; 
5.  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as an employee with the employer shall have terminated; 
6.  Willful, wanton or gross negligence of the participant; or 
7.  Injury or disease sustained by the participant while working for anyone other than the employer and arising out of such employment. 
8.  A condition pre-existing the participant's participation in the plan. No participant shall be entitled to a disability pension, whether in line of duty or not in line of duty, because of or due to the aggravation of a specific injury, impairment or other medical condition pre-existing at the time of participation in the plan, provided that such pre-existing condition and its relationship to a later injury, impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a disability pension to a participant who, after membership in the plan, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition different from some other injury, impairment, or other medical condition existing at or prior to said participation. 
b.  Each police officer or firefighter participant, who is claiming disability benefits, shall establish to the satisfaction of the committee, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by, (except that paragraph 5. is only applicable to police officers): 
1.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
2.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
3.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
4.  Injury or disease sustained by the participant after his employment as a police officer or firefighter with the City of Clearwater shall have terminated. 
5.  For police officer participants, injury or disease sustained by the participant while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(4)  a.  A participant shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians, who shall be selected by the committee for that purpose. 
b.  1.  Any former participant receiving disability benefits under provisions of this plan may be periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians who shall be selected by the committee to determine if such disability has ceased to exist or if the former participant may be employed in an available position for which the participant is reasonably qualified in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (c)(2) above. If the committee finds that the former participant is no longer disabled or is capable of performing service for the employer in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (2) above, the committee may request the former participant to return to the employ of the employer. If the former participant returns to the performance of duty as an employee, he shall again be eligible to participate in the plan. In the event a former participant is no longer disabled or is deemed capable of returning to employment with the employer in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (2) above, and he does not return to employment with the employer pursuant to the committee's request, he shall forfeit the right to his disability benefit; provided further, that if an employee accepts employment with another employer in an occupation or line of work similar to the occupation or line of work that resulted in the employee being eligible for a disability benefit hereunder, he shall forfeit the right to his disability benefit. 
2.  A participant who returns to employment with the employer and recommences participation in the plan shall not receive credited service for the period during which he received disability benefits under the plan. 
c.  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the employee claiming and/or receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the plan. All other reasonable costs as determined by the committee incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation and meals, shall be borne by the plan. 
d.  The committee may establish such other rules and procedures as it deems necessary to implement the provisions of this paragraph c. 
(5)  A participant whose employment is terminated by reason of his death in the line of duty shall, for purposes of the plan, be deemed to have been disabled in the line of duty, and the participant's beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a disability benefit as described in paragraph (c)(1) above. 
(6)  If a participant receives a disability benefit under the plan and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. Ch. 440 for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the participant's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. Ch. 440, excluding overtime, the disability benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the participant does not exceed 100 percent of such wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit of a police officer or firefighter participant be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or two percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(7)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
a.  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a police officer or firefighter participant caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such participant shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram for police officer participants, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
b.  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this paragraph b. shall apply only to those conditions described in this paragraph b. that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this subsection 7.b., the following definitions apply: 
(i)  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
(ii)  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any participant employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. Ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
(iii)  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
(iv)  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
a)  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
b)  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
c)  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
d)  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
(v)  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety participant who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the participant must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
(i)  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
a)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
b)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
c)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
d)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
(ii)  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
(iii)  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the participant's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety participant may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the participant's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the participant's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety participant to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the participant from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety participant in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the participant of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety participant shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
(i)  An emergency rescue or public safety participant must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
(ii)  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety participant may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(d)  Termination of employment benefit. 
(1)  In the event a participant's employment with his employer is terminated for reasons other than retirement, disability or death, such participant shall be entitled to receive, at the time and in the manner described in section 2.398, a termination of employment benefit that is equal to the participant's vested interest in his accrued benefit as of the date of his termination of employment. 
(2)  a.  A participant's vested interest in his accrued benefit shall be the following percentage of his accrued benefit, based upon such participant's full years of credited service as of the date of his termination of employment: 
TOTAL NUMBER OF FULL YEARS 
OF CREDITED SERVICE VESTED 
INTEREST Less than 10 Years of Credited Service 0% 10 years or more 100%  
b.  Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, a participant shall be fully vested in his accrued benefit upon attaining his early retirement date or his normal retirement date. 
(3)  A participant who terminates employment with the employer prior to his early retirement date or his normal retirement date may elect to receive the total contributions he has made to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions. Upon making such election, the participant's interest in his accrued benefit shall be forfeited. 
(4)  If a participant terminates employment prior to his early retirement date or his normal retirement date and receives a distribution of his contributions (plus interest thereon) and is subsequently reemployed and again becomes a participant in this plan, his credited service for purposes of vesting and benefit accruals shall not include any periods of employment prior to his reemployment date unless he repays to the pension fund the greater of (i) the full amount previously distributed to him plus interest at the rate of five percent per annum from the date of distribution to the date of repayment or (ii) the actuarial present value of the accrued benefit previously forfeited. Such repayment must be made no later than the second anniversary of the participant's reemployment, except that if it is made by a police officer or firefighter participant no later than 90 days after reemployment, such repayment shall be the full amount previously distributed to him plus interest at a rate determined by the trustees. If a participant repays the foregoing amount to the pension fund within the prescribed time period, the interest of the participant in his accrued benefit previously forfeited under subparagraph (3) above shall be restored in full and the participant's credited service shall be based on all periods of employment. 
(e)  Death benefit. 
(1)  a.  1. In the event of the death of a participant who is vested in his accrued benefit prior to his termination of employment, his beneficiary (as described below) shall be entitled to receive a death benefit at the time and in the manner described in section 2.398. Said death benefit shall be in an amount equal to the accrued benefit of such participant as of the date of his death. 
2.  The participant's beneficiary may elect to receive, in lieu of the death benefit under the plan, the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions. Upon making such election, the participant's beneficiary shall forfeit any right to a death benefit under the plan. 
3.  If the participant does not have a beneficiary, the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions, shall be paid to the participant's estate. 
b.  In the event of the death of a participant who is not vested in his accrued benefit prior to his termination of employment, his beneficiary (or, if there is no beneficiary, his estate) shall be entitled to receive the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions. 
(2)  A participant whose employment is terminated by reason of his death in the line of duty shall be deemed, for purposes of the plan, to have been disabled in the line of duty and his benefit shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section 2.397. 
(3)  The participant's surviving spouse shall be deemed to be the beneficiary designated to receive the death benefit payable under the plan, and if none, his children under the age of 18 who are the participant's dependents (within the meaning of Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code) at the time of his death. 
(4)  If the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions, exceed the value of the death benefit paid under the plan, the amount by which such contributions (including interest thereon) exceed the value of the death benefit paid under the plan shall be paid to the participant's estate. 
(f)  Cost-of-living adjustment. Commencing on April 1, 2000, the monthly amount payable to all participants, beneficiaries and survivors who have received at least six monthly benefit payments as of each April 1, shall receive an annual cost-of-living adjustment on each April equal to one and one-half percent. 
(g)  Limitations on amount of benefits. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Subject to the adjustments hereinafter set forth, the maximum amount of annual retirement income payable with respect to a participant under this plan shall not exceed $160,000.00. 
For purposes of applying the above limitation, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits shall be adjusted, as provided by treasury regulations, so that such benefits are the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under § 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of § 415(b)(1) of the code. 
(2)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limitation of this section with respect to any participant who at any time has been a participant in any other defined benefit plan (as defined in § 414(j) of the Code) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all defined benefit plans in which the participant has been a participant were payable from one plan. 
(3)  Adjustments in limitations. 
a.  In the event the participant's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the $160,000.00 limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of § 415(b) of the Code, so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
b.  In the event a police officer or firefighter participant's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service, the adjustments provided for in a. above shall not apply. 
c.  The reductions provided for in a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to section 2.397(c), or pre- retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 2.397(e). 
d.  In the event the participant's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limitation set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(4)  Less than ten years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any participant who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the participant's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to section 2.397(c), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 2.397(e). 
(5)  Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a participant shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such participant under this plan and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the participant participated. 
(6)  [ Reserved. ] 
(7)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the participant's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which participant participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the participant participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such participant. 
(8)  Cost-of-living adjustments. The limitations as stated in subsections (1), (2),(3) and (6) herein shall be adjusted to the time payment of a benefit begins in accordance with any cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to § 415(d) of the code. 
(9)  This subparagraph (9) shall apply to the amount of benefit (as such term is described below) under this plan for any participant who is considered a restricted participant (as such term is described below). Such benefit shall be limited to an amount equal to the payments that would have been made on behalf of the restricted participant under a life annuity form of payment that is the actuarial equivalent of the restricted participant's accrued benefit under the plan. 
a.  For purposes of this subparagraph (9), the term "benefit" shall include retirement income provided by the plan, plus loans in excess of the amounts set forth in § 72(p)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, any periodic income, any withdrawal values payable to a living participant and any death benefits not provided for by insurance on the participant's life. 
b.  For purposes of this subparagraph (9), the term "restricted participant" shall mean all highly compensated employees. In any one plan year, the total number of participants whose benefits are subject to restriction under this subparagraph (9) shall be limited by the plan to a group of not less than 25 highly compensated employees with the greatest compensation. 
c.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this subparagraph (9) shall not restrict the current payment of the full amount of retirement income provided by the plan if: 
1.  After payment to a restricted participant of all of the benefit described above, the value of plan assets equals or exceeds 100 percent of the value of current liabilities, as defined in § 412(1)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, or 
2.  The value of the benefit described above for a restricted participant is less than one percent of the value of current liabilities, as defined in § 412(1)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code.

(1)  Any participant who is convicted of the following offenses committed prior to retirement, or whose employment is terminated by reason of his admitted commission, aid or abetment of the following specified offenses, shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this plan, except for the return of his accumulated contributions as of the date of termination.

(2)  Conviction shall be defined as an adjudication of guilt by a court of competent jurisdiction; a plea of guilty or a nolo contendere; a jury verdict of guilty when adjudication of guilt is withheld and the accused is placed on probation; or a conviction by the Senate of an impeachable offense. 
(3)  Court shall be defined as any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction which is exercising its jurisdiction to consider a proceeding involving the alleged commission of a specified offense. Prior to forfeiture, the board shall hold a hearing on which notice shall be given to the participant whose benefits are being considered for forfeiture. Said participant shall be afforded the right to have an attorney present. No formal rules of evidence shall apply, but the participant shall be afforded a full opportunity to present his case against forfeiture. 
(4)  Any participant who has received benefits from the plan in excess of his accumulated contributions after participant's rights were forfeited shall be required to pay back to the plan the amount of the benefits received in excess of his accumulated contributions. The board may implement all legal action necessary to recover such funds. 
(5)  Conviction and forfeiture; false, misleading or fraudulent statements for police officer and firefighter participants. 
a.

a.  To the designated beneficiary shall begin within one year following the participant's death (unless the designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, in which case such benefit shall begin no later than the date the participant would have reached 701/2) and shall not, in any event, extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the designated beneficiary; or

(d)  No payment unless sufficient funds. No benefits shall be paid under this plan unless at the time of such benefit payment the pension fund has sufficient assets to pay such benefits; provided, that in the event the assets in the pension fund are not sufficient to pay the benefit amounts due under the plan, the employer shall make additional contributions to the plan pursuant to paragraph (b) of section 2.396.

(2)  If this plan is terminated, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, the committee and the trustees shall continue to administer the plan in accordance with the provisions of the plan, for the sole benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries. In the event of termination, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, there shall be full vesting of benefits accrued to the date of termination and the assets of the plan shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
(3)  The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the plan as of the date of termination or the discontinuance of contributions, with the date of such discontinuance being determined by the trustees. 
a.  Apportionment shall first be made with respect to each employee receiving a benefit hereunder on such date, each person receiving a benefit on such date on account of a deceased employee, and each employee who has, by such date, become eligible for a normal retirement benefit but has not yet retired, in an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of such benefit, based upon the actuarial assumptions in use for purposes of the most recent actuarial valuation, provided that, if such asset value is less than the aggregate of such amounts, such amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such asset value. 
b.  If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionment under subparagraph (3)a., apportionment shall next be made with respect to each employee in the service of the employer on such date who has completed at least ten years of credited service and who is not entitled to an apportionment under subparagraph (3)a., in the amount required to provide the actuarial equivalent, as described in subparagraph (3)a. above, of the accrued normal retirement benefit, based on the credited service and average monthly compensation as of such date, and each vested former participant then entitled to a deferred benefit who has not, by such date, begun receiving benefit payments, in the amount required to provide said actuarial equivalent of the accrued normal retirement benefit, provided that, if such remaining asset value is less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such latter amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
c.  If there is any asset value after the apportionments under subparagraphs (3)a. and (3)b., apportionment shall be made with respect to each employee in the service of the employer on such date who is not entitled to an apportionment under subparagraphs (3)a. and (3)b. in an amount equal to participant's accumulated contributions, provided that, if such remaining asset value is less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder such latter amount shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
d.  If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionments under subparagraphs (3)a., (3)b., and (3)c., apportionment shall lastly be made with respect of each employee included in subparagraph (3)c. above to the extent of the actuarial equivalent, as described in subparagraph (3)a. above, of the accrued normal retirement benefit, less the amount apportioned in subparagraph (3)c., based on the credited service and average monthly compensation as of such date, provided that, if such remaining asset value is less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such amounts shall be reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
e.  In the event there is asset value remaining after the full apportionment specified in subparagraphs (3)a., (3)b., (3)c. and (3)d., such excess shall be returned to the employer. 
(4)  The allocation provided in subparagraph (3) above may, as decided by the trustees, be carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this subparagraph (3). The pension fund may be distributed in one sum to the persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the trustees may direct. The pension fund may be continued in existence for purposes of subsequent distributions. 
(5)  After all the vested accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining amounts of the pension fund revert to the employer.

(4)  Prior to forfeiture, the trustees shall hold a hearing in accordance with F.S. Ch. 120 on which notice shall be given to the participant whose benefits are being considered for forfeiture. 
(5)  If a participant whose benefits are forfeited pursuant to this paragraph has received benefits from the plan in excess of his contributions without interest, such participant shall be required to pay back to the pension fund the amount of the benefits received in excess of his contributions without interest.

(3)  This paragraph shall not apply nor shall the employer be responsible in any manner to defend or pay for claims arising out of acts or omissions of the trustees or members of the committee which constitute felonies or gross malfeasance or gross misfeasance in office.

Except to the extent otherwise required by law or by this plan, the decision of the trustees in matters within their jurisdiction shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the employer, the committee, each employee and beneficiary, and every other interested or concerned person or party. 
(h)  Appointment of advisors. The trustees may appoint such actuaries, accountants, professional investment counsel, legal counsel, specialists, third party pension administrators, and other persons that they deem necessary and desirable in connection with the administration of this plan or to assist them in the performance of their duties as trustees. The trustees are authorized to pay for such services from the pension fund. 
(i)  Actuarial valuation; actuarial standards. 
(1)  At least once in each six-year period, the trustees shall cause an actuarial investigation to be made into the mortality, service and compensation experience of the members of the retirement plan. Taking into account the result of such investigation, the trustees shall adopt for the retirement plan such mortality, service and other tables as are necessary and proper. On the basis of these tables, an annual actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the retirement plan shall be made. 
(2)  Actuarial assumptions based on the six-year experience analysis may be modified by the trustees at such times as they deem appropriate. 
(j)  Defense of actions; trustee liability; indemnification. 
(1)  The board is authorized to prosecute or defend actions, claims or proceedings of any nature or kind for the protection of the fund assets or for the protection of the board in the performance of its duties. 
(2)  Neither the board nor any of its individual members shall have any personal liability for any action taken in good faith. The trustees individually and the board as a whole shall be entitled to the protections in F.S. § 768.28. The trustees shall also be authorized to purchase from the assets of the fund, errors and omission insurance to protect the trustees and staff in the performance of their duties. Such insurance shall not provide the individual trustees and staff with protection against a fiduciary's fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct or gross negligence. 
(3)  To the extent not covered by insurance contracts in force from time to time, the employer shall indemnify and hold harmless the trustees and the members of the committee from all personal liability for damages and costs, including court costs and attorneys' fees, arising out of claims, suits, litigation, or threat of same, herein referred to as "claims," against these individuals because of acts or circumstances connected with or arising out of their official duty as trustees or members of the committee. The employer reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to settle or not settle the claim at any time, and to appeal or to not appeal from any adverse judgment or ruling, and in either event will indemnify and hold harmless any trustees or members of the committee from the judgment, execution, or levy thereon. 
(4)  This section shall not be construed so as to relieve from liability any insurance company or other entity liable to defend the claim or liable for payment of the judgment or claim, nor does this paragraph waive any provision of law affording the employer immunity from any suit in whole or part, or waive any other substantive or procedural rights the employer may have. 
(5)  This section shall not apply to, nor shall the employer be responsible in any manner to defend or pay for claims arising out of, acts or omissions of the trustees or members of the committee which constitute felonies or gross malfeasance or gross misfeasance in office.

(b)  Reemployment. 
(1)  If a participant terminates employment with the employer and receives a return of employee contributions and is subsequently reemployed within the five-year period following his termination of employment, the former participant shall again be eligible to participate in the plan and his credited service shall be based on all periods of employment, provided he

(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee who is reemployed in a regular full-time position other than that of a firefighter or police officer after his benefits have commenced under the plan (other than disability benefits pursuant to section 2.418) shall not be eligible to participate in the plan upon his subsequent reemployment. Reemployment may not commence until at least 30 days after the initial separation from employment with the city. Upon reemployment, the employee will be required to participate in the federal social security program.

Sec. 2.416. - Normal retirement benefit. 
(a)  For non-hazardous duty employees hired prior to the effective date of this restatement, a member shall be eligible for retirement following the earlier of the date on which a participant has reached the age of 55 years and completed 20 years of credited service; the date on which a participant has reached the age of 65 years and completed ten years of credited service; or the date on which a member has completed 30 years of service regardless of age. For non-hazardous duty employees hired on or after the effective date of this restatement, a member shall be eligible for retirement following the earlier of the date on which a participant has reached the age of 60 years and completed 25 years of credited service; or the date on which a participant has reached the age of 65 years and completed ten years of credited service. 
    For hazardous duty employees, a member shall be eligible for retirement following the earlier of the date on which the participant has completed 20 years of credited service regardless of age, which service is of a character or type of employment that is described herein as "hazardous duty" or that the trustees have designated as hazardous duty; or the date on which the participant has reached the age of 55 years and completed ten years of credited service, which service is of a character or type of employment that is described herein as "hazardous duty" or that the trustees have designated as hazardous duty. 
(b)  For non-hazardous duty employees hired prior to the effective date of this restatement, the normal retirement benefit shall be determined by multiplying two and three quarter percent of final average monthly compensation by the number of years of credited service. For non-hazardous duty employees hired on or after the effective date of this restatement, the normal retirement benefit for all credited service shall be determined by multiplying two percent of final average monthly compensation by the number of years of credited service. For hazardous duty employees, the normal retirement benefit for all credited service, which service is of a character or type of employment that is described herein as "hazardous duty" or that the trustees have designated as hazardous duty, shall be determined by multiplying two and three quarter percent of final average monthly compensation by the number of years of credited service.

For non-hazardous duty participants who are not eligible to retire as of the effective date of this restatement, the normal form of benefit shall be an annuity paid monthly for the life of the participant. For all hazardous duty participants and for non-hazardous duty participants who are eligible to retire as of the effective date of this restatement, the normal form of benefit shall be an annuity paid monthly for the life of the participant, with a 100 percent survivor annuity paid monthly for a period of five years following the death of the participant to the beneficiary or beneficiaries described in section 2.420 below; provided, further, that following such five year period the survivor annuity shall be reduced to 50 percent of the original survivor annuity amount, except that, if greater, the normal form of benefit for all hazardous duty participants shall be an annuity paid monthly for the life of the participant with 120 payments guaranteed. The survivor annuity paid to the participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries shall cease following the last day of the month in which occurs the designated beneficiary's death or remarriage if such designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, or the last day of the month in which occurs the designated beneficiary's death or attainment of age 18 if the designated beneficiary is the participant's child or children. However, the surviving spouse of a hazardous duty participant killed in the line of duty shall not have his/her survivor annuity cease upon his/her remarriage in accordance with F.S. § 175.181(3) and F.S. § 185.162(3).

(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.418. - Disability benefits. 
(1)  a.  A participant who is vested in his accrued benefit and who terminates employment by reason of his disability shall be entitled to receive, at the time and in the manner described in section 2.424, a disability benefit equal to his accrued benefit as of the date of termination of his employment. A disability application must be filed while the individual is still a participant in the plan. 
b.  A participant who is deemed by the committee to be disabled by reason of an injury suffered or an illness contracted in the line of duty need not satisfy the vesting requirement set forth in subparagraph (1)a. above; provided, further, that the monthly amount of the disability benefit payable to a participant described in this subparagraph (1)b. shall be 42 percent of such participant's average monthly compensation for a non-hazardous duty participant who is not eligible to retire as of the effective date of this restatement, and the monthly amount of the disability benefit payable to a participant described in this subparagraph (1)b. shall be 66 2/3 percent of such participant's average monthly compensation for all hazardous duty participants and for non-hazardous duty participants who are eligible to retire as of the effective date of this restatement. 
(2)  A participant shall be considered disabled for purposes of the plan if, in the opinion of the committee, the participant is disabled due to sickness or injury, such disability is likely to be continuous and permanent from a cause other than specified in subparagraph (3) below, and such disability renders the participant unable to perform any useful, meaningful and necessary work for the employer in an available position for which the participant is reasonably qualified or for which the participant may be reasonably trained to perform, subject to the limitations below. 
a.  Any police officer or firefighter participant who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer or firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension provided for in subparagraph (1) above. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability pension within 30 days after termination. 
b.  If a participant employed in a position other than as a sworn and state certified police officer or a sworn and state certified firefighter is disabled to the extent that he cannot reasonably continue to perform the functions of his specific position, but remains capable of performing useful, meaningful and necessary work, he may be assigned to an alternate position with the employer in lieu of receiving disability benefits under the plan. For this purpose, the participant may be assigned to any other position with the employer that is available for which the participant has the skill and knowledge to perform or for which the participant can reasonably be trained to perform, such assignment to be with no loss of base pay regardless of whether the assignment to such position is at an equal or lower level. 
c.  A line-of-duty disability based upon a mental injury shall not be granted unless it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the injury was the result of sudden, unexpected and extraordinary stress directly related to the participant's employment. Extra duty assignments for police officers and firefighters shall be considered to be in the line of duty for disability benefit purposes. 
d.  The trustees of the plan shall make the determination in each instance if a participant who has been found disabled may be assigned to an alternate position with the employer. 
(3)  a.  Each participant who is not a police officer or firefighter who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the committee, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
1.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants, or alcohol; 
2.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections; 
3.  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime; 
4.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces; 
5.  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as an employee with the employer shall have terminated; 
6.  Willful, wanton or gross negligence of the participant; 
7.  Injury or disease sustained by the participant while working for anyone other than the employer and arising out of such employment; or 
8.  A condition pre-existing the participant's participation in the plan. No participant shall be entitled to a disability pension, whether in line of duty or not in line of duty, because of or due to the aggravation of a specific injury, impairment or other medical condition pre-existing at the time of participation in the plan, provided that such pre-existing condition and its relationship to a later injury, impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence. 
b.  Each police officer or firefighter participant who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the committee, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by (except that paragraph 5. is only applicable to police officers): 
1.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
2.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
3.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
4.  Injury or disease sustained by the participant after his employment as a police officer or firefighter with the City of Clearwater shall have terminated. 
5.  For police officer participants, injury or disease sustained by the participant while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(4)  a.  A participant shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes an examination by a qualified physician or physicians, who shall be selected by the committee for that purpose. 
b.  1.  Any former participant receiving disability benefits under provisions of this plan may be periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians who shall be selected by the committee to determine if such disability has ceased to exist or if the former participant may be employed in an available position for which the participant is reasonably qualified. If the committee finds that the former participant is no longer disabled or is capable of performing service for the employer, the committee may request the former participant to return to the employ of the employer. If the former participant returns to the performance of duty as an employee, he shall again be eligible to participate in the plan. In the event a former participant is no longer disabled or is deemed capable of returning to employment with the employer and he does not return to employment with the employer pursuant to the committee's request, he shall forfeit the right to his disability benefit; provided further, that if an employee accepts employment with another employer in an occupation or line of work similar to the occupation or line of work that resulted in the employee being eligible for a disability benefit hereunder, he shall forfeit the right to his disability benefit. 
2.  A participant who returns to employment with the employer and recommences participation in the plan shall not receive credited service for the period during which he received disability benefits under the plan. 
c.  The cost of the medical examination and/or re-examination of the employee claiming and/or receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the plan. 
(5)  A participant whose employment is terminated by reason of his death in the line of duty shall, for purposes of the plan, be deemed to have been disabled in the line of duty, and the participant's beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a disability benefit as described in paragraph (1) above. 
(6)  If a participant receives a disability benefit under the plan and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. Ch. 440 for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the participant's average monthly wage as defined in F.S. Ch. 440, excluding overtime, the disability benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the participant does not exceed 100 percent of such wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit of a police officer or firefighter participant be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or two percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(7)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
a.  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a police officer or firefighter participant caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such participant shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram for police officer or firefighter participants, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
b.  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this paragraph b. shall apply only to those conditions described in this paragraph b. that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (7)b., the following definitions apply: 
(i)  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
(ii)  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any participant employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. Ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
(iii)  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
(iv)  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
a)  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
b)  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
c)  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
d)  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
(v)  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety participant who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment and that results in total or partial disability or death, shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the participant must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
(i)  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
a)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
b)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
c)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
d)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
(ii)  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
(iii)  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the participant's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety participant may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the participant's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the participant's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety participant to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the participant from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety participant in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the participant of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety participant shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
(i)  An emergency rescue or public safety participant must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
(ii)  An emergency rescue or public safety participant may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis.

Sec. 2.419. - Termination of employment benefit. 
(1)  In the event a participant's employment with his employer is terminated for reasons other than retirement, disability or death, such participant shall be entitled to receive a termination of employment benefit that is equal to the participant's vested interest in his accrued benefit as of the date of his termination of employment. 
(2)  a.  A participant's vested interest in his accrued benefit shall be the following percentage of his accrued benefit, based upon such participant's full years of credited service as of the date of his termination of employment: 
TOTAL NUMBER OF FULL YEARS 
OF CREDITED SERVICE VESTED 
INTEREST Less than 10 Years of Credited Service 0% 10 years or more 100%  
b.  Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, a participant shall be fully vested in his accrued benefit upon attaining his early retirement date or his normal retirement date. 
(3)  A participant who terminates employment with the employer prior to his early retirement date or his normal retirement date may elect to receive the total contributions he has made to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions. Upon making such election, the participant's interest in his accrued benefit shall be forfeited. 
(4)  If a participant terminates employment prior to his early retirement date or his normal retirement date and receives a distribution of his contributions (plus interest thereon) and is subsequently reemployed and again becomes a participant in this plan, his credited service for purposes of vesting and benefit accruals shall not include any periods of employment prior to his reemployment date unless he repays to the pension fund the greater of (i) the full amount previously distributed to him plus interest at the rate equal to the assumed rate of return under the plan or (ii) the actuarial present value of the accrued benefit previously forfeited. Such repayment must be made no later than the second anniversary of the participant's reemployment. If a participant repays the foregoing amount to the pension fund within the prescribed time period, the interest of the participant in his accrued benefit previously forfeited under subparagraph (3) above shall be restored in full and the participant's credited service shall be based on all periods of employment. 
(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.420. - Death benefit. 
(1)  a.  In the event of the death of a participant who is vested in his accrued benefit prior to his termination of employment, his beneficiary (as described below) shall be entitled to receive a death benefit. Said death benefit shall be in an amount equal to the accrued benefit of such participant as of the date of his death. 
1.  The participant's beneficiary may elect to receive, in lieu of the death benefit under the plan, the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions. Upon making such election, the participant's beneficiary shall forfeit any right to a death benefit under the plan. 
2.  If the participant does not have a beneficiary, the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions, shall be paid to the participant's estate. 
b.  In the event of the death of a participant who is not vested in his accrued benefit prior to his termination of employment, his beneficiary (or, if there is no beneficiary, his estate) shall be entitled to receive the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions. 
(2)  A participant whose employment is terminated by reason of his death in the line of duty shall be deemed, for purposes of the plan, to have been disabled in the line of duty and his benefit shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (5) of section 2.418. 
(3)  The participant's surviving spouse shall be deemed to be the beneficiary designated to receive the death benefit payable under the plan, and if none, his children under the age of 18 who are the participant's dependents (within the meaning of Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code) at the time of his death. 
(4)  If the total contributions made by the participant to the plan, together with five percent simple interest on such contributions, exceed the value of the death benefit paid under the plan, the amount by which such contributions (including interest thereon) exceed the value of the death benefit paid under the plan shall be paid to the participant's beneficiary, or if none, to the participant's estate. 
(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12)

(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.422. - Limitations on amount of benefits. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Subject to the adjustments hereinafter set forth, the maximum amount of annual retirement income payable with respect to a participant under this plan shall not exceed the limits set forth in § 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    For purposes of applying the above limitation, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits shall be adjusted, as provided by treasury regulations, so that such benefits are the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under § 415(b)(2) of the Code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of § 415(b)(1) of the Code. 
(2)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limitation of this section with respect to any participant who at any time has been a participant in any other defined benefit plan (as defined in § 414(j) of the Code) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all defined benefit plans in which the participant has been a participant were payable from one plan. 
(3)  Adjustments in limitations. 
a.  In the event the participant's retirement benefits become payable before age 82, the § 415 limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of § 415(b) of the Code, so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to the § 415 limitation. 
b.  In the event a police officer or firefighter participant's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service, the adjustments provided for in a. above shall not apply. 
c.  The reductions provided for in a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to section 2.418, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 2.420. 
d.  In the event the participant's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 85, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limitation set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 85. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(4)  Less than ten years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any participant who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the participant's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to section 2.418, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 2.420. 
(5)  Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a participant shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such participant under this plan and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the participant participated. 
(6)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the participant's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which participant participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the participant participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such participant. 
(7)  Cost-of-living adjustments. The limitations as stated in subsections (1), (2), and (3) herein shall be adjusted to the time payment of a benefit begins in accordance with any/cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to § 415(d) of the code. 
(8)  This subparagraph (8) shall apply to the amount of benefit (as such term is described below) under this plan for any participant who is considered a restricted participant (as such term is described below). Such benefit shall be limited to an amount equal to the payments that would have been made on behalf of the restricted participant under a life annuity form of payment that is the actuarial equivalent of the restricted participant's accrued benefit under the plan. 
a.  For purposes of this subparagraph (8), the term "benefit" shall include retirement income provided by the plan, plus loans in excess of the amounts set forth in § 72(p)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, any periodic income, any withdrawal values payable to a living participant and any death benefits not provided for by insurance on the participant's life. 
b.  For purposes of this subparagraph (8), the term "restricted participant" shall mean all highly compensated employees. In any one plan year, the total number of participants whose benefits are subject to restriction under this subparagraph (8) shall be limited by the plan to a group of not less than 25 highly compensated employees with the greatest compensation. 
c.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this subparagraph (8) shall not restrict the current payment of the full amount of retirement income provided by the plan if: 
1.  After payment to a restricted participant of all of the benefit described above, the value of plan assets equals or exceeds 100 percent of the value of current liabilities, as defined in § 412(1)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, or 
2.  The value of the benefit described above for a restricted participant is less than one percent of the value of current liabilities, as defined in § 412(1)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code.

2.  No payment shall be made with respect to the month in which participant terminates employment on or after his normal or early retirement date; provided, however, that a full monthly payment will be made for the month in which the participant or his beneficiary dies. 
b.  1.  The amount of the disability benefit to which a participant is entitled shall commence as of the end of the month that next follows the later of (1) the month in which a determination is made as to the participant's disability or (2) the month in which the participant terminates employment, continuing as of the last day of each month thereafter during his lifetime and the lifetime of his beneficiary, if any. With respect to police officer and firefighter participants, 120 payments shall be guaranteed in any event. 
2.  No payment shall be made with respect to the month in which a determination is made as to the participant's disability or the month in which the participant terminates employment; provided, however, that a full monthly payment will be made for the month in which the participant or his beneficiary dies. 
3.  Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 2.424(b)(2)a., 1. or 3., which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
c.  1.  The amount of the termination of employment benefit to which a participant is entitled shall commence as of the earlier of (1) the end of the month that next follows the month in which the participant attains his early retirement date (or would have attained his early retirement date if he had continued in the employ of the employer until his early retirement date) or (2) the end of the month that next follows the month in which the participant attains his normal retirement date (or would have attained his normal retirement date if he had continued in the employ of the employer until his normal retirement date), continuing as of the last day of each month thereafter during his lifetime and the lifetime of his beneficiary, if any. 
2.  No payment shall be made with respect to the month in which the participant attains his early retirement date (or would have attained his early retirement date if he had continued in the employ of the employer until his early retirement date) or his normal retirement date (or would have attained his normal retirement date if he had continued in the employ of the employer until his normal retirement date); provided, however, that a full monthly payment will be made for the month in which the participant or his beneficiary dies. 
d.  1.  The death benefit payable to a participant's beneficiary shall commence as of the end of the month that next follows the month in which the participant dies, continuing as of the last day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of his beneficiary. 
2.  No payment shall be made with respect to the month in which the participant dies; provided, however, that a full monthly payment will be made for the month in which the beneficiary dies. 
(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any distribution paid to a participant (or, in the case of a death benefit, to his beneficiary or beneficiaries) pursuant to subparagraph (1) shall commence not later than the last to occur of: 
a.  April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the participant retires on or after his early retirement date or his normal retirement date; or 
b.  April 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant reaches age 701/2. 
(b)  Manner of payment. 
(1)  a.  The manner of payment of a participant's retirement, disability or termination of employment benefit shall be the normal form of payment described in section 2.416. 
b.  The manner of payment of a participant's death benefit shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of survivor annuity payment described in section 2.416. 
(2)  a.  Options. In lieu of the normal form of payment, a participant may elect at any time after becoming a participant of the Plan to be paid his retirement, disability, death or termination of employment benefit in one of the following optional forms. Should a participant fail to select a payment option prior to death, a named beneficiary shall be entitled to select the payment option. The optional forms, which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit that would otherwise be paid to the participant, are as follows: 
1.  Monthly income payments for the life of the participant. 
2.  Monthly income payments for a ten years certain and life thereafter, under which the participant receives payments during his lifetime and, if he dies after he has begun to receive payments but before he has received 120 payments, the remaining payments shall be made to his designated beneficiary; provided, further, that if the designated beneficiary predeceases the participant, the participant may designate a new beneficiary to receive any payments due after his death. If the participant does not designate a new beneficiary, the payments required under this option following the participant's death shall be paid to the participant's estate. If the designated beneficiary begins to receive payments under this option and such designated beneficiary dies before the end of the ten-year period, the remaining payments shall be paid to the designated beneficiary's estate. 
3.  Monthly income payments for the life of the participant and, after his death, a survivor annuity payable for the life of the participant's designated beneficiary equal to 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of the amount payable to the participant. 
Each participant shall be permitted to change the joint annuitant in a manner consistent with the provisions of F.S. §§ 175.171, 175.333, 185.161, and 185.341. Each designated change shall be evidenced by written instrument filed with the board and shall be effective upon filing with the board. 
4.  A partial lump sum payment equal to either ten percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent of the actuarially determined value of the normal retirement benefit due the member. If a member selects such a partial lump sum distribution, then the monthly retirement benefit shall be reduced accordingly. 
b.  Each participant shall have the right to designate a beneficiary for purposes of the optional forms of benefit payment described in this paragraph and to revoke any such designation. Each designation or revocation shall be evidenced by written instrument filed with the board and shall be effective upon filing with the board. 
(3)  In the case of a retirement, disability or termination of employment benefit, in no event shall payment extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the participant or the joint lives or life expectancies of the participant and his designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before receiving the entire amount payable to him, the balance shall be distributed to his designated beneficiary at least as rapidly as under the method being used prior to the participant's death. 
(4)  In the case of a death benefit; 
a.  Payment to the designated beneficiary shall begin within one year following the participant's death (unless the designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, in which case such benefit shall begin no later than the date the participant would have reached 701/2) and shall not, in any event, extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the designated beneficiary; or 
b.  Payment to any other beneficiary shall be totally distributed within five years from the date of the participant's death. 
(5)  The participant (or his spouse) shall not be permitted to elect whether life expectancies will be recalculated for purposes of distributions hereunder. 
(6)  The committee may purchase and distribute a nontransferable and nonrefundable annuity contract to provide any benefit under the plan paid in the form of an annuity. 
(c)  Lump sum payment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this plan to the contrary, any benefit payable under the plan on or after March 28, 2005, the actuarial lump sum present value of which is not more than $5,000.00, shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the participant's termination of employment. Should the actuarial lump sum value of such payment be greater than $1,000.00, and if the distributee has not elected to have such distribution paid directly to a specified eligible retirement plan, the plan administrator shall make such payment to an individual retirement plan of a designated trustee or issuer and shall notify the distributee in writing (either separately or as part of the notice under section 402(f) of the Code) that the distribution may be transferred to another individual retirement plan. 
(d)  No payment unless sufficient funds. No benefits shall be paid under this plan unless at the time of such benefit payment the pension fund has sufficient assets to pay such benefits; provided, that in the event the assets in the pension fund are not sufficient to pay the benefit amounts due under the plan, the employer shall make additional contributions to the plan pursuant to paragraph (b) of section 2.415. 
(e)  Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distributions. Notwithstanding any provisions of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's (as defined below) election under this paragraph, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the committee, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution (as defined below) paid directly to an eligible retirement plan (as defined below) specified by the distributee in a direct rollover (as defined below). 
(2)  For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
a.  An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(x)(9), and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). Any portion of any distribution which would be includable in gross income will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(a), to an individual retirement annuity described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(b) or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includable. 
b.  An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Internal Revenue Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(a), an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Internal Revenue Code Section 457(e)(1)(A) and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), or a qualified trust described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  A "distributee" includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. 
d.  A "direct rollover" is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.426. - Amendment and termination. 
(a)  Amendment of plan. The city council of the employer shall have continuous power to amend this plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that no such amendment, except as permitted by law: 
(1)  Shall become effective until and unless it is ratified by a majority of the qualified electors of the City of Clearwater voting either in a general election or in a special election called and held for the purpose of ratification or rejection of the amendment; provided, however, that such ratification shall not be required if the amendment is necessary to comply with applicable state or federal law. 
(2)  Shall have the effect of vesting in the employer, directly or indirectly any interest, ownership or control in any of the present or subsequent assets held in the pension fund; 
(3)  Shall cause or permit any property held subject to the terms of the pension fund to be diverted for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries; or 
(4)  Shall reduce the then vested accrued benefit of any participant. 
(5)  Shall reduce or eliminate any benefit in pay status prior to the effective date of the plan, except as otherwise provided under the terms of the plan, prior to the effective date of this amendment and restatement. 
(b)  Termination of plan; discontinuance of contributions. 
(1)  This plan may be terminated in whole or in part at any time by the employer, provided, however, that termination shall not become effective until and unless the decision to terminate is ratified by a majority of the qualified electors of the City of Clearwater voting either in a general or a special election called and held for the purpose of ratification or rejection of plan termination. Upon termination of the plan by the municipality for any reason, or because of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units, services, or functions as provided in chapter 121, or upon written notice to the board of trustees by the municipality that contributions under the plan are being permanently discontinued, the rights of all employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination or discontinuance and the amounts credited to the employees' accounts are nonforfeitable. The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
a.  The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits, after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the municipality if additional assets are required, in which event the municipality shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
b.  The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan, as specified in subsection c. below. 
c.  The board of trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection b. above involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the employee's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the employee. 
d.  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection c. above, and after payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the municipality, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the municipality and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the municipality and the state. 
e.  The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with the manner of distribution determined under subsection b. above, the amounts determined under subsection c. above. 
    If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the municipality or the board of trustees of the municipal police officers' retirement trust fund affected has not complied with all of the provisions of this section, the department of management services shall effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.427. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  Alienation. No participant or beneficiary of a participant shall have any right to assign, transfer, appropriate, encumber, commute, anticipate or otherwise alienate his interest in this plan or the pension fund or any payments to be made thereunder; no benefits, payments, rights or interests of a participant or beneficiary of a participant of any kind or nature shall be in any way subject to legal process to levy upon, garnish or attach the same for payment of any claim against the participant or beneficiary; and no participant or beneficiary of a participant shall have any right of any kind whatsoever with respect to the pension fund, or any estate or interest therein, or with respect to any other property or right, other than the right to receive such distributions as are lawfully made out of the pension fund, as and when the same respectively are due and payable under the terms of this plan. 
(b)  Effect on other plans. Nothing in this plan shall be construed so as to abridge, alter or in any way affect any of the rights or liabilities of an employee of the employer under any other retirement plan in effect as of the effective date of this plan. 
(c)  Receipt of information. Where any action which the committee and/or the trustees are required to take or any duty or function which they are required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to the committee and/or the trustees under this plan can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt from a participant, the employer, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the committee and/or the trustees shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(d)  Overpayments and underpayments. Any overpayments or underpayments from the pension fund to a participant or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate equal to the assumed rate of return under the plan. Overpayment shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction. Underpayments shall be made up from the pension fund. 
(e)  Appointment of agents. Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the trustees may be performed or carried out by the trustees through duly authorized agents, provided that the trustees at all times maintain continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to the pension fund shall always remain in the trustees. 
(f)  Independent audit. An independent audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the employer. Such report shall reflect items normally included in a certified audit. 
(g)  Expenses of administration. 
(1)  a.  The assets of the pension fund may be used to pay all expenses of the administration of the plan and the pension fund, including the compensation of any investment manager, the expense incurred by the trustees or the committee in discharging its duties, all income or other taxes of any kind whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under existing or future laws upon or in respect of the pension fund, and any interest that may be payable on money borrowed by the trustees for the purpose of the pension fund, as well as any settlements or judgments entered with respect to the plan. 
b.  The employer may pay the expenses of the plan and the pension fund. Any such payment by the employer shall not be deemed a contribution to this plan. 
(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no excise tax or other liability imposed upon the trustees or any other person for failure to comply with the provisions of any federal law shall be subject to payment or reimbursement from the assets of the pension fund. 
(3)  No individual trustee or committee member shall be entitled to compensation from the trust (except for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred). 
(Ord. No. 8333-12, § 1, 7-19-12) 
Sec. 2.428. - Physical examination; effect of pre-employment conditions. 
(a)  All employees, as a condition of entry into the retirement plan, shall submit to a uniform physical examination, as may be required by the trustees, for the purpose of determining the existence of pre-existing medical conditions. In lieu of undergoing a pension plan physical examination, an employee shall be required to consent to the trustees' access for the purposes of this section to any physical examination performed by the city. No persons shall be denied entry into the plan on the basis of any pre-existing medical condition. 
(b)  In the event that the physical examination described in this section shall determine the presence of a pre-existing medical condition, said condition shall be reported to the employee and recorded in the records of the trustees. Such employee shall acknowledge the receipt of the medical report and execute a form, as prescribed by the board, indicating knowledge of the pre-existing condition and an agreement that said condition cannot form the basis of a service-incurred disability retirement unless it can be shown that the member would have been entitled to a service-incurred disability retirement allowance on the basis of aggravation of the pre-existing condition. 
(c)  In the event that the member believes the medical report is in error, the member may request a review by the pension advisory committee within 30 days of receipt of notice of the physical examination results. If the initial review does not satisfactorily resolve the question of the pre-existing condition, the member may request a hearing before the pension advisory committee. Failure to request such a review will not preclude a later challenge on this issue. The board shall prescribe uniform rules for the conduct of such hearings.

Sec. 2.445. - Creation, maintenance of funds. 
(1)  Name of plan. A defined contribution plan has been established in accordance with the terms hereof and shall be known as the City of Clearwater Firefighters' Supplemental Trust Fund. 
(2)  Exclusive benefit. This plan is created for the sole purpose of providing benefits to the participants. Except as otherwise permitted by law, in no event shall any part of the principal or income of the trust be paid to or reinvested in the employer or be used for or diverted to any purpose whatsoever other than for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries. 
(3)  Mistake of fact. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of paragraph (2), any contribution made by the employer to this plan by a mistake of fact may be returned to the employer within one year after the payment of the contribution. 
(4)  Participants' rights. The establishment of this plan shall not be considered as giving any employee, or any other person, any legal or equitable right against the employer, the trustee or the principal or the income of the trust, except to the extent otherwise provided by law. The establishment of this plan shall not be considered as giving any employee, or any other person, the right to be retained in the employ of the employer. 
(5)  Qualified plan. This plan and the trust are intended to qualify under the code as a tax-qualified employees' plan and trust, and the provisions of this plan and the trust are to be interpreted accordingly.

(Ord. No. 6281-98, § 1, 5-21-98; Ord. No. 8244-11, § 1(Exh. A), 5-5-11) 
Sec. 2.446. - Membership.

(Ord. No. 6281-98, § 1, 5-21-98; Ord. No. 8244-11, § 1(Exh. A), 5-5-11) 
Sec. 2.447. - Allocations of contributions. 
(1)  Maintenance of accounts. The trustee shall create and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each participant, terminated vested participant, and beneficiary hereunder. Each participant shall have an employer contribution account for his share of employer contributions, forfeitures, and income adjustments relating thereto. The trustee shall maintain a separate account for each participant, terminated participant, and beneficiary. The maintenance of separate accounts, however, is for accounting purposes only, and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required. 
(2)  Allocations of contributions. The contributions of the employer shall be allocated on the first day of each plan year to and among those participants that are entitled to a contribution allocation for the immediately preceding plan year. For example, the employer contribution that was made on October 1, 1990, was allocated among those participants that were entitled to a contribution allocation for the plan year that commenced on October 1, 1989, and terminated on September 30, 1990. For purposes of this subsection (2) those participants that are entitled to a contribution allocation for a particular plan year shall mean those participants that performed services for the employer for the entire prior calendar year, or for a portion of such prior calendar year for which such participant is granted partial credit under subsection (4) hereunder. Except as otherwise provided under subsection (4) with respect to participants that perform a partial prior calendar year of service, such contributions shall be allocated equally among such participants' accounts; that is each participant account shall receive an equal allocation of such contributions. 
(3)  Allocation of income. The trust fund income, except that derived from real estate, shall be allocated monthly during the plan year among the participants' accounts based on the ratio between the account balance of each participant at the time of allocation and the sum of the account balances of all participants at the time of allocation. Trust fund income derived from real estate shall be allocated quarterly based on the above ratio as of the close of the prior quarter. Income shall be allocated to the accounts before the amount of any forfeiture is determined. 
(4)  Partial allocation of contributions. Upon the date that the participant's service with the employer is terminated for any reason, including, but not limited to, retirement, death, or disability, then the following rules shall apply to determine the amount, if any, of the employers contributions that will be allocated to such participant's employer contribution account. For purposes of this subsection (4), the date upon which a participant's service with the employer is deemed terminated (the "termination date") shall be the last day of the calendar month that he officially separates from employment. The amount of any employer contributions that will be allocated to a participant depends on when the termination date occurs. As stated in subsection (2) above, for each complete calendar year of service performed by the participant, such participant shall be entitled to a full, equal share of the employer contribution on the applicable allocation date. If the termination date results in the performance of a partial calendar year of service, then pro rata credit shall be granted for each day of service performed during the period that commences on January 1 and terminates on December 31. The portion of the employer's contribution that will be allocated to such participant's account on the applicable allocation date as a result of such pro rata credit shall equal the product of: (i) an amount equal to the allocation made under subsection (2) on behalf of a participant that performed a full year of service for such plan year, multiplied by (ii) that certain fraction the numerator of which is the number of days for which pro rata credit is granted to such participant, and the denominator of which is 365. 
(5)  No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation for an employer contribution by the trustees to a participant's employer contribution account shall not vest in any participant, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the contributions of the employer except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this plan. 
(6)  Maximum additions. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the System, the annual addition that may be contributed or allocated to a Member's account for any limitation year (limitation year means the calendar year) shall not exceed the lesser of: 
1.  $40,000.00, as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code Section 415(d), or 
2.  100 percent of the Member's compensation for the limitation year (limitation year means the calendar year). 
(b)  Annual addition definition: The term "annual additions" means the amount allocated to a Member's account during the limitation year that is composed of: 
1.  The allocable share of the employer contributions (Chapter 175) for the limitation year. 
2.  The allocable share of forfeitures for the limitation year: and 
3.  Any post-tax employee contributions made during the limitation year. 
(c)  Compensation definition: Solely for purposes of this 415(c) limit, "compensation" means compensation as defined in Code Section 415(c)(3) and shall not exceed the annual limit under Code Section 401(a)(17) (increased pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(17)(B)). In general, Code Section 415(c)(3) defines compensation as all of a Member's wages as defined in Code Section 3401(a) for the purposes of income tax withholding at the source, but determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)); provided, however, compensation shall also include the amount of any elective deferrals, as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3), and any amount contributed or deferred by the Employer at the election of the Member and which is not includible in the gross income of the Member by reason of Code Sections 125, 132(f) (as of January 1, 2001), or 457. Compensation shall not include contributions picked-up pursuant to Code Section 414(h). 
Generally, compensation is the compensation during the applicable limitation year. However, solely for purposes of this 415(c) limit, payments made within two and one-half months after termination, or, if later, the end of the limitation year during which the termination occurred will be taken into account in determining compensation for allocations if they are payments that, absent a termination, would have been paid to the Member while the Member continued in employment with the Employer and are: 
1.  Regular compensation for services during the Member's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the Member's regular work hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments, and the compensation would have been paid to the Member prior to a termination if the Member had continued employment with the Employer; or 
2.  Payments for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave, but only if the Member would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; or 
3.  Payments pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payments would have been paid to the Member at the same time if the Member had continued employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the Member's gross income. 
    Any payments not described above are not considered compensation if paid after termination, even if they are paid within two and one-half months following termination, or, if later, the end of the Plan Year during which the termination occurred, except for payments to the Member who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (within the meaning of Code Section 414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualified military service.

b.  Until a participant actually terminates employment with the employer, he shall not receive a distribution and he shall continue to be treated as a participant.

d.  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Termination benefit. 
a.  In the event that a participant's employment with employer is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to his vested benefit, if any, which shall be paid as provided for in section 2.449. 
(3)  Disability benefit. 
a.  In the event that a participant is determined to be disabled by the board of trustees of the City of Clearwater Employees' Pension Plan, and such disability was incurred in the line of duty, he shall be paid a benefit as provided for in section 2.449. 
b.  In the event that a participant is determined to be disabled by the board of trustees of the City of Clearwater Employees' Pension Plan, and such disability was not incurred in the line of duty, he shall be entitled to his vested benefit, if any, which shall be paid as provided for in section 2.449. 
c.  If the event that a disability retiree is recalled to employment, membership in the system shall be pursuant to the provisions of section 2.446. 
(4)  Death benefit. 
a.  In the event that a participant dies and such death is determined by the plan administrator to have been incurred in the line of duty, he shall be paid a benefit as provided for in section 2.449, to his designated beneficiary, or if none, to his estate. 
b.  In the event that a participant dies and such death is determined by the plan administrator to have not been incurred in the line of duty, he shall be entitled to his vested benefit, if any, which shall be paid as provided for in section 2.449, to his designated beneficiary, or if none, to his estate.

Sec. 2.449. - Vesting and distributions. 
    Except for an in-line of duty incurred disability or death, a member must be employed with the city as a firefighter and a member of the plan for ten or more years to become vested and earn any benefit (account value) from the plan. A member or participant who is not vested shall not receive any benefit from the plan. A vested member who becomes eligible for payment of benefits as provided for in section 2.448 shall receive the value of his account as follows: 
(1)  Initial distribution. Upon entitlement to a benefit, the participant's account value, as determined by the plan administrator, as of the last day of the month in which there was official separation from employment shall be paid. 
(2)  Second distribution. A separated participant shall receive a full share of employer contributions (state insurance premium tax rebate) at the end of the first plan year following the separation from employment as a participant. No earnings or losses shall be credited to or debited from the account. The second distribution may be combined with the initial distribution if previous calendar year employer contributions (SIPTR) have been allocated and credited to the participant's account at the time the initial distribution is made. 
(3)  Final distribution. A separated participant shall receive a pro-rated share of employer contributions (state insurance premium tax rebate) at the end of the second plan year (or first plan year if a combined initial and second distribution was made) following the separation from employment as a participant. The pro-rated share shall be determined by dividing the total number of man days for the prior calendar year into the total amount of the state insurance premium tax rebate monies received from such prior calendar year, then multiplying such quotient by the total number of calendar days that the separated participant actually worked as a member in such prior calendar year. No earnings or losses shall be credited to or debited from the account. 
(Ord. No. 6281-98, § 1, 5-21-98; Ord. No. 8244-11, § 1(Exh. A), 5-5-11) 
Sec. 2.450. - Termination of system. 
(1)  Upon termination of the system for any reason, the fund shall be apportioned and distributed in accordance with section 2.449 to the extent permitted by the state insurance premium tax rebate monies. The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value to be distributed upon termination of the system. 
(Ord. No. 6281-98, § 1, 5-21-98; Ord. No. 8244-11, § 1(Exh. A), 5-5-11) 
Sec. 2.451. - Direct transfer of eligible rollover distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distributions. 
(a)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income.

(4)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

(e)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)-21.

Sec. 2.471. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subdivision, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a difference meaning: 
    Board means the board of trustees of the police officers pension trust fund as provided for in this subdivision. 
    Net credit means the amount standing to the credit of a participant's share account as at the end of the preceding fiscal year. 
    Participant means every police officer of the city eligible to have moneys credited to his share account and to receive benefits therefrom pursuant to this subdivision. 
    Pension trust fund means the police officers' fund as provided for in this subdivision. 
    Police officer means any person who is elected, appointed, or employed full time by the city and certified or required to be certified as a law enforcement officer in compliance with F.S. § 943.14, who is vested with the authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, criminal, traffic, or highway laws of the state. The term includes all certified supervisory and command personnel whose duties include, in whole or in part, the supervision, training, guidance, and management responsibilities of full-time law enforcement officers, part-time law enforcement officers, or auxiliary law enforcement officers, but does not include part-time law enforcement officers or auxiliary law enforcement officers as defined in F.S. § 943.10(5) and (7). The term shall specifically exclude any person employed in the entry level position of police recruit I who is not certified or required to be certified as a law enforcement officer, and any other employee of the city not certified or required to be certified as a law enforcement officer and not employed full time as a sworn law enforcement officer. 
    Service means all time served as a police officer of the city for which regular compensation is paid by the city and all time during which a participant is on military leave in active military service and subject to the application of F.S. ch. 115.

Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1.02. 
Sec. 2.472. - Entitlement; allocation. 
(1)  Each participant shall be entitled to one share or a fractional share in the fund for each full year or a portion of a year of service as a police officer of the city. A fractional share for service rendered by each participant shall be determined by the number of days of service in each calendar year, assuming a 365-day year. 
(2)  The total moneys received, including interest earned, any gifts and the credits forfeited by the participants, all of which constitute income to the fund during each fiscal year, shall be allocated and the value of the respective participant's shares shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  The board shall pay all costs and expenses of management and operation of the last date of employment as a participant. 
(b)  The board shall set aside as much of the income as it considers advisable as a reserve for expenses for the then current fiscal year. 
(c)  After deducting the moneys called for in subsections (2)(a) and (b) of this section, the remaining moneys shall be allocated and credited to the share accounts of the respective participants. 
(3)  The number of shares to which each and every participant is entitled as of the last date of employment as a participant, shall be added together and the total number of shares thus determined shall be divided into the net amount of money available to be allocated and credited to the respective share accounts. The amount to be credited to the account of each participant will then be obtained by multiplying the value determined for one share by the total number of shares to which each participant is entitled. 
(4)  Based on the asset balance of the pension trust fund on September 30 of each year, the value of each participant's share shall be calculated and credited to his share account. Such calculation shall be made and credits allocated to his share account once only in each fiscal year. Prorations shall be made to the last date of employment as a participant. 
(5)  Maximum additions. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the System, the annual addition that may be contributed or allocated to a Member's account for any limitation year (limitation year means the calendar year) shall not exceed the lesser of: 
1.  $40,000.00, as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under code section 415(d), or 
2.  100 percent of the Member's compensation for the limitation year (limitation year means the calendar year). 
(b)  Annual addition definition: The term "annual additions" means the amount allocated to a Member's account during the limitation year that is composed of: 
1.  The allocable share of the employer contributions (Chapter 185 monies) for the limitation year. 
2.  The allocable share of forfeitures for the limitation year; and 
3.  Any post-tax employee contributions made during the limitation year. 
(c)  Compensation definition: Solely for purposes of this 415(c) limit, "compensation" means compensation as defined in code section 415(c)(3) and shall not exceed the annual limit under code section 401(a)(17) (increased pursuant to code section 401(a)(17)(B)). In general, code section 415(c)(3) defines compensation as all of a Member's wages as defined in code section 3401(a) for the purposes of income tax withholding at the source, but determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2)); provided, however, compensation shall also include the amount of any elective deferrals, as defined in code section 402(g)(3), and any amount contributed or deferred by the Employer at the election of the Member and which is not includible in the gross income of the Member by reason of code sections 125, 132(f) (as of January 1, 2001), or 457. Compensation shall not include contributions picked-up pursuant to code section 414(h). 
Generally, compensation is the compensation during the applicable limitation year. However, solely for purposes of this 415(c) limit, payments made within two and one-half months after termination, or, if later, the end of the limitation year during which the termination occurred will be taken into account in determining compensation for allocations if they are payments that, absent a termination, would have been paid to the member while the Member continued in employment with the Employer and are: 
1.  Regular compensation for services during the Member's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the Member's regular work hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments, and the compensation would have been paid to the member prior to a termination if the Member had continued employment with the Employer; or 
2.  Payments for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave, but only if the Member would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; or 
3.  Payments pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payments would have been paid to the Member at the same time if the Member had continued employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the Member's gross income. 
    Any payments not described above are not considered compensation if paid after termination, even if they are paid within two and one-half months following termination, or, if later, the end of the plan year during which the termination occurred, except for payments to the Member who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (within the meaning of code section 414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualified military service.

Each resident member shall serve as trustee for a period of four years unless sooner replaced by the city council, at whose pleasure he will serve.

    The board of trustees shall not invest more than five percent of its assets in the common stock or capital stock on any one issuing company, the aggregate investment on any one issuing company shall not exceed five percent of the outstanding capital stock of that company, nor shall the aggregate of its investments in common or capital stock or convertible securities at market exceed 65 percent of the fund's assets. 
(2)  At least once every three years, the board of trustees shall retain an independent consultant professionally qualified to evaluate the performance of professional money managers. The independent consultant shall make recommendations to the board of trustees regarding the selection of money managers for the next investment term. These recommendations shall be considered by the board of trustees at its next regularly scheduled meeting after receipt of the recommendations by the board. The date, time, place, and subject of this meeting shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. 
(3)  The sole and exclusive administration of and the responsibilities for the proper operation of the retirement trust fund and for making effective the provisions of this subdivision are vested in the board of trustees, provided that nothing in this subdivision shall empower the board of trustees to amend the provisions of a retirement plan without the approval of the city council. 
(4)  The trustees of the pension plan established pursuant to this subdivision and all other persons occupying a fiduciary position under this subdivision in the administration of this subdivision and in investing and reinvesting assets of the pension fund shall utilize and be governed by the prudent man rule.

Sec. 2.475. - Death and disability benefits. 
(1)  If a participant shall die while employed by the city, his beneficiary or estate shall be entitled to the accumulations standing to the credit of the deceased participant, irrespective of the age or years of credited service of the participant. 
(2)  Upon satisfactory proof to the board of trustees of total and permanent job-related disability which renders the affected participating member unable to perform the duties and functions of a police officer, a participant will be entitled to receive his outstanding shares on the date of retirement. In the event that the City of Clearwater Employees' Pension Plan has determined that a police officer has become permanently incapacitated through injury or illness contracted in the line of duty, such determination may be considered as proof of a job-related disability under this Police Officers' Pension Plan.

Sec. 2.480. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distributions. 
(a)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002.

Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includable in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includable ; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in code section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in code section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(2)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
(3)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse.

(b)  In the event that the annual additions, under the normal administration of the plan, would otherwise exceed the limits set forth above for any participant, or in the event that any participant participates in both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan maintained by the employer and the aggregate annual additions to and projected benefits under all of such plans, under the normal administration of such plans, would otherwise exceed the limits provided by law, then the plan administrator shall take such actions, applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, as will keep the annual additions and projected benefits for such participant from exceeding the applicable limits provided by law. Adjustments shall be made to other plans, if necessary to comply with such limits, before any adjustments may be made to this plan.

(Ord. No. 8612-14, § 2(Exh. A, Art. VII, § 7.3), 10-15-14) 
Subdivision VIII. - Form and Payment of Benefits 

Sec. 2.509. - Timing and form. 
(a)  (1)  Except as otherwise provided in this Subdivision VIII, the amount of the retirement or death benefit to which a participant is entitled under sections 2.506 and 2.508 shall be paid to him or, in the case of a death benefit, shall be paid to said participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries as soon as practicable following the participant's actual retirement following his normal retirement date or death, as the case may be. 
(2)  The amount of the termination of employment benefit to which a participant is entitled under section 2.507 shall be paid to him as soon as practicable following his termination of employment. 
(3)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), above, a participant may elect to defer the distribution of his benefit until any subsequent date elected by the participant in writing pursuant to such procedures as the plan administrator may adopt, but in no event later than the date described in 2.509(b). 
(b)  (1)  Effective January 1, 2003, all distributions from the plan will be determined and made in accordance with the treasury regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and shall take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. Any distribution paid to a participant (or, in the case of a death benefit, to his beneficiary or beneficiaries) shall commence not later than: 
(i)  April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the participant retires on or after his normal retirement date; or 
(ii)  April 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant reaches age 701/2. 
(2)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(A)  Death of participant before distributions begin. If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(i)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then, except as provided in Section 8.1(b)(2)(A)(v), distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
(ii)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then, except as provided in Section 8.1(b)(2)(A)(v), distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(iv)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, section 2.509(b)(2)(A), other than section 2/509(b)(2)(A)(i), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(v)  Participants or beneficiaries may elect on an individual basis whether the five-year rule or the life expectancy rule in this section 2.509(b)(2)(A) and section 2.509(b)(4) applies to distributions after the death of a participant who has a designated beneficiary. The election must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distribution would be required to begin under this section 2.509(b)(2)(A), or by September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the participant's (or, if applicable, surviving spouse's) death. If neither the participant nor beneficiary makes an election under this paragraph, distributions will be made in accordance with this section 2.509(b)(2)(A) and section 2.509(b)(4) below. 
For purposes of this section 2.5098.1(b)(2)(A) and section 2.509(b)(4), unless 2.509(b)(2)(A)(iv) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If section 2.509(b)(2)(A)(iv) above applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under section 2.509(b)(2)(A)(i) above. If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the participant before the participant's required beginning date (or to the participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under section 2.509(b)(2)(A)(i), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(B)  Forms of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with sections 2.509(b)(3) and 8.1(b)(4). If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. 
(3)  Required minimum distributions during participant's lifetime. 
(A)  Amount of required minimum distribution for each distribution calendar year. During the participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year is the lesser of: 
(i)  The quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the distribution calendar year; or 
(ii)  If the participant's sole designated beneficiary for the distribution calendar year is the participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the number in the joint and last survivor table set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar year. 
(B)  Lifetime required minimum distributions continue through year of participant's death. Required minimum distributions will be determined under this section 2.509(b)(3) beginning with the first distribution calendar year and up to and including the distribution calendar year that includes the participant's date of death. 
(4)  Required minimum distributions after participant's death. 
(A)  Death on or after date distributions begin. 
(i)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the longer of the remaining life expectancy of the participant or the remaining life expectancy of the participant's designated beneficiary, determined as follows: 
(1)  The participant's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
(2)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as of the spouse's birthday in that year. For distribution calendar years after the year of the surviving spouse's death, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year. 
(3)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the beneficiary in the year following the year of the participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
(ii)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the participant's remaining life expectancy calculated using the age of the participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
(B)  Death before date distributions begin. 
(i)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. Except as provided in Section 2.509(b)(2)(A)(v) above, if the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the remaining life expectancy of the participant's designated beneficiary, determined as provided in section 2.509(b)(4)(A) above. 
(ii)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(iii)  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse are required to begin. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin, the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under section 2.509(b)(2)(A)(i) above, this section (4) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(5)  Definitions. 
(A)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Code Section 401(a)(9) and Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4 of the Code. 
(B)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately proceeding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under section 2.509(b)2 above. The required minimum distribution for the participant's first distribution calendar year will be made on or before the participant's required beginning date. The required minimum distribution for other distribution calendar years, including the required minimum distribution for the distribution calendar year in which the participant's required beginning date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that distribution calendar year. 
(C)  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Code. 
(D)  Participant's account balance. The account balance as of the last valuation date in the calendar year immediately preceding the distribution calendar year (valuation calendar year) increased by the amount of any contributions made and allocated or forfeitures allocated to the account balance as of dates in the valuation calendar year after the valuation date and decreased by distributions made in the valuation calendar year after the valuation date. The account balance for the valuation calendar year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the plan either in the valuation calendar year or in the distribution calendar year if distributed or transferred in the valuation calendar year. 
(c)  With respect to distributions under the plan made for the 2002 calendar year, the plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code in accordance with the regulations under Section 401(a)(9) that were proposed on January 17, 2001, notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary.

Sec. 2.510. - Manner of payment. 
(a)  A participant's retirement, death or termination of employment benefit may be paid in one of the following optional forms as elected by the participant, or in the case of a death benefit, by the participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries. The optional forms are as follows:

(2)  Monthly, quarterly or annual installments over a fixed period of time, not exceeding the life of the participant or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and his designated beneficiary. 
(b)  A participant or his beneficiary may elect to receive the payment of any part or all of the unpaid installments under paragraph 2.510(a)(2) above in a lump sum, in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the plan administrator (and in accordance with the Code). 
(c)  Each participant shall have the right to designate a beneficiary for purposes of the optional form of benefit payment described in paragraph 2.510(a)(2) above and to revoke any such designation. Each designation or revocation shall be evidenced by written instrument filed with the Employer and shall be effective upon filing with the employer. 
(d)  In the case of a retirement or termination of employment benefit, in no event shall payment extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the participant or the joint lives or life expectancies of the participant and his designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before receiving the entire amount payable to him, the balance shall be distributed to his designated beneficiary at least as rapidly as under the method being used prior to the participant's death. 
(e)  In the case of a death benefit, payment: 
(1)  To the designated beneficiary shall begin within one year following the participant's death (unless the designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, in which case such benefit shall begin no later than the date the participant would have reached 701/2) and shall not, in any event, extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the designated beneficiary; or

Should the actuarial lump sum value of such a payment be greater than $1,000.00, and if the distributee has not elected to have such distribution paid directly to a specified eligible retirement plan, the plan administrator shall make such payment to an individual retirement plan of a designated trustee or issuer and shall notify the distributee in writing (either separately or as part of the notice under section 402(f) of the Code) that the distribution may be transferred to another individual retirement plan. 
(Ord. No. 8612-14, § 2(Exh. A, Art. VIII, § 8.3), 10-15-14; Ord. No. 8650-14, § 1, 12-18-14)

Sec. 2.510.3. - Location of participant or beneficiary unknown. 
    In the event that all, or any portion of the distribution payable to a participant or his beneficiary, hereunder shall remain unpaid after five plan years solely by reason of the inability of the plan administrator, after sending a registered letter, return receipt requested, to the last known address, and after further diligent effort, to ascertain the whereabouts of such participant or his beneficiary, the amount so distributable shall be treated as a forfeiture. In the event a participant or beneficiary of such participant is located subsequent to his benefit being reallocated, such benefit shall be restored by an additional contribution by the employer.

(2)  Emergency appropriations. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public welfare, the city council may make emergency appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by emergency ordinance.

(4)  Transfer of appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year the city manager may for reasons of economy or efficiency, transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance among programs within an operating fund, provided such action does not result in the discontinuance of a program. The city manager may transfer appropriations within the capital budget provided such transfer does not result in changing the scope of any project or the fund source included in the adopted capital budget.

Upon detailed written request by the city manager, the city council may by ordinance transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance from one fund to another. 
(5)  Limitations; effective date. No appropriation for debt service may be reduced or transferred except where such reduction or transfer is surplus and will not jeopardize the specific debt service requirements.

The department director shall obtain the approval of the city manager to require a bond for less than the full contract price before proceeding with the bid process. If such bond is required, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids. Bonds required hereunder shall be subject to all other provisions of this section and the Code.

Subdivision IV. - Outline Procedures for Awarding Design-Build Contracts 

Sec. 2.601. - Award of design-build contracts. 
(1)  Purpose. This ordinance establishes uniform rules for the procurement and administration of design-build contracts for construction projects as contemplated by F.S. § 287.055. 
(2)  Selection of the design criteria professional. The design criteria professional shall be selected and contracted in accordance with the requirements of F.S. § 287.055(4) and (5), unless he or she is an employee of the city. The design criteria professional that prepares the design criteria package will not be eligible to render services under the design-build contract. 
(3)  Design criteria package requirements. A design criteria package shall be prepared for the city by the design criteria professional. It shall specify performance criteria for the project including, but not limited to, size, net interior space provisions, location, material quality standards, cost, construction schedule, site development requirements, landscaping, grading, utility provisions for water, power, telephone, storm water disposal and parking provisions. The purpose of the package is to furnish sufficient information upon which firms may prepare bid proposals or upon which negotiations may be based. The firm to whom the design-build contract is awarded will be responsible for creation of the project design based on the criteria in the design criteria package. 
(4)  Minimum qualification requirements for firms providing design-build services. Firms must be qualified pursuant to rules of qualification for bid submittals found in Division 3, Purchasing, of the Code of Ordinances. 
(5)  Public announcement procedures. The city shall publicly request, in a newspaper of general circulation and by posting notice at its offices, competitive proposals from design-build firms. The request shall provide a general description of the project and define procedures on how interested qualified firms may apply for consideration. 
(6)  Certification and competitive selection. 
(a)  The city shall determine the relative ability of each firm to perform the services required for each project. Determination of ability shall be based on staff training and experience, firm experience, location, volume of past contracts with the agency, financial capacity, past performance, and current and projected workloads. In making its determination the city shall interview no less than three firms to determine the firms' ability to provide services and commitment to meet time and budget requirements. 
(b)  The city shall select no less than three nor more than six firms deemed to be most highly qualified to perform the required services, after considering the factors in (1) above. Each of these firms will be eligible for consideration in accordance with subsections (g) or (h), infra. 
(c)  The city may determine that it is in the best interest of the city to negotiate instead of inviting competitive proposals when: 
i.  The project is one with standard requirements such as an office building or a storage warehouse; or 
ii.  The project requires special expertise; or 
iii.  There is a need to complete the project on an accelerated schedule. 
(d)  When the city determines in writing that an emergency exists, a firm shall be selected by competitive negotiation under subsection (h), infra. 
(7)  Competitive proposals for design-build services. 
(a)  Unless negotiation is authorized, proposals will be received from those qualified firms determined eligible under subsection (f), supra. Proposals shall include proposed price and a conceptual design in response to the design criteria package. The city shall establish a relative weighing factor, that is, a maximum permissible score in the form of a percentage, for each proposed building system component of the design criteria package. The weighing factors shall total 100 percent. The city shall review the conceptual design proposed by each firm and give each component a score somewhere between zero and the maximum permissible score (the weighing factor) for the component. 
(b)  The city will then total the score given for each proposed component and divide that score into the price proposed. The quotient will be the adjusted price. The low qualified proposer will then be that proposer whose adjusted price is lowest. The city shall approve an award to the firm with the lowest adjusted price and enter into a contract for the proposed price if the price is within the project budget. 
(8)  Competitive negotiation for design-build services. 
(a)  If negotiation is authorized, the city shall select no less than three firms in order of preference from those deemed to be most qualified to perform the required services under subsection (e), supra. In making its determination the city shall interview no less than three firms to determine their relative ability to meet time and budget requirements and to identify and establish the relative merits of each firm's approach to managing and scheduling the project. The city will then attempt to negotiate a contract with the most qualified firm.

Sec. 5.21. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm system means any mechanical, electrical, or radio-controlled device which is designed to be used for the detection of fire within a building or structure or portion thereof, and which emits a sound or transmits a signal or message when activated. The term does not include smoke detectors connected to an alarm system that is a part of a single-family or two-family structure, and the term does not include alarm systems installed in structures used by government agencies for public purposes. 
    Alarm user means the person in control of the premises wherein an alarm system is maintained. If a lessee of the premises is responsible for ensuring the proper maintenance of the alarm system, then the lessee shall be considered the alarm user. 
    Automatic telephone dialing device or digital alarm communicator alarm system means an alarm system which is activated by a signal or message and which automatically sends a prerecorded voice message or coded signal by microwave, telephone lines, or other mode of transmittal directly to the county 911 line or directly to the police or fire department, indicating the existence of an emergency situation that the alarm system is designed to detect. 
    Code enforcement officer means the fire chief or other employee of the fire department designated to enforce the provisions of this article. 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligent or intentional misuse of the alarm system by the alarm user or an employee. It may be presumed that the alarm was false if the enforcement official finds, at the time of the fire response, no evidence of a fire-related emergency. An alarm shall not be considered false if: 
(a)  The alarm system was activated under circumstances that would have caused a careful or prudent person to believe that a fire-related emergency was in progress at the premises protected by the alarm system; or 
(b)  The alarm system was activated by conditions clearly beyond the control of the alarm user, including but not limited to severe weather conditions. 
    Premises means any building or structure or portion thereof protected by an alarm system. In the case of two or more buildings or structures or portions thereof on the same property under the same ownership protected by alarm systems that are not connected to a single control system, each building or structure or portion thereof shall be deemed to be separate and distinct premises. 
    Same premises means at the same building or structure or portion thereof protected by an alarm system, without regard to alterations therein, if the identity of the alarm user has not materially changed since the last false alarm report. For example, but without limiting the meaning of this definition, a bona fide sale of the premises or the business therein to a third party or the replacement of a tenant by a different tenant shall be deemed a material change of the identity of the alarm user.

Subsequent false alarms occurring at the same premises within the same calendar year shall result in a doubling of the civil penalty as provided for a class II violation. 
(2)  It shall be a civil infraction for any person to install or continue to use a faulty alarm system or to negligently maintain an alarm system in such a manner that the alarm system generates false alarms. The first response to the alarm user's premises within any calendar year determined to have been false shall result in the city's issuance of a written courtesy warning to the alarm user. Any additional false alarms occurring at the same premises within the same calendar year as the date of the first response shall constitute a separate civil infraction. In bringing a case before the county court, it shall be immaterial whether false alarms are generated by a fault in an alarm system, by the negligent maintenance of an alarm system or by some combination thereof. 
(Code 1980, § 94.02; Ord. No. 5134, § 5, 9-19-91; Ord. No. 7193-03, § 2, 11-6-03) 
Sec. 5.25. - Response to false alarms; issuance of courtesy warnings and citations. 
(1)  Whenever an alarm system is activated within the city's jurisdiction, thereby requiring a response to the premises, the code enforcement officer on the scene shall inspect the premises, investigate the cause for the alarm, and determine whether or not the response was in fact required. If the code enforcement officer determines the alarm to be false, the officer shall prepare a false alarm report; and a written courtesy warning shall be issued to the alarm user by regular United States mail or hand delivery. 
(2)  The written courtesy warning shall notify the alarm user that any additional false alarms occurring at the same premises within the same calendar year as the date of the first response shall result in a citation being issued to appear in county court. 
(3)  If the fire department responds to the activation of an alarm at the same premises where the alarm user has been or was going to be issued a courtesy warning, if the alarm occurs within the same calendar year as the date of the first response, and if after inspecting the premises and investigating the cause for the alarm, the code enforcement officer determines the alarm was false, then the alarm user shall be issued a citation to appear in county court. 
(4)  The issuance of a courtesy warning to the alarm user is not intended to create any rights in the alarm user. The city could have issued a citation rather than a warning after the first response to the premises where the enforcement official determined no response was in fact required. The issuance of a courtesy warning is merely a courtesy offered by the city to induce the alarm user to take corrective actions to prevent false alarms. 
(5)  The code enforcement officer shall have the right to inspect any alarm system to determine whether the alarm system is being used in conformance with the terms of this article. 
(6)  If code enforcement officers respond to the same premises more than once during any eight-hour period, only one false alarm will be chargeable against the alarm user. For example, if a false alarm occurs at the alarm user's premises at 2:00 a.m., the next chargeable false alarm could not occur until 10:01 a.m.

ARTICLE III. - SECURITY ALARM SYSTEMS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 5.41. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm permit means a permit issued by the city allowing the operation of a security alarm system within the city. 
    Alarm user means the person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization of any kind in control of any building, structure or facility or portion thereof wherein a security alarm system is maintained. If the lessee of the premises is responsible for ensuring the proper maintenance of the security alarm system, then the lessee shall be considered the alarm user. 
    Automatic telephone dialing device or digital alarm communicator alarm system means an alarm system which is activated by a signal or message and which automatically sends a prerecorded voice message or coded signal by microwave, telephone line, or other mode of transmittal directly to the county 911 line or directly to the police or fire department, indicating the existence of an emergency situation that the alarm system is designed to detect. 
    Date of receipt means, for a residential user, the date that the return receipt accompanying any certified mailing of a notice required by this article to be sent to the alarm user's residence is signed or the date that any notice required by this article is delivered to the alarm user personally or to any person 15 years of age or older residing with the alarm user after informing the person of the contents of the notice. For business alarm users, the term means the date the return receipt accompanying any certified mailing of a notice required by this article to be sent to the alarm user's premises is signed or the date any notice required by this article is delivered to the person designated in the alarm permit application to receive notices, or to any employee, if the person so designated is not present on the premises, after notifying the employee of the contents of the notice. 
    False alarm means the activation of a security alarm system resulting in a police response caused by the mechanical failure, mechanical malfunction, improper maintenance, or faulty installation of the system, regardless of whether the alarm user is at fault; or the negligent or intentional activation of the sensors of a security alarm system by an act or omission of the alarm user, a person residing on the alarm user's premises or an employee of the alarm user, including but not limited to opening doors or windows protected by sensors, walking through or walking on areas protected by sensors, or failing to prevent the activation of sensors by animals or objects over which the alarm user, a person residing on the alarm user's premises, or an employee of the alarm user has or reasonably should have control. An alarm is not false if the security alarm system is activated by conditions that were not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user, such as severe weather conditions, or under circumstances that would have caused a careful and prudent person to believe that criminal activity or an emergency was in progress at the premises. It may be presumed that the alarm was false if the police officer responding to the alarm finds no evidence of criminal activity, attempted criminal activity, or an emergency at the premises. 
    Permit year means from October 1 to September 30 of the next calendar year. 
    Premises means any building or structure or portion thereof protected by a security alarm system. 
    Same premises means at the same building or structure or portion thereof protected by a security alarm system, without regard to alterations therein, if the identity of the alarm user has not materially changed since the last false alarm report. For example, but without limiting the meaning of the definition, a bona fide sale of the premises or the business therein to a third party or the replacement of a tenant by a different tenant shall be deemed a material change of the identity of the alarm user. 
    Security alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other criminal activity or of an emergency to a monitoring facility that contacts the police department and requests a police officer to respond to the alarm user's premises. The term also includes any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, that emits an audible or visual signal designed to be heard or seen outside the alarm user's premises indicating the occurrence of an illegal entry or other criminal activity or of an emergency on the alarm user's premises. The term includes but is not limited to intrusion alarms, holdup alarms, and panic alarms, but does not include fire alarms or alarms installed in motor vehicles. 
(Code 1980, § 94.07) 
Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1.02. 
Sec. 5.42. - Liability of city. 
    The city and any of its agents and employees shall have no liability or responsibility for the operation or effectiveness of any alarm system and shall not be subject to any claims, demands or actions which may arise out of or in connection with the failure to respond to an alarm. 
(Code 1980, § 94.16) 
Sec. 5.43. - Prohibited systems. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or corporate, to sell, offer for sale, install, maintain, lease, operate or assist in the operation of an automatic telephone dialing device or digital alarm communicator alarm system within the city. 
(Code 1980, § 94.15) 
Sec. 5.44. - Required equipment; penalty for violation. 
(1)  All security alarm systems connected to electrical lines shall have a backup power supply that will become effective in the event of power failure or outage. 
(2)  All business security alarm systems shall have an automatic reset that silences the annunciator within 30 minutes after activation. All residential security alarm systems shall have an automatic reset that silences the annunciator within 20 minutes after activation. 
(3)  An alarm user shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 for each day the alarm user operates a security alarm system in violation of this section. 
(Code 1980, § 94.11; Ord. No. 9104-18, § 1, 4-4-18) 
Sec. 5.45. - Response to alarm; determination of validity. 
(1)  Whenever an alarm is activated in the city, thereby requiring an emergency response to the location by the police department, and the police department does respond, a police officer on the scene of the activated security alarm system shall inspect the area protected by the system and shall determine whether the emergency response was in fact required as indicated by the security alarm system or whether a false alarm occurred. 
(2)  If the police officer at the scene of the activated security alarm system determines the alarm to be false, the officer shall make a report of the false alarm. 
(3)  If police officers respond to the same premises more than once during any eight-hour period, only one false alarm will be chargeable against the alarm user. For example, if a false alarm occurs at the alarm user's premises at 2:00 a.m., the next chargeable false alarm could not occur until 10:01 a.m. 
(Code 1980, § 94.12) 
Sec. 5.46. - Service charge for false alarms. 
(1)  It is hereby found and determined that one or more false alarms within any permit year constitutes a public nuisance. 
(2)  The first activation within a permit year of an alarm user's permitted security alarm system determined by the responding police officer to have been a false alarm shall result in the city's issuance to the alarm user of a written courtesy warning by regular United States mail or by hand delivery. The issuance of a courtesy warning to the alarm user is not intended to create any rights of the alarm user. The city could have issued a notice of a false alarm and could have requested the payment of a service charge rather than issuing a warning. The issuance of a courtesy warning is merely a courtesy offered by the city to induce the alarm user to take corrective actions to prevent false alarms. The first activation within a permit year of an alarm user's unpermitted security alarm system determined by the responding police officer to have been a false alarm shall result in a service charge, unless the alarm user registers their security alarm system pursuant to section 5.61 within 30 days of the receipt of the notice of service charge. However, an alarm user who obtains a permit for their unpermitted security alarm system and receives a courtesy warning instead of a service charge will still have accumulated one false alarm in that permit year for purposes of the escalating service charge schedule in paragraph (3) of this section. 
(3)  The activation at the same premises of one or more false alarms within a permit year after the date of the response that resulted in the city's issuance of a written courtesy warning shall result in the city's issuing to the alarm user a written notice of the false alarm and a notice of the city's imposition on the alarm user of a service charge per the following table, which shall be considered a bill owed by the alarm user to the city: 
Permit No Permit Alarm Calls Fine Alarm Calls Fine First No Fine First $50.00 Second- 
 Fifth $50.00 each Second- 
 Fifth $100.00 each Sixth + $100.00 each Sixth + $150.00 each  
    Each service charge shall be paid to the police department within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the written notification of the service charge. If the police department does not receive payment of the service charge within such time and if the alarm user fails to take an appeal by requesting a hearing as provided by this article within 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the false alarm notice, the alarm user's permit for the premises shall become automatically revoked, and the notice shall so state. 
(4)  If the alarm user's permit has been revoked pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the alarm permit shall not be reinstated until the alarm user pays all outstanding service charges. 
(5)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any new installation of an alarm system for the first 30 calendar days following the date the alarm system becomes operable. 
(Code 1980, § 94.14; Ord. No. 6638-01, § 1, 2-1-01; Ord. No. 9104-18, § 1, 4-4-18) 
Sec. 5.47. - Appeals. 
(1)  Within 15 calendar days from the date of receipt by the alarm user of any notice of a false alarm, the alarm user shall file with the city clerk's office a written request for a hearing if the alarm user chooses to contest the validity of the false alarm, and the false alarm notice shall so state. The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $25.00 which will be refunded to the alarm user if the false alarm is determined to have been genuine or beyond the control of the alarm user. 
(2)  The city manager or his/her designee shall hold a hearing within 20 calendar days from the date the alarm user files the request for a hearing with the city clerk's office. The alarm user shall be given notice of the hearing and shall have an opportunity to present evidence on his behalf, to cross-examine any witnesses, and to be represented by counsel. Within ten calendar days of the hearing, the city manager or his/her designee shall file with the city clerk's office a written decision upholding or canceling the false alarm report. The written decision shall be final and conclusive, subject to judicial review by common law certiorari in the circuit court for the county. 
(3)  If the alarm user is unsuccessful in having the city manager or his/her designee declare the false alarm to be genuine or beyond the control of the alarm user and if the alarm user fails to seek further review in the circuit court, the alarm user shall have 30 calendar days from the date the city manager or his/her designee files the written decision with the city clerk to satisfy the requirements of section 5.46(3); otherwise the alarm user's permit for the premises shall become automatically revoked. 
(4)  If the city manager or his/her designee determines that the alarm was activated by lightning, the false alarm report shall be cancelled. However, within 15 calendar days from the date the city manager or his/her designee files the written decision with the city clerk, the alarm user must present the police department written evidence from an alarm company licensed by the city certifying that the alarm system is operating properly, otherwise the alarm user's permit for the premises shall become automatically revoked.

(2)  An alarm permit may be acquired from the Clearwater Police Department upon application. The alarm permit will remain valid until the permit is revoked or until the alarm user changes his or her address or disconnects the system. The alarm user shall be responsible for notifying the Clearwater Police Department if any information contained on the initial application changes. 
(3)  An alarm user that purchases a business or residence having an existing alarm system shall obtain a new permit for the premises. An alarm user that fails to comply with this subsection shall be deemed to be operating an alarm system without a valid permit in violation of subsection (1). 
(4)  If an alarm user has one or more security alarm systems protecting two or more separate structures having different addresses, a separate permit shall be required for each structure. An alarm user who violates this subsection shall be deemed to have committed a Class IV offense punishable by a fine not exceeding $500.00 for each day the alarm system is operated without a valid alarm permit. 
(Code 1980, § 94.08; Ord. No. 5333-93, § 1, 2-4-93; Ord. No. 6638-01, § 2, 2-1-01) 
Sec. 5.62. - Application.

For business alarm users, the application shall also include the name of an individual employed at the premises who will represent the business as its agent to receive service of any notice required by this article.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 12.01. - Policy and finding. 
(1)  Basic to good community relations in the city is the God-given dignity and worth of humanity. Our heritage has provided the moral, ethical and spiritual foundation upon which civilization is built. Moral and spiritual values intertwined with secular concerns, can unite the ability of all citizens to achieve the good life, based on universal justice and full opportunity. The city commission therefore affirms the necessity of good community relations between all groups in the city, in order to gain continuous growth in the development of a just, righteous and compassionate society. The city commission further affirms that in the city, with its population consisting of people of both sexes, married and unmarried, the physically and mentally impaired and people of every race, age, color, creed, national origin, and ancestry, as well as people of differing education, social and economic stations, there is no greater danger to health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of these differences. The city commission hereby finds and declares that acts of prejudice, intolerance, discrimination and disorder occasioned thereby threaten the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundations of a free democratic state. A community relations board is found necessary and desirable to encourage and bring about mutual understanding; to assist the efforts of citizens and groups who are striving to eliminate prejudice, privation, intolerance, bigotry, discrimination and disorder occasioned thereby; and to give effect to the guarantee of equal rights for all ensured by the constitution and the laws of Florida and of the United States of America. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to preserve the public safety, health and general welfare and to further the purposes stated in this section.

All health care facilities operating within the city shall honor the registered domestic partnership documentation issued pursuant to this Code as evidence of the partnership and shall allow a registered domestic partner visitation as provided under federal law. A dependent of a registered domestic partner shall have the same visitation rights as a patient's child. 
(b)  Health care decisions. This section pertains to decisions concerning both physical and mental health. Registry as a domestic partner shall be considered to be written direction by each partner designating the other to make health care decisions for their incapacitated partner, and shall authorize each partner to act as the other's healthcare surrogate as provided in F.S. Ch. 765, and otherwise as provided by federal law. Further, no person designated as a health care surrogate shall be denied or otherwise defeated in serving as a health care surrogate based solely upon his or her status as the domestic partner of the partner on whose behalf health care decisions are to be made. Any statutory form, including but not limited to, a living will or health care surrogate designation in the form prescribed by F.S. Ch. 765, that is properly executed after the date of registration which contains conflicting designations shall control over the designations by virtue of the registration. 
(c)  Funeral/burial decisions. Registry as a domestic partner shall be considered to be written direction by the decedent of his or her intention to have his or her domestic partner direct the disposition of the decedent's body for funeral and burial purposes as provided in F.S. Ch. 497, unless the decedent provides conflicting, written inter vivos authorization and directions that are dated after the date of the registration, in which case the later dated authorization and directions shall control. 
(d)  Notification of family members. In any situation providing for mandatory or permissible notification of family members, including but not limited to notification of family members in an emergency, "notification of family" shall include registered domestic partners. 
(e)  Pre-need guardian designation. A person who is a party to a registered domestic partnership, pursuant to section 13.2 above, shall have the same right as any other individual to be designated as a preneed guardian pursuant to F.S. Ch. 744, and to serve in such capacity in the event of his or her domestic partner's incapacity. A domestic partner shall not be denied or otherwise be defeated in serving as the plenary guardian of his or her domestic partner or the partner's property under the provisions of F.S. Ch. 744, to the extent that the incapacitated partner has not executed a valid pre-need guardian designation, based solely upon his or her status as the domestic partner of the incapacitated partner. 
(f)  Participation in education. To the extent allowed by federal and state law, and in a manner consistent with any applicable court orders or valid agreements or contracts, a registered domestic partner shall have the same rights to participate in the education of a dependent of their registered domestic partnership as a biological parent to participate in the education of their child, in all educational facilities located within or under the jurisdiction of the city. However, if a biological parent of a minor dependent, whose parental rights have not been terminated, objects to the participation of a non-biological registered domestic partner in education conferences or other dissemination of educational information, only the participation of the biological parents shall be allowed. 
(Ord. No. 8329-12, § 6, 6-7-12)

(9)  The prosecuting attorney shall present evidence before the board on behalf of the city. 
(10)  All parties shall have an opportunity to present evidence and argument on all issues involved, to conduct cross examination and submit rebuttal evidence, and to be represented by counsel. In addition:

All testimony shall be recorded. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall govern the proceedings. Orders of the board shall be based upon clear and convincing evidence supported by competent and substantial evidence. 
(b)  The board shall consider evidence relating to the comprehensive plan, zoning regulations, and the uses, interim and permanent, that could be made of the property should it become necessary to close the property in order to rid the property of the existing public nuisance conduct. 
(c)  The prosecuting attorney shall have the burden of proving the existence of any unlawful public nuisance conduct by competent and substantial evidence sufficient to meet the clear and convincing standard of proof in any case brought by the prosecuting attorney. 
(d)  If the respondent has been properly noticed in regard to the hearing before the board and if any respondent fails to appear, the board may proceed with a hearing in absentia on the merits of the alleged violation.

(a)  If the board finds that the allegations of the complaint have not been proven, the board shall dismiss the complaint. 
(b)  If the board finds that a sufficient number of the allegations of the complaint have been proven, the board may declare the property to be an unlawful public nuisance. 
(c)  If the board declares that the property is an unlawful public nuisance, the board may then consider the appropriate remedy, at the same meeting or at a later regular meeting or special meeting called for such purpose. The board may, following its consideration of the appropriate remedy, order any one of the following: 
1.  The discontinuance of the nuisance; 
2.  The closing of the place or premises or a portion thereof for any period up to one year in order to rid the place of the public nuisance. Such order shall contain findings as to the type of interim use that could be engaged in on the property and still terminate the public nuisance. A respondent may seek a stay or modification of the order of closure where: 
a.  The respondent can demonstrate that such respondent intends to implement a use other than the one that had furthered the creation of the public nuisance; 
b.  The respondent can demonstrate the implementation of the use will not impede the termination of the public nuisance; 
3.  The prohibition of conduct, operation, or maintenance of any business or activity at the place or premises, and/or business or activity that is conducive to the maintenance of such nuisance. A respondent subject to this remedy may seek a stay or modification of the order of closure where it is demonstrated that the business activity is different from that which created the public nuisance and will not impede termination of the public nuisance; 
4.  The implementation of mitigation strategies that the board deems appropriate and reasonably related to the abatement of the public nuisance conduct; and 
5.  The implementation of any other procedures the board deems appropriate to abate the public nuisance conduct in a particular case. 
(d)  Upon declaring that the property is an unlawful public nuisance, the board may: 
1.  Impose a fine not to exceed $250.00 per day for each day conduct occurred upon which the board based its finding of a public nuisance and a fine not to exceed $500.00 for each subsequent finding of recurring public nuisance conduct occurring on the premises during the time the board retains jurisdiction over the premises. If two or more respondents are fined, the total amount of the fines shall not exceed the maximum amount per day authorized by this subsection. The respondent must satisfy the fine by making payment to the city. Unpaid fines shall accrue interest as provided in section 20.03(3). The board may suspend such fines, in whole or in part, contingent upon a respondent's compliance with other terms or conditions of the order, and may later terminate the suspension and impose such fines upon a showing that the respondent has not complied with such term or condition of the order; 
2.  Award reasonable costs associated with the investigation and hearing on the public nuisance, including an attorney's fee, investigative costs, and costs of recording of its order. The respondent must pay the award of costs and fees to the city. Unpaid costs and fees shall accrue interest as provided in section 20.03(3). The board may suspend such costs and fees, in whole or in part, contingent upon compliance with other terms or conditions of the order, and may later terminate the suspension and impose such costs and fees upon a showing that the respondent has not complied with such term or condition of the order. 
(e)  If the board finds two or more respondents responsible for a public nuisance, those respondents will be jointly and severally responsible for complying with the actions ordered in subsection (11)(c) of this section and for satisfying the fines imposed and costs and fees awarded in subsection (11)(d) of this section. 
(f)  The total fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $15,000.00 during the effective term of any order. If two or more respondents are fined, the total amount of the fines shall not exceed $15,000.00 during the effective term of the order. 
(12)  The findings and orders shall be by motion adopted by a majority of those present and voting. Any motion failing to obtain the required vote shall preclude the issuance of such findings and order. Any order shall require the approval of a majority of the members of the board present and voting, shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall state the action or actions required by or relief granted by the board. Such order shall be reduced to writing, executed by the presiding chair of the board, and filed with the recording secretary of the board. A copy of the executed order shall be mailed or hand delivered to each party within five working days after execution by the presiding chair of the board. 
(13)  The board may retain jurisdiction for one year after the order's effective date to modify the order where just cause is found to exist. 
(14)  The board may request the city to bring a complaint under F.S. § 60.05, seeking an injunction against any nuisance described herein. The board, after ordering any of the remedies authorized by this section, may suspend the remedy and may lift the suspension at any time while the board has jurisdiction whether such remedy was initially imposed or not. The board shall give the owner notice and an opportunity to be heard before lifting a suspended remedy or imposing a new remedy. Lifting a suspended remedy or imposing a new remedy shall not operate to extend the one-year jurisdiction of the board. 
(Ord. No. 8692-15, § 1, 3-19-15) 
Sec. 20.03. - Enforcement of orders. 
(1)  Any order issued by the board under the provisions of section 20.02(11)(c) shall expire one year after its effective date or at such earlier time as is stated in the order. However, any fines imposed or costs and fees awarded under section 20.02(11)(d) shall continue to be an indebtedness owed to the city until satisfied and shall not expire one year after the effective date of the order. Such fines, costs, and fees will become a lien against the property upon the recording of the order as provided in subsection (2) of this section. 
(2)  Any order issued by the board declaring a place or premises to be a public nuisance that imposes fines, costs, or attorney's fees under the provisions of section 20.02(11)(d) shall be recorded in the public records, and shall become a lien against the real property that is the subject of the order. However, where the nuisance abatement action is based on a stolen property nuisance, and is brought against a property owner operating an establishment where multiple tenants, on one site, conduct their own retail business, the property owner shall not be subject to a lien against his or her property or the prohibition of operation provision if the property owner evicts the business declared to be a public nuisance within 90 days after notification by registered mail to the property owner of a second stolen property conviction of the tenant. 
(3)  Fines, costs, or attorney's fees imposed under the provisions of section 20.02(11)(d) shall be due and payable upon the date of the order of the board imposing any and all fines, costs, or attorney's fees. Fines, costs, or attorney's fees may be paid in full without interest during the first 30 calendar days after the date of the order of the board. Thereafter, interest at the rate established by the comptroller of the state pursuant to F.S. §§ 55.03 and 687.01 shall accrue upon any unpaid amount of fine and costs. The interest rate in effect on the date of the order of the board shall remain in effect until the fine and costs are paid. If the board suspends a fine, costs, or both, interest shall begin to accrue 30 calendar days after the date that the board may terminate the suspension and impose the fines or costs, or both, in whole or in part. 
(4)  Any lien recorded against real property may be foreclosed by the city and the owner of such real property shall be liable for all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, associated with the recording of orders and foreclosure. However, no lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property that is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the Florida Constitution. 
(5)  An order issued by the board under the provisions of section 20.02(11)(c) may be enforced pursuant to the procedures contained in F.S. § 120.69. 
(6)  All powers and rights conferred by this article shall be in addition to and supplemental to those conferred by any other general or special laws governing public nuisances and shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purpose of this article. 
(Ord. No. 8692-15, § 1, 3-19-15) 
Sec. 20.04. - Appeals by respondent. 
    An order of the board shall be subject to judicial review in the manner provided by law.

Sec. 27.01. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Assessable area means the area of property that will receive a special benefit from a special assessment improvement. 
    Assessable front footage means the length of property abutting a special assessment improvement that will receive a special benefit from that improvement. 
    Assessable value means the value of real property that will receive a special benefit from a special assessment improvement. For the purposes of this chapter, the value shall be determined by reference to the assessed value according to the latest final assessment roll prepared by the property appraiser for Pinellas County, including improvements but without regard to exemptions. 
    Basis for assessment means the assessable area, assessable front footage, or assessable value of real property deriving a special benefit from a special assessment improvement, as determined by the city commission in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. When appropriate, the city commission may use a basis other than area, front footage, or value in allocating project costs among properties specially benefitted by a special assessment improvement. 
    Cost per assessable unit means the total project cost divided by the total basis for assessment of all specially benefitted properties. 
    Improvement shall mean a valuable addition made to real property or an amelioration in its condition. For the purposes of this chapter, the term shall include but not be limited to repairs and replacement. 
    Special assessment improvement means a public works project which adds to or extends the capability of a municipal service and which specially benefits properties adjoining or adjacent to the project, or located within an area in which the special benefits may be determined, by increasing the safety, utility, accessibility or value of the properties involved. The term includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the construction, reconstruction, repair, paving, repaving, widening, guttering and draining of streets and sidewalks, the construction or reconstruction of sanitary sewers, storm sewers and drains, water mains, water laterals and other water distribution facilities, including the necessary appurtenances thereto; provisions for drainage and reclamation of wet, low or overflowed lands; and bridges and culverts. The term includes any improvement of general benefit to the public which the city commission determines to serve a proper public purpose, and may include improvements conducted jointly with any other public agency or publicly regulated utility. 
    Standard city street means a paved thoroughfare with a minimum width of 30 feet from the back of one curb to the back of the other curb and complete with standard curbs and storm drainage. 
    Street includes but is not limited to a road, highway, boulevard, alley, street or other public thoroughfare. 
    Total project cost means the sum of all expenses chargeable to an improvement, including all costs incurred from project inception to final acceptance. Costs to be included are engineering field, design and overhead costs; contractual costs; direct city labor and material construction costs; general city administrative costs as a fixed percentage of the other total costs; and other necessary or incidental expenses. 
(Code 1980, § 117.01; Ord. No. 5459-93, § 1, 10-7-93) 
Sec. 27.02. - Scope of article. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to special assessment improvements. Such improvements may be made or undertaken whenever the city commission determines that such project should be undertaken and completed and the costs collected, in whole or in part, as a special assessment. 
(Code 1980, § 117.02; Ord. No. 5459-93, § 1, 10-7-93) 
Sec. 27.03. - Declaration of intent; notice. 
(1)  Whenever the city commission or city manager shall decide that a special assessment improvement needs to be accomplished, the commission shall by resolution declare the city's intention to have such work performed, designating the nature of the work; the location of the work; the part or portion of the cost to be paid by special assessment; the manner in which special assessments shall be made; when such assessments are to be paid; and what part, if any, shall be apportioned to be paid from other funds of the city. Such resolution shall also describe the lands on which the special assessment is to be levied and it shall be sufficient to describe such lands as all lots and lands adjoining and contiguous or bounding and abutting upon such improvements or specially benefitted thereby. Such resolution shall also state the estimated total amount of the project cost. 
(2)  Upon adoption of the resolution, the city engineer shall advertise for bids for construction of the project in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and include in such advertisement the resolution number and title, except in cases where the work will be performed pursuant to an agreement with another public agency or a publicly regulated utility agency. 
(Code 1980, § 117.08; Ord. No. 5459-93, § 1, 10-7-93) 
Sec. 27.04. - Setting assessments for special assessment projects. 
(1)  Determining basis for assessment. The public works director shall determine the total assessable front footage, area, value, or other assessable unit for each special assessment improvement and shall prepare a preliminary assessment roll in accordance with the method of assessment set out in the resolution of intent. Such roll shall show the lots and lands to be assessed and, after taking into consideration the limitations contained in subsection (2) of this section, the amount of assessment against each lot or parcel. 
(2)  Determining assessable cost per lot or parcel. The estimated total cost of the project shall be used to develop a cost per assessable unit as defined for the total project. The assessable unit of each lot or parcel shall be multiplied by the cost per assessable unit to arrive at the total assessment for that lot or parcel, within the following limits when the basis for assessment is front footage: 
(a)  For corner lots or parcels, a 50-foot credit will be given for street paving, street resurfacing and sidewalk improvements where the short side of the property is adjacent to an existing improvement of the same type for which the current property owner has already been assessed and the assessment paid. 
(b)  For corner lots or parcels benefitting from a sanitary sewer extension assessment project, the short property side shall be used for determining the front footage basis. 
(c)  For irregular four-sided lots or parcels benefitting from a sanitary sewer extension assessment project, the average of the two shortest sides will be used as the basis for determining assessable front footage. 
(d)  Irregular lots or parcels having more or less than four sides will be considered on a case-by-case basis for sanitary sewer extension assessment projects. Assessable footage will be developed for these properties so that assessments on these properties will be proportional to other properties in the project. 
(3)  Credits. Project costs not assessed to individual lots or parcels because of the credits described in this section will be included in the city's share of the project. 
(Code 1980, § 117.09; Ord. No. 5459-93, § 1, 10-7-93) 
Sec. 27.05. - Levying special assessment. 
(1)  Upon completion of the preliminary assessment roll, the city commission shall by resolution fix a time and place at which the owners of property to be assessed, or any other persons interested therein, may appear before the city commission and be heard with respect to the propriety and advisability of making the improvements and funding them with special assessments, the cost of the project, and the amount to be assessed against each property so improved. The city clerk shall provide written notice of such hearing to each of the property owners whose property is subject to being assessed. Such notice shall be provided by mail not less than ten days in advance of the hearing. In addition, notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given by two publications approximately one week apart in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality; the last publication shall appear not less than one week prior to the hearing date. The resolution shall contain the date, time and place of the hearing, describe the area to be improved, and advise persons interested that the description of individual properties to be assessed and the amount of the assessment can be ascertained at the office of the city engineer. 
(2)  At such meeting, the city commission shall consider all objections relating to the assessments and shall make a final decision on whether to levy the special assessments. Thereafter, if the decision is to levy the special assessments, the city commission shall equalize or adjust such assessments where justice and right so dictate, and shall approve and confirm assessment roll by resolution. When so equalized and approved, a final assessment roll shall be filed in the office of the city clerk of the city, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid. 
(3)  A statement of the confirmed assessment shall be provided to each property owner listed on the roll. The property owner shall have 30 days or such other time as may be provided in the resolution adopting the confirmed final assessment roll within which to pay the total assessment. 
(4)  Upon completion of the improvement, the city commission shall credit to each of the assessments the difference in the assessment as originally made, approved, and confirmed, and the proportionate part of the actual cost of the improvement to be paid by special assessments as finally determined upon completion of the improvement; provided, however, that the final assessments shall not exceed the amount originally assessed. 
(Code 1980, §§ 117.10, 117.11(a); Ord. No. 5459-93, § 1, 10-7-93) 
Sec. 27.06. - Certificate of indebtedness. 
(1)  Issued for failure to pay assessment. Where assessments are not paid within the time provided, a certificate of indebtedness shall be issued for each assessed lot or parcel. The certificate shall contain a description of the lot or parcel, the amount of the assessment, a description of the improvement, and shall identify the confirming resolution under which the assessment was made. Such certificate shall be recorded in the public records of Pinellas County and shall constitute a lien coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and other municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid, and shall bear interest at a rate to be set forth in the confirming resolution, such rate not to exceed the maximum permitted by section 170.09, Florida Statutes, from the date of completion and acceptance of such improvement. 
(2)  Installment payments. The certificate, subject to the interest provided in this section, may be satisfied through weekly, monthly or annual installments with such installment payment period to run not more than twenty years from the date of issuance. Such certificate, together with interest, may be paid in full at any time and the property owner shall not incur any penalty for prepayment. 
(3)  Enforcement of payment. Upon failure of the property owner to pay any installment due, any part thereof, or any interest, then the city commission may cause the necessary proceedings to be brought to enforce payment of such certificate, together with all accrued interest. As a part of such proceeding, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs and a reasonable attorney's fee. Default in the payment of any installment of the assessment or accrued interest shall result in the entire assessment plus interest becoming immediately due. Such foreclosure proceeding shall be instituted and prosecuted under ch. 173, Florida Statutes. 
(4)  Validity. In no event shall the amount or validity of the lien or certificate of indebtedness as provided for by this chapter be questioned in any direct or collateral proceeding instituted more than six months after the issuance of such certificate of indebtedness by the city.

Sec. 27.08. - Concurrency of improvements. 
    Before paving or otherwise surfacing or resurfacing any street of the city, the city manager shall determine the time within which sewer, water, gas or other underground utility connection shall be constructed, and shall give notice thereof to the person required to make the connection. If any person fails to make connection when so required, no permission to make such connection shall thereafter be granted after the completion of any street improvement for a period of five years, unless for special reasons approved by the director of public works. During that period of time, no permits to open or cut the street or alley shall be issued without such special approval. Required connections during this period shall be accomplished so as to leave the street improvement unaffected, using such construction methods as jack and bore. Connections made shall be subject to the general provisions of this chapter if they otherwise meet the definitions and intent of the policy on special assessment improvements.

(2)  Conditions for improving streets; street paving. All unpaved or substandard streets that are paved or rebuilt or otherwise improved must be constructed to city standards and specifications to include curbs and drainage. The cost of paving unpaved streets will be assessed to and shared between abutting property owners. If an existing paved street does not have curbs and drainage, the cost of bringing that street up to standard will be equitably shared between the city and abutting property owners on either side of the street, as determined by the city commission. If an existing paved street requires widening, whether it has curbs and drainage or not, the cost of standardizing the street will be shared equitably between the city and abutting property owners, as determined by the city commission. Where a short cul-de-sac or where existing right-of-way is too narrow for street widening purposes, the city manager is authorized to waive the assessment.

If the utility resubmits a plan for restoration correcting the defects, the public services department shall approve the plan, unless the city has inappropriately applied its requirements. 
(21)  If any utility finds it necessary to trim or remove trees or greenery in the rights-of-way or on public land in order to avoid contact between wires or cables and branches, the utility shall notify the Urban Forestry Division at least 48 hours prior to the proposed trimming. At the option of the city, the greenery may be trimmed either by the city at the expense and under the supervision of the utility or by the utility under the supervision of the city. When authorized, trimming of greenery shall be limited to the area required for clear cable passage and shall not include major structural branches which materially alter the appearance and natural growth habits of the tree. Any greenery may not be trimmed in a manner that would be in violation of Article 3 of the Clearwater Community Development Code.

The utility which caused the damage or its authorized agent shall, at its own expense and in a manner approved by the city, replace and restore such places to the same condition which existed before said work was commenced within a reasonable time period acceptable to the city staff. If the owner of the damaged property requests that said owner repair the damage caused by the utility, and repairs the damage in a reasonable time period acceptable to city staff, the utility shall reimburse the owner for the reasonable cost and labor of repairs resulting from the damage. The utility shall further maintain all such restoration in the condition approved by the city for a period of one year following such restoration. If, during construction of a utility's facilities by the utility, a claim arises against the utility and/or the city as a result of the utility's negligent or intentional acts, the utility will hold harmless and defend the city against all claims, pursuant to Chapter 337, F.S.

(2)  The city shall notify all affected utilities in writing at least 60 days prior to construction. The city shall require the utilities to respond within ten days of receipt of the notice, stating the amount of time, in days, the utilities estimate it will require to remove or relocate their facilities. Depending on the scope of the project, the city may grant additional time to the utilities to respond to the notice. 
(3)  If any facilities are removed or relocated pursuant to this paragraph, the utility shall comply with this section, except that the utility will not need to apply for a permit. 
(4)  In-place, out of service utilities remain the responsibility of the utility and are subject to the requirements of this subsection.

(Code 1980, § 44.21; Ord. No. 5267, § 1, 9-17-92; Ord. No. 6288-98, § 4, 6-4-98; Ord. No. 7044-02, § 6, 11-7-02; Ord. No. 8508-13, § 1, 12-19-13) 
Sec. 29.77. - Administrative provisions; rights and remedies. 
(1)  The city may, during the seller's normal business hours at the official location of the seller's books and records, audit the records of any seller of a service that is taxable by the city under § 166.231, F.S. or § 166.232, F.S. for the purpose of ascertaining whether taxable services have been provided or the correctness of any return that has been filed or payment that has been made. Each such seller must provide to the city, upon 60 days' written notice of intent to audit from the city, access to applicable records for such service, except an extension of this 60-day period will be granted if reasonably requested by the seller. The seller may at its option waive the 60-day notice requirement. If either the city or the seller requires an additional extension, it must give notice to the other no less than 30 days before the existing extension expires, except in cases of bona fide emergency or waiver of the notice requirement by the other party. In an audit, the seller is liable only for its taxable accounts collected which correspond to the information provided to it by the city under § 166.233(3), F.S. As used in this section, "applicable records" means records kept in the ordinary course of business which establish the collection and remittance of taxes due. Such applicable records may be provided to the city on an electronic medium if agreed to by the seller and the city. No fee or any portion of a fee for audits conducted on behalf of the city shall be based upon the amount assessed or collected as a result of the audit, and no determination based upon an audit conducted in violation of this prohibition shall be valid. 
(2)  Each seller of services that are taxable under § 166.231, F.S. or § 166.232, F.S. shall preserve applicable records relating to such taxes until the expiration of the time within which the city may make an assessment with respect to that tax; however, a seller is not required to retain duplicative or redundant records. 
(3)  Before auditing a seller under subsection (1), the city shall, upon request of the seller, discuss with the seller the city's proposed audit methodology. The city shall prepare and furnish to the seller a report of each audit which identifies the nature of any deficiency or overpayment, the amount thereof, and the manner in which the amount was computed. In addition, the city, upon request and no less than 45 days before issuing a determination under subsection (8), shall furnish the seller with all other information or material in possession of the city or its agents which is necessary to supplement the audit findings. 
(4)  (a) The city may issue a proposed assessment of tax levied under § 166.231, F.S. or § 166.232, F.S. within three years after the date the tax was due. However, this limitation is tolled for one year if within the three-year period the municipality issues to the seller a notice of intent to audit. If the audit cannot be completed prior to the expiration of this limitation period as extended by tolling, and such condition is due to the seller's refusal or delay in allowing access to applicable records, the city may make a proposed assessment from an estimate based upon the best information available for the taxable period, unless the seller agrees in writing to extend the limitation period. The city may also make a proposed assessment from such an estimate if, notwithstanding agreed extensions of the limitation period to a date which is three years following issuance of the notice of intent to audit, the seller does not allow access to applicable records prior to such date. 
(b)  A seller may apply to the city for refund of, or may take a credit for, any overpayment of tax or interest or penalty thereon within three years following remittance by the seller, and the city will refund or allow the seller credit for such overpayments as were remitted to the city. However, in the case of an overpayment which the seller has previously refunded or credited to a purchaser in accordance with subsection (6), the limitation period for the seller's refund application or credit shall expire three years following the seller's remittance to the municipality or 60 days following the seller's issuance of the refund or credit to the purchaser, whichever is later. 
(c)  Upon expiration of the periods set forth in this subsection, the city's right to assess tax, interest, or penalty and the seller's right to apply for a refund or credit expire and are barred, unless fraud has occurred; however, sellers and the city may enter into agreements to extend these periods. 
(5)  Notwithstanding subsection (4), the city shall offset a seller's overpayment of any tax, interest, or penalty revealed by an audit against any deficiency of tax, interest, or penalty which is determined to be due for the same audit period, and such offsets must be reflected in any proposed assessment. If the overpayments by the seller exceed the deficiency, the city will refund to the seller the amount by which the aggregate overpayments exceed the total deficiency. Absent proof to the contrary, the methodology that is employed in computing the amount of a deficiency is presumed to yield an appropriate computation of the amount of any overpayments. As used in subsection (4) and this subsection, "overpayment" to the city means and includes all remittances of public service tax, interest, or penalty which were not due to the city, including amounts properly collected but remitted to an incorrect municipality. 
(6)  Any purchaser of a service may request from a seller a refund of, or credit for, taxes collected from the purchaser upon the ground that the amounts collected were not due to the city. The seller shall issue the refund or allow a credit to the purchaser entitled thereto, if the request is made within three years following collection of the tax from the purchaser. In any event, a seller shall issue a refund or credit to a purchaser within 45 days following the seller's determination of the amount of taxes collected from the purchaser within the preceding three years that were not due to the city. 
(7)  The city is authorized to assess interest and penalties in accordance with this subsection for failure to pay any tax when due or to file any required return, except that no penalty shall be assessed absent willful neglect, willful negligence, or fraud. Interest will be assessed at a maximum rate of one percent per month of the delinquent tax from the date the tax was due until paid. Penalties will be assessed at a maximum rate of five percent per month of the delinquent tax, not to exceed a total penalty of 25 percent, except that in no event will the penalty for failure to file a return be less than $15.00. In the case of a fraudulent return or a willful intent to evade payment of the tax, the seller making such fraudulent return or willfully attempting to evade payment of the tax, shall be liable for a specific penalty of 100 percent of the tax. Interest and penalties shall be computed on the net tax due after application of any overpayments. Interest and penalties shall be computed on the net tax due after application of any overpayments, and are subject to compromise pursuant to subsection (14). 
(8)  Any proposed assessment or finding of amounts due the seller constitutes a determination of the city for purposes of this section. A determination will separately state the amounts of tax, interest, and penalty claimed to be due or to be refunded, will be accompanied by a written narrative explanation of the basis for the city's determinations, will inform the seller of the remedies available to it if it disagrees with any such determination, and will state the consequences of the seller's failure to comply with any demand of the city which is stated in the determination. 
(9)  A seller may file with the city a written protest of any determination within 60 days after the determination is issued. The city will consider the protest and will, within 60 days, issue a written notice of decision to the seller. The seller may petition the city for reconsideration of a notice of decision within 30 days after the issuance of the notice, and, following reconsideration of such a petition, the city will, within 30 days, issue a written notice of reconsideration to the seller. 
(10)  A determination becomes final 60 days after the date of issuance, unless the seller, before the 60-day period expires, has filed a protest or secured a written extension of time within which to file a protest. If the seller has secured a written extension of time and fails to file a protest within the extended time period, the proposed assessment becomes a final assessment at the expiration of the extended filing period. If a protest is timely filed and the seller and the municipality are unable to resolve the disputed issues, the determination becomes final as of the date of issuance of the notice of decision, unless the seller timely files a petition for reconsideration. If a petition for reconsideration is timely filed, the determination becomes final upon issuance of a notice of reconsideration. 
(11)  A notice of decision or a notice of reconsideration must address each issue raised in the protest or petition, must explain the reasoning underlying the conclusions reached, and must advise the seller of the remedies available to it if it disagrees with the city's disposition of the issues. 
(12)  A seller may contest the legality of any determination by filing an action in circuit court within 60 days after the date the determination becomes final. However, in any action filed in circuit court to contest the legality of any tax, penalty, or interest assessed under this section, the plaintiff must pay the city the amount of the tax, penalty, and accrued interest which is not being contested by the seller. Venue lies in Pinellas County where the city is located. The defendant in any such action is the city. 
(13)  A seller's failure to protest a determination under this section administratively or judicially does not waive or impair the seller's right to seek refund of any overpayment within the time allowed under subsection (4). 
(14)  A seller's liability for any tax, interest, or penalty may be settled or compromised by the city upon the grounds of doubt as to liability or doubt as to the collectibility of such tax, interest, or penalty. The city and a seller may enter into a written closing agreement that reflects the terms of any settlement or compromise. When such a closing agreement has been approved on behalf of the city and the seller, it is final, conclusive, and binding on the parties with respect to all matters set forth therein; and, except upon a showing of fraud or misrepresentation of material fact, additional assessment may not be made against the seller for the tax, interest, or penalty specified in the closing agreement for the time period specified in the closing agreement, and the seller may not institute any judicial or administrative proceeding to recover any tax, interest, or penalty paid under the closing agreement. In issuing a determination, the city will include in its notification thereof to the seller the names of the persons authorized to approve compromises and to execute closing agreements. The city may also enter into agreements for scheduling payments of taxes, interest, and penalties, which agreements will recognize both the seller's financial condition and the best interest of the city, if the seller gives accurate, current information and meets all other tax obligations on schedule. 
(15)  All notices of intent to audit, determinations, notices of decisions, and notices of reconsideration issued under this section must be transmitted to the seller by certified mail, return receipt requested, and the date of issuance is the postmark date of the transmittal. All protests and petitions for reconsideration are timely filed if postmarked or received by the city within the time prescribed by this section. If mailed, protests and petitions must be transmitted by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(16)  A seller may pay any contested amount, in whole or in part, at any time, and the payment does not impair any of the seller's remedies as provided in this section. 
(17)  The city will furnish sellers with prompt, accurate responses to questions and to requests for tax assistance. 
(18)  In all matters connected with the administration of the public service tax, sellers have the right: 
(a)  To be represented by counsel or other qualified representatives; 
(b)  To procedural safeguards with respect to the recording of interviews during tax determination processes conducted by the municipality; and 
(c)  To have audits, inspections of records, and interviews conducted at a reasonable time and place. 
(19)  The city may communicate with other municipalities concerning the following: 
(a)  Technical information concerning a seller's tax and accounting system necessary to conduct an accurate and efficient audit of a specific company; however, in no event shall the information include any data relevant to a specific purchaser or account or the seller's tax treatment of specific services; 
(b)  Names and addresses of companies selling taxable services within their respective jurisdictions; and 
(c)  The name of any company issued a refund of taxes and the total amount of taxes refunded to such company. 
(20)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city will not assess or attempt to assess a seller for any costs incurred by or charged to the city in connection with performing an audit of the seller's books and records, including all travel expenses. Any assessment or proposed assessment of such costs shall be void and unenforceable. The city may, however, assess and collect from the seller the reasonable travel expenses incurred by or charged to the city in connection with performing an audit of the seller's books and records if the seller received timely notice requesting access to such books and records in accordance with subsection (1) and the seller failed or refused to allow such access and did not propose an alternative date on which the audit was to commence, or if the seller and the city agreed in writing to an alternative date on which the audit was to commence but the seller then failed or refused to permit reasonable access to its books and records on the alternative date. 
(21)  The provisions of this section, other than subsection (6), shall not apply to the extent that the seller is the city levying the tax under audit or a separate utility authority, board, or commission of such municipality.

When the chief of police or any police officer of the city intends to impound and remove a motor vehicle pursuant to section 30.073 and the owner of the motor vehicle is then present, the chief of police or the police officer shall, before the motor vehicle is removed, provide the owner with a notice in the form prescribed in this section.

(2)  If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a title certificate issued by the state department for highway safety and motor vehicles, the chief of police shall give due notice to the holder of such title certificate by certified mail, return receipt requested, as soon as such motor vehicle has been impounded. The notice to be given the holder of a title certificate shall be identical to and be a copy of the notice given to the owner of such motor vehicle. Should the owner of such motor vehicle fail at the expiration of 30 days to obtain the release of the motor vehicle, then the holder of such title certificate may, upon payment of all storage and towing charges, obtain the release of the motor vehicle. 
(3)  If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is subject to a foreign title instrument, or if the jurisdiction in which title is recorded is not evident from the document establishing ownership, the owner or his authorized agent, before the release of the impounded motor vehicle takes place, shall deposit with the chief of police a cash sum in the amount of towing and storage charges, which sum of money shall be the equivalent of the cost of 30 days' storage charges and whatever towing charges are due.

Sec. 30.076. - Hearing. 
    If the owner of an impounded motor vehicle, or his duly authorized agent, timely requests the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment and also requests a hearing on the impoundment and charges, as provided in this division, the chief of police shall set a date, not more than five days after the date of impoundment, for the hearing. The chief of police shall designate an individual as a hearing officer to conduct the hearing as required by this section. At such hearing, the owner, or his authorized agent, or his attorney, shall be given the opportunity to present, by oral testimony or documentary evidence, his objections to the impoundment of the motor vehicle and the amount of the towing and storage charges and his liability for payment thereof. If the owner or his authorized agent requests a hearing more than five days but not more than 30 days after receipt of a copy of the notice of impoundment, the owner, his authorized agent, or his attorney shall be required to show good cause for the delay in making such request. If good cause for the delay in requesting a hearing cannot be shown, the hearing examiner shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding that the impoundment was proper and the owner is responsible for the payment of towing and storage charges. If the hearing examiner determines that there is good and sufficient cause for the delay he shall proceed to hear the owner's objections and shall render his decision. 
(Code 1980, § 121.23) 
Sec. 30.077. - Findings by hearing examiner. 
    The hearing examiner may find that the impoundment pursuant to this division was proper, he may find that the owner was not liable for any towing or storage charges as a result of the impoundment, he may determine whether and to what extent the city shall bear the expense of the towing and storage charges, or if he finds that the impoundment was proper he shall establish the amount of the towing and storage charges to be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle. The amount of such towing and storage charges shall constitute a lien on such motor vehicle. A copy of such decision shall be furnished to the owner, his authorized agent, or to his attorney and also to the holder of the title certificate of such motor vehicle. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final. 
(Code 1980, § 121.24) 
Sec. 30.078. - Satisfaction of lien; notice of public sale. 
    The holder of a lien against an impounded motor vehicle which lien has not been discharged or paid may enforce such lien in any manner provided by law. Notice of any sale of the impounded motor vehicle to satisfy such lien shall be given in writing to the owner and any other lienholder, if known, by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such certified letter shall contain the date, time and place of such sale to be fixed by the chief of police and he shall conduct such sale in the name of and on behalf of the city. 
(Code 1980, § 121.25) 
Sec. 30.079. - Disposition of proceeds derived from sale. 
    The proceeds of a public sale held pursuant to this division, whether such sale was conducted by the city or by any other person, after payment of the necessary towing and storage charges and any other expenses incident to such sale, shall be deposited with the treasurer of the city, if the owner of the motor vehicle is absent from the sale, and shall be credited to a trust account. The funds deposited in the trust account shall remain in such account subject to the order of the person legally entitled thereto, or if no claim is made for such funds within a period of one year from the date of such sale the funds shall become the property of the city, shall be released from the trust account, and shall be paid into the general fund of the city as miscellaneous revenue. 
(Code 1980, § 121.26) 
Sec. 30.080. - Charges for towing, storage, etc. 
    When any motor vehicle must be transported to a designated public storage location within the city, the standard charges for towing and storage or other services shall be made by the towing firm and by the city to the owner of the motor vehicle directed to be towed by the chief of police.

(1)  Owner. The furnishing of water, gas, wastewater, solid waste, stormwater management or reclaimed water services brings a substantial and valuable benefit to the land and premises. The owner of any premises serviced with such services shall be responsible for all utility charges due against the premises, except to the extent that such charges may be incurred by a tenant of the premises who is the customer according to the utility system account records. The payment of such charges may be a necessary condition to the continuance or inception of utility services to the premises, and failure to pay such charges when billed may constitute grounds to terminate services to those premises. Unpaid charges for water, wastewater, reclaimed water or gas service, or any combination thereof, shall constitute a lien on all premises served until paid, to the extent authorized by F.S. § 159.17, except as limited by F.S. § 180.135. 
(2)  Tenant. A tenant of any premises serviced with water, gas, wastewater, solid waste, stormwater management, or reclaimed water services who is the customer according to the utility system account records shall be responsible for all utility charges incurred at the premises. The indebtedness for unpaid utility charges incurred by a tenant at one premises shall be personal to the tenant, and shall transfer and become cumulative to that person at the next or any succeeding premises occupied by that person and served by the utility system of the city. The amount due or length of time in arrears shall not be affected by relocation of a tenant from one premises to another.

Sec. 32.066. - Accounts due; method of billing; delinquency. 
(1)  All meters shall be read and bills for all charges shall be rendered monthly. Where any meter is defective or any person has prevented the meter from being read, the customer shall pay for that month an amount equal to the average amount charged for the two preceding months. Charges for each service shall be arranged as separate items on all bills. The bill shall be mailed or delivered to the customer according to a regular monthly billing cycle, and shall be due when rendered. It shall be the duty of the customer to inquire of the utility customer service division in the event of nonreceipt of a bill, and the failure to receive a bill shall not constitute a defense for nonpayment. Any bill which remains unpaid on and after 21 days from the date the bill was rendered shall be considered delinquent and service to the customer may be terminated. However, in cases where the premises is rental property and occupied by a person other than the owner, utility service shall be subject to termination 30 days or more after the date the bill was rendered unless the account is paid in full or the customer and the utility customer service manager agree to terms for payment of the delinquent charges and charges for future service. In all cases, payment of the entire delinquent account may be required in order to avoid termination of service, and the billing statement shall include or be accompanied by a notice to that effect. 
(2)  Where it is proposed to terminate utility service to a customer, a notice of delinquency shall first be mailed or hand-delivered to the customer advising that the account is delinquent. Notice of delinquency may be given to the owner of rental property, but a failure to give notice to the owner of rental property shall not bar termination of service to the property. The notice of delinquency may be incorporated in or given with the bill for the account. The notice shall state the amount past due, including any penalty, and shall advise the customer that the service will be terminated not less than nine days from the past due date of the preceding billing statement unless the customer within such time pays such amount, agrees with the utility customer service manager to terms for payment of the delinquent charges and charges for future service, or appeals the decision to terminate the service to the city manager. An appeal to the city manager shall be commenced by the customer's filing a written request with the utility customer service manager within five days of the date the notice was rendered. No agreement for payment of delinquent charges shall operate to forgive or discharge such delinquency until the charges are paid in full, and a breach of such agreement shall give the city the right to terminate service immediately and without further notice to the customer. 
(3)  Complaints relating to bills shall be made before the past due date shown on the bill. Where the customer has not been billed for services rendered, the city shall have the right to back-bill for any such services. 
(4)  Any bill in an amount greater than $3.00 which is not paid within 21 days of the date the bill was rendered may be subject to a monthly penalty of two percent of the unpaid balance or $3.00, whichever is larger. However, such penalty shall not exceed $250.00 per month.

Sec. 32.067. - Proration of charges. 
    Utility system charges for less than a complete billing cycle may be prorated as follows:

(2)  Metered service. For metered service: 
(a)  If the consumption was zero, the monthly minimum fee shall be divided by the number of days in the billing cycle, multiplied by the number of days of service availability. 
(b)  If there was consumption, but less than the monthly minimum consumption, the charge shall be either the charge for actual consumption or a prorated fee determined as in subsection (2)(a) of this section, whichever is greater. 
(c)  If there was consumption equal to or greater than the monthly minimum consumption, the charge shall not be prorated.

(i)  When the city receives a petition requesting wastewater collection service signed by at least 50 percent of the property owners within a given unincorporated geographic area; 
(ii)  When the state division of health shall officially notify the city that a health hazard exists within a given unincorporated area which health hazard shall be determined by a field survey, appropriate tests and inspections by the state division of health. After receiving the petition or the written official report of the state division of health, the city council shall, by resolution, declare its intention to hold a public hearing to determine the need and necessity to construct wastewater collection lines and facilities in the geographic area, and shall provide notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city once a week for at least two weeks, the first publication of the notice to be not less than ten days prior to the hearing provided for in the notice, and in addition, the city shall send written notice to all property owners within the geographic area as determined by the current county tax rolls, at least ten days before the scheduled public hearing. The notices shall require all persons interested to show cause why the wastewater collection lines and facilities should not be constructed and if at the time designated in the notice no objections are filed, or if objections are filed and the objections shall be deemed insufficient by the council, then the council may, by resolution, order the wastewater collection lines and facilities constructed in accordance with plans and specifications therefor to be kept on file in the office of the city clerk. The resolution shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city once a week for two weeks; 
(iii)  When the city initiates a sewer system expansion into non-sewered areas as part of the Unified System Master Plan (Sewer System Expansion Feasibility Study, 2010 Update). Any owner of property located outside the corporate limits of the city shall execute an agreement to annex and any required service contract as a condition of obtaining service. 
(2)  In the case of resident initiated expansion of Health Department directives: After the completion of the construction of the wastewater collection lines and facilities, the city shall assess the actual cost thereof against the property requesting service abutting the lines and facilities, which costs shall be itemized and subject to audit. If the assessments are not paid within 30 days of the making thereof, the city may at any time thereafter issue certificates of indebtedness against the abutting property for such assessments or parts thereof as are unpaid, such certificates to be payable in not less than three months nor more than 20 equal annual installments, or more frequently as may be determined by the city council, and shall bear interest at a rate of return authorized by law until paid, which certificates shall constitute and be a prior lien to all other liens, except the lien for taxes. The certificates shall be processed and administered in accordance with sections 124, 125, 126 and 127 of Laws of Florida 1923, ch. 9710, which shall provide that the method of collecting special improvement assessments on property within wastewater collection project areas shall be the same as that followed on property situated within the corporate limits of the city. 
(3)  In the case of expansion determined by the city as part of its Unified System Master Plan, and in accordance with Florida Statutes Section 381.00655, the city provides for the following requirements: 
    The property owner has options as to when and how to connect to the system. 
(i)  Properties with functioning on-site septic systems will not be required to connect to the system. The city has the right to request inspection of the system to verify a determination that such connection is not required in the public interest due to public health considerations. However if the property connects for service at the time of construction of the system, the city will utilize the assessed impact fee ($900.00 for single-family residence) to offset costs associated with construction by a licensed plumbing contractor to install a sewer lateral between the city cleanout and the house cleanout. Additionally, these funds can be used to offset costs associated with proper abandoning of the septic system. 
(ii)  If during a time period of up to one year after completion of the city expansion project, the property owner that has opted not to connect has a septic system fail, the property owner can apply for and receive an incentive of one-half of the assessed impact fee ($450.00 for single-family residential properties) to offset costs associated with construction by a licensed plumbing contractor to install a sewer lateral between the city cleanout and the house cleanout. Additionally, these funds can be used to offset costs associated with proper abandoning of the septic system. The $450.00 is a maximum value that will be reimbursed to the property owner's utility account upon verification of the documented costs. 
(iii)  After a period of one year from the date of project completion of a city expansion project, those properties that have elected to not connect to the Unified Sewer System will receive notice of a requirement to connect. The property owner will have 90 days to comply with the terms of the notice after which time the property will begin to be billed for the minimum monthly charge for sewer service, even if the connection to the system has not been made. 
(iv)  Only in the case of the notice to connect; and if requested, Financial Hardship Assistance is available to defer costs of impact fees. The request to enter into a payment arrangement would be made to the city with the property owner agreeing to payment terms including principal balance and finance charge(s) that would be in listed and added to the monthly utility bill as described herein section 32.182(2).

(iv)  When operating an approved grease waste vehicle shall wait at least 20 minutes from end of pump out to allow the interceptor waste to separate in the truck tank before returning gray water. 
(h)  In-ground grease waste interceptors shall be pumped at a frequency that maintains a grease and oil layer of less than six inches on top of the grease waste interceptor and a solids layer of less than eight inches on bottom of the grease waste interceptor. The measurement point for determination of the grease and solids layer shall be adjacent to the outlet pipe. 
(i)  Undersink grease waste interceptors shall be monitored by the food service facility at least once per week. Removal of grease waste and sediments is required when operational capacity is reduced to 80 percent or less. This is calculated by the volume of the top (grease) layer added to the volume of the bottom (sediment) layer, the sum of the layers are divided by the total operational volume - [(Top in 3 + Bottom in 3 )/ total operational in 3 ]. 
(j)  The food service facility shall be responsible for opening access covers or manhole covers to the grease waste interceptor for inspection by Clearwater. 
(k)  The grease waste interceptor area and monitoring facilities shall be maintained safe, clear of debris, and accessible at all times for observation, inspection, sample collection and flow measurement of the food service facility's discharge to the wastewater collection system. 
(l)  Manholes shall be maintained at least to finish grade and will be maintained to prevent inflow. 
(m)  Upon discovery of a problem or damaged interceptor, the food service facility manager shall notify the administrator within 72 hours of the discovery. A maintenance response by the food service facility is required within five days. 
(5)  Food service facility identification. 
(a)  It is unlawful for any food service facility that generates grease or produces grease waste to discharge same into Clearwater's wastewater facilities without authorization from the administrator. 
(i)  Authorization shall be given in the form of a grease waste registration certificate. Application for a grease waste registration certificate shall be made to the administrator. If, after examining the information contained in the application, the administrator determines that the proposed food service facility does comply with the provisions of this section, a grease waste registration certificate shall be issued allowing the discharge of grease waste into Clearwater's wastewater collection system. If the administrator denies a food service facility's application for a grease waste registration certificate, the owner of the food service facility may appeal the administrator's decision to the city manager. To ripen the appeal, the owner of the food service facility must submit a written request to the city manager stating the grounds for the appeal. The city manager's determination shall be final. 
(ii)  Each grease waste registration certificate shall be issued for a five years period commencing from the date of the issuance. 
(iii)  The food service facility shall apply for grease waste registration certificate re-issuance a minimum of 60 days prior to the expiration of the food service facility's existing grease waste registration certificate. 
(iv)  The term and conditions of the grease waste registration certificate may be subject to modification by Clearwater during the term of the grease waste registration certificate as limitations or requirements as identified in this section are modified or other just causes exist. 
(v)  The food service facility shall be informed of any proposed changes in the issued grease waste registration certificate at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the changes. Any changes or new conditions in the grease waste registration certificate shall include a reasonable schedule for compliance. 
(vi)  As condition precedent to the granting of a grease waste registration certificate, the recipient under this paragraph shall agree to hold harmless Clearwater and Clearwater's officers and employees from any liabilities arising from the recipient's operations under the grease waste registration certificate.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 6393-99, § 1, adopted Aug. 5, 1999, repealed Div. 2, §§ 32.211-32.224, which pertained to Discharge restrictions and enacted provisions designated as a new Div. 2, §§ 32.211-32.225, to read as herein set out. See the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 32.211. - General provisions. 
(1)  Purpose and policy. This division sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works for the City of Clearwater (the city) and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and the Pretreatment Requirements for Existing and New Sources of Pollution (Florida Administrative Code FAC 62-625). The objectives of this division are: 
(a)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater facility that will interfere with its operation; 
(b)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater facility that will pass through the water reclamation facility, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the publicly owned treatment works; 
(c)  To protect both wastewater facility and personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public; 
(d)  To maximize, promote and continuously improve opportunities to beneficially use reclaimed water and residuals. To protect these resources for future uses, which may not yet be identified, for the maximum beneficial use by the community; 
(e)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the wastewater facility; and 
(f)  To enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the wastewater facility is subject. 
    This division shall apply to all users of the city's wastewater facilities. The division authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits or general permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
(2)  Administration. Except as otherwise provided herein, the public utilities director (director), or his/her appointee, shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this division. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the director may be delegated by the director to the pretreatment coordinator (coordinator) or other city personnel. 
    The pretreatment program shall be based upon the following legal authority and the procedures set forth in this ordinance. These authorities and procedures shall at all times be fully and effectively exercised and implemented. 
    The wastewater facility shall operate pursuant to legal authority enforceable in federal, state or local courts, which authorizes or enables the wastewater facility to apply and to enforce the requirements of sections 307(b) and (c), and 402(b)(8) of the Act, and any regulations implementing those sections. Such authority may be contained in a statute, ordinance, or series of contracts or joint powers agreements which the wastewater facility is authorized to enact, enter into or implement, and which are authorized by state law. At a minimum, this legal authority shall enable the wastewater facility to: 
(a)  Deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the wastewater facility by industrial users where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause the city to violate its NPDES permit; 
(b)  Require compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements by industrial users; 
(c)  Control through permit, order, or similar means, the contribution to the wastewater facility by each industrial user, to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(2)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated into this division. 
(a)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with Chapter 62-625.410(4) FAC. 
(b)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users Chapter 62-625.410(4) FAC. 
(c)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in Chapter 62-625.410(6) FAC. Only those industrial subcategories listed in Chapters 62-625.880(1) FAC will be considered eligible for the combined wastestream formula. 
(d)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in Chapter 62-625.700 FAC that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. The user requesting variance must file a formal request to the city, along with the permit application for a wastewater discharge permit, in accordance with the procedures in section 32.215 of the division. 
(e)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with Chapter 62-625.820 FAC, with approval from the city. 
Industrial user's file must contain documentation of how equivalent limits were determined. 
(f)  Categorical industrial user (CIU) designations and criteria. These designations and the reduction of permitting, sampling and reporting are at the discretion of the public utilities director. Regardless of designation, all CIU shall be tracked and the list of CIU shall be submitted to FDEP as part of the annual report in accordance with 62-625.600(8). 
1.  To qualify as a non-significant categorical industrial user (NSCIU): 
(a)  Never discharge 100 gpd or more of total categorical wastewater discharged (no averaging). 
(b)  Have consistently complied with all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(c)  Never discharge any untreated concentrated wastewater. 
2.  To qualify as a middle tier categorical industrial user designation: 
(a)  Discharge does not exceed 0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of the WWF or 5,000 gallons per day whichever is smallest. 
(b)  Discharge does not exceed 0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the WWF; and 
(c)  Discharge does not exceed the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant for which approved local limits were developed. 
(d)  CIU has not been in significant non-compliance any time in the past two years. 
(e)  Reduced reporting requirements would still result in data that is representative of the conditions occurring at the facility and in the discharge. 
(3)  State pretreatment standards. Chapter 62-625.410 FAC identifies pretreatment standards (by reference) for industries, and is applicable in the determination of categorical industrial discharges within the city's jurisdiction. 
    The industrial pretreatment program shall develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance, and at a minimum enable the program to: 
    Identify and locate all possible industrial users which might be subject to the pretreatment program. 32-214(1). 
(a)  Identify the character and volume of pollutants contributed to the WWF by the industrial users identified under (a) above, 32.214(2); 32.214(6); 32.216(1); 
(b)  Notify industrial users identified under (a) above of applicable pretreatment standards and any applicable requirements under Parts I and IV of Chapter 403, F.S., regarding disposal of sludge. Within 30 days of approval of a list of significant industrial users, in accordance with paragraph 32.214(1)(d), notify each significant industrial user of its status as such and of all requirements applicable to it as a result of such status; 
(c)  Receive and analyze self-monitoring reports and other notices submitted by industrial users in accordance with the self-monitoring requirements in Rule 62-625.600 FAC; 
(d)  Randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing non-compliance with pretreatment standards. Inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year, except as specified in sub-subparagraphs 1. through 3. below. 
1.  Where the control authority has authorized a categorical industrial user to waive sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with paragraph 62-625.600(4)(b), FAC, the control authority must sample for the waived pollutant(s) at least once during the term of the categorical industrial user's control mechanism. In the event that the control authority subsequently determines that a waived pollutant is present or is expected to be present in the industrial user's wastewater based on changes that occur in the user's operations, the control authority must immediately begin at least annual inspection and effluent monitoring of the user's discharge; 
2.  Where the control authority has determined that an industrial user meets the criteria for classification as a non-significant categorical industrial user, the control authority must evaluate, at least once per year, whether an industrial user continues to meet the criteria in paragraph 62-625.200(25)(c), FAC; or 
3.  In the case of industrial users subject to reduced reporting requirements under paragraph 62-625.600(4)(d), FAC, the control authority must randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct inspections at least once every two years. If the industrial user no longer meets the conditions for reduced reporting in paragraph 62-625.600(4)(d), FAC, the control authority must immediately begin sampling and inspecting the industrial user at least once a year; 
(e)  Evaluate significant industrial users plan to control slug discharges 32.213(3). 
(f)  Investigate instances of non-compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements, as indicated in the reports and notices required under Rule 62-625.600, FAC, or indicated by analysis, inspection, and surveillance activities described in subparagraph (d) above. 
(4)  Local limits. Local limits shall be established, using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to FDEP, to protect against pass through and interference. A "plan of study" must be submitted to the department prior to beginning sampling necessary to determine local limits. No industrial user shall discharge process wastewater, individual regulated wastestreams, unregulated wastestreams, or dilute wastestreams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the director, or his/her designee. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each significant industrial user (SIU) permit issued. 
(a)  The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, WWF operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation of the modified limits shall be accomplished through the development and issuance of an addendum to each SIU permit. 
(b)  The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWF. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The coordinator may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations set forth by the director, or his/her designee. 
(c)  The pretreatment program may develop best management practices (BMPs) these may be implemented by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits these BMP's shall be considered local limits and pretreatment standards 32.212(1) and shall be enforced as such. 
(5)  The city's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance, or by the director, individual wastewater discharge permits, or general permits, more stringent standards or requirements for discharges to the WWF consistent with the purpose of this ordinance. 
(6)  Dilution. Dilution prohibited as substitute for treatment. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

9.  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the coordinator to ensure compliance with this division, and state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. 
(4)  Wastewater discharge permit waivers and reduced reporting criteria. 
(a)  The director may authorize the industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to waive sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user demonstrates the following through sampling and other technical factors: 
1.  The pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or the pollutant is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user; 
2.  The pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(b)  This authorization of the monitoring waiver is subject to the following conditions and does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as specified in the categorical pretreatment standard: 
1.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism. 
2.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the department approved method from Rule 62-4.246, FAC, with the lowest method detection limit for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
3.  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with subsection 32.214(7). 
4.  The authorization must be included as a condition in the industrial user's control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
5.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the industrial user's control mechanism by the control authority, the industrial user must certify each report with the following statement 62.625.600(4)(c)5: "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR [specify applicable national pretreatment standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under paragraph 62-625.600(4)(a), FAC." 
6.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present, or is expected to be present, based on changes that occur in the industrial user's operations, the industrial user must immediately notify the control authority and comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (4)(a) above or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control authority 
(c)  Waivers administration: 
1.  Where the control authority has authorized a categorical industrial user to waive sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with paragraph 62-625.600(4)(b), FAC, the control authority must sample for the waived pollutant(s) at least once during the term of the categorical industrial user's control mechanism. 
2.  In the event that the control authority subsequently determines that a waived pollutant is present or is expected to be present in the industrial user's wastewater based on changes that occur in the user's operations, the control authority must immediately begin at least annual inspection and effluent monitoring of the user's discharge. 
(d)  Reduced reporting for categorical industrial user: 
1.  Non-significant categorical industrial user: Where the control authority has determined that an industrial user meets the criteria for classification as a non-significant categorical industrial user, the control authority may decide not to permit the designated NSCIU. The NSCIU shall be evaluate, at least once per year, whether an industrial user continues to meet the criteria in 32.211(4) definitions-significant industrial user (3) and paragraph 62-625.200(25)(c), FAC; 
2.  NSCIU compliance reporting requirements: Facilities shall report annually and submit an annual certification. An industrial user determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user in accordance with paragraph 62-625.200(25)(c), FAC, must annually submit the following certification statement, signed in accordance with the signatory requirements of authorized representative of the user as defined in the definition section 32-211(4). The certification must accompany any alternative report required by the control authority; 
3.  Middle tier categorical industrial user: The control authority may reduce the reporting requirement to no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard(s) or by the director, where the industrial user meets all of the following conditions. 
a.  The industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not: 
i.  Exceed 0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of the WRF, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches; 
ii.  Exceed 0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the WRF; and 
iii.  Exceed 0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were developed for a WWF in accordance with subsection 62-625.400(3), FAC. 
b.  The industrial user has not been in significant non-compliance in the past two years; and 
c.  The industrial user does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
4.  Control authority middle tier CIU compliance requirements: At the director's discretion, the control authority's obligation to inspect and sample middle tier CIU's may be reduced to not less than once every two years. 
(5)  Wastewater discharge permit appeals. The coordinator shall provide public notice of the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including the user, may petition the coordinator to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within ten working days of notice of its issuance. 
(a)  Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. 
(b)  In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the permit. 
(c)  The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal. 
(d)  If the coordinator fails to act within ten working days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a permit, not to issue a permit, or not to modify a permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review. 
(e)  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the Circuit Court of Pinellas County. 
(6)  Wastewater discharge permit modification. The coordinator may modify a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:

3.  Reports submitted at reduced frequency must be representative of the conditions occurring during the entire reporting period consistent with 32.216(1). 
(b)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(c)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in subsection 32.216(11), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(5)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the coordinator of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater, at least 30 calendar days before the change. 
(a)  The coordinator may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 32.214(6). 
(b)  The coordinator, at his discretion, may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 32.214(8) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 32.215(4) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(c)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Flow increases of 20 percent or greater; or 
2.  The discharge of any previously unreported pollutant(s). 
(6)  Reports of potential problems. 
(a)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the WWF, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b)  Within five days following such a discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(7)  Reports from unpermitted users. All non-domestic users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide timely and appropriate reports to the coordinator in the format and frequency that the coordinator may require. 
(8)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. 
(a)  The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis within seven days of notifying the coordinator and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the coordinator within 15 days of the collection of the repeat sample. 
(b)  The coordinator may, at his sole discretion, direct sampling and reporting at different frequencies with alternate reporting periods as may be necessary to protect and maintain the WWF effluent quality. 
(c)  The user is not required to resample if the coordinator monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the coordinator samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(9)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. Discharge of hazardous waste shall NOT be allowed. Any hazardous waste that is accidentally discharged shall be reported immediately per subsection 32.216(6). 
(10)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in Chapter 62-160 FAC and Chapter 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If either of the above techniques does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(11)  Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the even flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(c)  Sample taking and analyses shall be performed with sufficient care to produce evidence admissible in enforcement proceedings or in judicial actions; DEP-SOP-001/01 or its successors shall be applied procedures for all samples. 
(12)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(13)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and documentation associated with best management practices established under section 32-212(4)(c). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years beyond the expiration date of the permit for which the records were created. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the coordinator. 
(a)  All sampling and analysis activities shall be subject to the recordkeeping requirements specified in Chapter 62-160 FAC. 
(b)  The control authority must retain documentation to support the control authority's determination that a specific industrial user qualifies for reduced reporting requirements under paragraph (4)(d), above, for a period of three years after the expiration of the term of the permit or control mechanism.

Sec. 32.219. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The coordinator shall comply with the public participation requirements of F.S. Ch. 120, in enforcement of pretreatment standards. In addition, these procedures shall include provision for at least annual public notification of industrial users who were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the previous 12 months. Public notification shall include being published in a newspaper(s) of general circulation within the jurisdiction served by the WWF that meets the requirements of F.S. §§ 50.011 and 50.013 for the purpose of this provision. An industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following: 
(a)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude), a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits; 
(b)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all measurements for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOC, TSS, total oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). 
(c)  Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of the WWF personnel or the general public; 
(d)  Any discharge that has resulted in the control authority's exercise of its emergency authority under 32.220(5) and/or (7) to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(e)  Failure to meet, within 90 days after the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(f)  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(g)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(h)  Any other violation or group of violations including a violation of best management practices, which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the pretreatment program.

Sec. 32.220. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(1)  Notification of violation. When the coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the coordinator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 14 calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(2)  Consent orders. The coordinator may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (4) and (5) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(3)  Show cause hearing. The coordinator may order a user that has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the coordinator and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. 
(a)  Notice shall be formally served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 14 calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. 
(b)  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(4)  Compliance orders. When the coordinator fins that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the coordinator may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. 
(a)  Compliance orders shall include specific action(s) to be taken by the user, a compliance reporting requirement and a milestone schedule for completion of compliance activities and reporting. 
(b)  Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. 
(c)  A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. 
(d)  If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. 
(e)  Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(5)  Cease and desist orders. When the coordinator fins that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the coordinator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(a)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(b)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(6)  Administrative fines. 
(a)  When the coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the coordinator may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $5,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 18 percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 18 percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the coordinator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 14 calendar days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the coordinator may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The coordinator may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(7)  Emergency suspensions. The coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The coordinator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the WWF, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(a)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the coordinator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the WWF, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated tot eh satisfaction of the coordinator that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in 32.220 subsection (8) are initiated against the user. 
(b)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the coordinator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under 32.220 subsections (3) or (8). 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(8)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 32.215(7), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(a)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(b)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(c)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(d)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(e)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 32.212. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under 32.220 subsection (3) why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 6393-99, § 1, 8-5-99; Ord. No. 8322-13, § 10, 2-21-13) 
Sec. 32.221. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. When the coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the coordinator may petition the Circuit Court of Pinellas County through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The coordinator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. 
(a)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a minimum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(b)  The coordinator may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(c)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(d)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(3)  Criminal prosecution. 
(a)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a minimum fine of $1,000.00 per violation, per day, and not more than $10,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 
(b)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a felony of the third degree and be subject to a minimum penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than five years, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(c)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this division, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction, be punished by a minimum fine of $1,000.00 per violation, per day, and not more than $10,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 
(4)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The coordinator may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the coordinator may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the coordinator is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 6393-99, § 1, 8-5-99; Ord. No. 8322-13, § 11, 2-21-13) 
Sec. 32.222. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(1)  Performance bonds. The coordinator may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the coordinator to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(2)  Liability insurance. The coordinator may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the WWF caused by its discharge. 
(3)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(Ord. No. 6393-99, § 1, 8-5-99; Ord. No. 8322-13, § 12, 2-21-13) 
Sec. 32.223. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(1)  Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
1.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
2.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
3.  The user has submitted the following information to the coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
d.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
e.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
f.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(2)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 32.212(1)(a) of this division or the specific prohibitions in sections 32.212(1)(b)3-17 of this division if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(a)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(b)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(3)  Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, 
1.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
2.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to WWF which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Required notification for bypass. 
1.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the coordinator, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
2.  User shall submit oral notice to the coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The coordinator may waiver the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Bypass is prohibited. 
1.  The coordinator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(a)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or sever property damage; 
(b)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(c)  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
2.  The coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the coordinator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)1. of this section. 
(Ord. No. 6393-99, § 1, 8-5-99; Ord. No. 8322-13, § 13, 2-21-13)

Sec. 32.246. - Same-Stormwater utility fund. 
(1)  All stormwater drainage utility fees collected by the city shall be paid into the stormwater utility fund and accounted for separately therein. Such fund shall be used for the purpose of paying the cost of stormwater drainage facilities to be constructed in the various storm drainage basins and paying the cost of operation, monitoring, enforcement, administration and maintenance of the stormwater drainage facilities of the city. To the extent that the stormwater management fees collected are insufficient to construct, operate or maintain needed stormwater drainage facilities, such costs may be paid from such city funds as may be determined by the city commission, but the city commission may order the reimbursement of such funds if additional and sufficient fees are thereafter collected. 
(2)  The fees collected shall not be used for general or other governmental or proprietary purposes of the city, except to pay for the equitable share of the cost of accounting, management, administration and government thereof. Other than as described in this section, the fees and charges shall be used for stormwater management purposes to include but not be limited to paying the cost of planning, design, construction, operation, repair, maintenance, improvement, renewal and replacement of the stormwater management system and monitoring, regulatory enforcement, property acquisition and other costs incidental thereto. 
(Ord. No. 5058, § 1, 12-20-90) 
Sec. 32.247. - Capital contributions. 
(1)  Where the city has constructed or plans to construct stormwater facilities which are proposed to be used by a developer in lieu of a facility which otherwise would be required to be constructed by the developer, the city may accept a capital contribution from the developer and waive certain construction requirements. 
(2)  Appropriate means to assign the developer's capital contributions in the construction of refunding of stormwater systems shall be developed by the city manager. These capital contributions shall take the form of fee-in-lieu-of charges or availability charges. Each situation shall be analyzed by the city manager and a specific written decision shall be developed. The application of each kind of charges is defined as follows: 
(a)  Fee-in-lieu-of charges shall be applied to a site-specific negotiated procedure, wherein a development's stormwater contribution (quantity and quality) shall be assessed its share of the capital needs of the facilities required to serve the development. This capital contribution shall be used for the construction or refunding of city-owned stormwater facilities. The process shall not apply where the stormwater facilities are privately owned. Each application shall be evaluated against the city's stormwater management plan and the cumulative impacts from the development. 
(b)  Availability charges shall be applied on a site-specific basis identical to the fee-in-lieu-of charge procedure, except that the capital investment advanced by the city in implementing a stormwater facility shall be recovered through an availability charge. The capital charge shall be determined on a prorated share of the capacity used by the new applicant as measured by the cumulative impact from the development upon all impacted facilities applied to the present worth of the original capital expenditure. In the case of a developer constructing stormwater management facilities in excess of the site needs, the city may enter an agreement with that developer to rebate fee-in-lieu-of charges paid to the city by other developers over a period of time not exceeding seven years from the date of the agreement.

a.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the lessee shall indemnify and save the city harmless from any mechanic's liens or other claims which may arise from improvements to the premises, and shall require any contractor performing improvements to the premises to furnish a performance and payment bond assuring the completion of the improvements and the payment of subcontractors and material suppliers. 
b.  The minimum insurance, hold-harmless and indemnification requirements shall be in accordance with the latest version of the city's risk management guide. 
(10)  Other provisions. The lease agreement may contain such other provisions as are customary in a commercial lease agreement or which are determined advisable by the city manager, as agreed upon by the parties. The inclusion of certain provisions in this section shall not be deemed to exclude other provisions, not inconsistent with this section, to which the parties may agree. 
(11)  Form of standard lease agreement. The city manager shall develop the form of a standard lease agreement, which shall be used in negotiating the lease of spaces in the marina building. Except for those provisions, which are required by this section, the city charter, or Florida law, the standard lease agreement shall be subject to negotiation in each case.

    Within 30 days after the filing of an application for a waiver from the provisions of section 33.114, the city council at a regularly scheduled meeting shall take action on the application and shall send the owner written notice by regular U.S. mail of the action taken. The waiver shall be granted unless one or more of the following conditions is found to exist: 
(1)  The application is incomplete in a material respect. 
(2)  The application has been fraudulently completed.

Sec. 33.121. - Same-Revocation. 
(1)  Any waiver granted under the provisions of this article shall be revoked by the city manager following notice to the owner or business operator for any of the following reasons: 
(a)  Upon discovery that the application was fraudulently completed. 
(b)  When the city manager finds that any activity conducted under the waiver presents a clear and present danger to members of the public.

It shall be a permissible inference that an activity creates a reasonably likely threat of endangering public safety if customers of an owner or business operator have been issued nine citations within the fiscal year of the city for operating the vessels for which the owner has been granted a waiver in violation of section 33.119 or other city or county ordinance or in violation of any federal or state law. For the purposes of this subsection, only those citations resulting in a finding of guilt by a court of law, or for which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is entered, regardless of whether a violator is formally adjudicated guilty, shall apply. 
(c)  Upon discovery that the owner or business operator has failed to fulfill any one of the obligations imposed on the owner or business operator by section 33.117. 
(d)  When the operation of any vessel permitted to be operated through the corridor results in a death, permanent injury, or significant and permanent scarring or disfigurement to any swimmer within the restricted swimming area or marked corridor. 
(e)  When the owner, business operator or their employees have been issued six citations within the fiscal year of the city for violating any of the provisions of this article or other city or county ordinance or any federal or state law. For the purposes of this subsection, only those citations resulting in a finding of guilt by a court of law, or for which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is entered, regardless of whether a violator is formally adjudicated guilty, shall apply. 
(2)  Prior to a revocation becoming effective, the owner or business operator shall be entitled to be heard by the city commission upon the filing of a request for such hearing, if the request is filed with the city clerk within five business days after receipt of notice of revocation.

(i)  Refund of deposits. The deposit for a residential or community service organization or a registered condominium association account shall be returned after one year of good account experience. For the purpose of this paragraph and for subsection (j) below, "good account experience" means not more than two past-due reminders in any twelve-month period, no disconnection of service for nonpayment, no dishonored checks, no evidence of meter tampering, and no evidence of fraudulent use of the utilities system. 
(j)  Deposit requirement exemption. An applicant for service to a residential or community service organization or a registered condominium association account shall be exempt from the utility deposit requirement if the applicant presents written verification from a public utility that the applicant has had good account experience during the most recent 12-month period, or the last 12-month period of service by the public utility if occurring within the preceding 24 months. However, if the account should at any time be in arrears, or if the customer should receive more than two past-due reminders in any 12-month period or present a subsequently dishonored check, or in the event of meter tampering or fraudulent use of the utilities system by the customer, the city may require a deposit in the amount required for a new account.

A customer who posts a deposit after October 1, 1992, will receive interest calculated from the deposit date and credited to the account on each October 1 for as long as the city retains the deposit. A customer who terminates service, or whose service is terminated, will receive a pro-rated interest credit to the termination date on the final bill. A customer who qualifies for a deposit refund will receive a pro-rated interest credit to the refund date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest payment or deposit refund in an amount less than $1.00 may be paid in cash but shall not be mailed.

(l)  Propane Bulk-Delivered Gas Emergency Generator or Other Standby Service (Rate LPSB): LP gas service to an account separately established for back-up service, where no other substantial gas service is used for year round purposes. Note: This rate is closed for new residential customer applications and is only applicable for residential customers on LPSB service as of December 31, 2008. 
Annual customer charge\$420.00 
Non-fuel energy charge: 
Per gallon\1.00 
Initial delivery charge. A one-time charge for the number of gallons required to initially fill the LP tank (size as requested by the customer) plus the initial annual customer charge. 
(m)  Effect of Energy Conservation Measures on Usage Classes in (a) and (b) above: Should the customer install a more energy efficient appliance or appliances while a customer of CGS and this causes their usage to drop, such that their Usage Class would change thereby increasing the Annual Customer Charge and/or the Non-Fuel Energy Rate, then the estimated effect of the more efficient appliance on annual usage may be added to the actual annual usage to determine the customer's applicable Usage Class. This is intended to ensure that the customer is not adversely impacted for such energy efficient installation. 
(3)  Other gas charges. The following charges and fees may also be applied to customers of the Clearwater Gas System served under an applicable natural gas or propane (LP) gas service rate: 
(a)  Facilities contract charge (rider FCC): A rider applicable to any of the above rates to cover installation of facilities beyond those typically provided to other customers of the class or beyond the costs incorporated into the applicable gas rate. 
On-going FCC charges ..... A monthly flat or per unit consumed charge calculated to cover the on-going estimated maintenance costs associated with the special or additional facilities. These charges will be contractual and subject to annual revisions upward based on the CPI index or based on a revised cost calculation at the discretion of the City Manager or designee. Time-limited FCC charges ..... A monthly flat or per unit consumed charge calculated to cover the costs associated with additional facilities as requested by the customer, excess main and service construction costs which do not meet the construction feasibility formula, or appliance/equipment sales costs. Such charges may include other applicable costs associated with furnishing the requested facilities, including financing costs. Where such FCC charges result from the additional costs incurred by Clearwater Gas System at the request of the developer to achieve feasibility, such FCC charges are binding upon the future customers/occupants of such applicable accounts for the period necessary to meet the feasibility calculation for the project. Public fill station facilities charge ..... A natural gas per therm or propane (LP) per gallon charge calculated to recover the common facilities costs to provide such service. This will be calculated and may be updated from time-to-time by the gas system and approved by the City Manager or designee.  
(b)  Purchased gas adjustment (rider PGA): A rider applicable to all natural gas therm rates and propane (LP) gallon rates to recover the cost of the Clearwater Gas System purchased gas supply, including losses and use by gas system facilities/equipment and other applicable expenses. The currently calculated PGA rates for all rate schedules, unless specifically broken out by contract, are: 
Natural gas firm standard rate schedule PGA, per therm\$0.95 
Natural gas interruptible and contract (non-standard) rate schedule PGA, per therm\0.85 
Propane (LP) gas rate schedule PGA: 
Per gallon\2.12 
The above PGA rates are based on the weighted average cost of gas (WACOG) as currently approved for October 2014. These PGA rates will normally be adjusted annually in October and may be adjusted upward or downward from time-to-time with the approval of the City Manager or designee based on actual and projected supply costs and projected consumption levels in order to recover the total cost of the gas system's supply plus all costs attributable to the acquisition of system supply gas and other applicable expenses. The over or under recovery of these PGA costs will be computed monthly and an adjustment in the PGA rate will be made at the discretion of the City Manager or designee. The differential between the Natural Gas firm standard rate schedules PGA and the Natural Gas Interruptible and contract (non-standard) rate schedules PGA will be established and approved by the City Manager or designee for each annual period based on the available records for the most recent 12 months. This differential will typically be computed by dividing the transmission pipeline "reservation charges" component of the WACOG by the therms sold to all of the natural gas firm rate schedules. The gas system may also segment specific gas purchases for specific targeted customer(s) based on contract. Additionally, a fixed monthly amount may be added to the customer charge of applicable classes of natural gas service rates to recover the estimated impact of the added costs associated with gas purchased through a third-party transporter (including generally east of the Suncoast Parkway in Pasco County). These added monthly customer charges shall be credited to the overall PGA recovery account and will be initially set at: 
Residential, per month\$8.00 
Small General Service & Multi-Family, per month\15.00 
Medium General Service & Multi-Family, per month\30.00 
Large General Service & Multi-Family, per month\65.00 
Interruptible Service, per month\150.00 
Contract Rates-Apply the same as the normal class of customer using the above schedules based on usage level 
Similarly, a differential between LP Gas standard rates and contract LP rates may be computed to exclude a portion of the other costs attributed to LP PGA other than physical gas. This differential will be calculated by the Gas System Managing Director annually based on historical costs and will be approved by the City Manager or designee. The gas system may also segment specific LP gas purchases for specific targeted customer(s) based on contract. 
These added monthly customer charges may be adjusted upward or downward from time-to-time with the approval of the City Manager or designee based on actual and projected added PGA costs. 
(c)  Energy conservation adjustment (rider ECA): A rider applicable to all firm standard (non-contract) natural gas therm rates and non-contract propane (LP) gallon rates to recover the cost of energy conservation programs undertaken by the Clearwater Gas System as approved by the Gas System Managing Director. The ECA will not be applied to interruptible natural gas or other non-standard contract rates, except for that portion of ECA, which is collected as a part of the PGA, which may be up to one-half of the annual average ECA billing rate. The currently calculated ECA rates are: 
Natural Gas Rate Schedule ECA, per therm\$0.14 
Propane (LP) Gas Rate Schedule ECA: 
Per gallon\0.14 
The above ECA rates are as currently approved for October 2014. These ECA rates will normally be reviewed annually in October and may be adjusted upward or downward from time-to-time with the approval of the City Manager or designee based on actual and projected energy conservation program costs and projected consumption levels in order to recover the total cost of applicable gas system programs, including energy conservation incentive payments as well as the applicable labor and other costs attributable to such energy conservation programs and other applicable expenses. The over or under recovery of these ECA costs will be computed and an adjustment in the ECA rate will be made at the discretion of the City Manager or designee. 
(d)  Regulatory imposition adjustment (rider RIA): A rider applicable to all firm standard (non-contract) natural gas therm rates and non-contract propane (LP) gallon rates to recover the cost of environmental, operator qualification, distribution integrity, inspection, survey, and other regulatory imposed program requirements imposed on the Clearwater Gas System by federal, state or local regulatory agencies. The RIA will not be applied to interruptible natural gas or other non-standard contract rates. The currently calculated RIA rates are: 
Natural Gas Rate Schedule RIA, per therm\$0.12 
Propane (LP) gas rate schedule RIA: 
Per gallon\0.12 
The above RIA rates are as currently approved for October 2014. Note that this RIA rider incorporates the former Environmental Imposition Adjustment (EIA), which covers the environmental project costs as well as the labor and other costs attributable to such environmental projects. This RIA also includes Other Regulatory Adjustment (ORA) charges, such as operator qualification, distribution integrity, required inspections, survey and other regulatory imposed program requirements and regulatory fees imposed on the Clearwater Gas System by federal, state or local regulatory agencies. These RIA rates (EIA + ORA) will normally be reviewed annually in October and may be adjusted upward or downward from time to time to reflect the over or under recovery of these RIA costs at the discretion of the City Manager or designee. 
(e)  Usage and Inflation adjustment (rider UIA): A rider applicable to all standard non-contract natural gas therm rates and standard non-contract propane (LP) gallon rates to recover loss of planned base non-fuel revenues to the Clearwater Gas System due to changes in use per customer from the test year values as set in the 2014 Gas Rate Study (see below) as well as the change in inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index for U. S. City average of all urban consumers (CPI-U). The currently calculated UIA rates are: 
Natural gas rate schedule UIA, per therm: 
for Residential\$0.00 
for Commercial\0.00 
Propane (LP) gas rate schedule UIA, per gallon: 
for Residential\$0.00 
for Commercial\0.00 
The above UIA rates are as currently approved for October 2014. The UIA rates may be implemented at the sole discretion of the City Manager or designee based on variations from the most recent established Gas Rate Study values: 
CPI-U as prepared by the U. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (basis is September 2014 Gas Rate Study projected index of 239.702) 
Residential Use per customer based on annual therms/natural gas single-family customer. Note that this factor may be applied to all residential standard (non-contract) rate classes for natural gas as well as propane. 
Commercial Use per customer based on annual therms/natural gas standard and contract general service customers excluding Interruptible customers. Note that this factor may be applied to all general service standard (non-contract) rate classes for natural gas as well as propane. 
(f)  Franchise and other city/county fees recovery clause (rate FFR): A charge levied by the Clearwater Gas System on every purchase of gas within a municipality or county area to recover the costs assessed by governmental entities in accordance with the franchise agreement in force between the City of Clearwater and that other governmental entity and including any other otherwise unrecoverable fees, special taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, or other impositions by any governmental entity (including the City of Clearwater) on the services of the Clearwater Gas System sold within such municipality or county area. The fees collected within each governmental jurisdiction shall be used exclusively to pay the franchise fees and other governmental fees, taxes, and other impositions levied on services within that governmental jurisdiction. Within the City of Clearwater where a franchise agreement is not in force, the City of Clearwater will levy a six (6.0) percent payment in lieu of taxes on all gross firm natural gas sales (excluding interruptible) and the Clearwater Gas System will bill this in the same manner as if it were a franchise fee. 
(g)  Tax clause (TAX - Various): All taxes due the appropriate governmental entities (such as but not limited to State of Florida gross receipts tax, State of Florida sales tax, county sales tax, municipal utility tax, and others which may be legally levied from time to time on the purchase of gas) will be billed to the customer receiving such service and rendered to the governmental entity in accordance with the applicable statute, ordinance, or other legally enforceable rule. 
(h)  Other miscellaneous gas charges: The following charges are applicable whenever applicable gas services are rendered the customer:

If the customer provides an approved for service, listed LP gas container, then we will transfer as much LP gas as practical. Full abandonment and/or removal of buried LP tank is at CGS' sole discretion. If the underground tank is removed, then any required landscaping or site restoration is the responsibility of the customer. If the tank is abandoned on-site, CGS will make it safe by removing the gas and filling it with water (water provided by the customer) and the tank ownership then becomes the customer. Tanks will be considered out of service and fuel abandoned by the customer if container is on site more than 12 months without a contract for service or paying entity for the annual customer charge. In such case, CGS will, at its sole discretion, either remove or abandon the tank. 
Other services not normally provided including work on customer property beyond the meter outlet or the outlet of the second stage LP regulator, such as for gas leak surveys, Cathodic protection corrosion control, customer-owned gas line locating; any related repairs to the customer facilities or master-metered gas distribution systems as required by regulation as well as any work required to correct deficiencies or any work required to move facilities-Time and materials

Additional repairs-Time & Materials 
Special seasonal gas turn-on ..... The City Manager or designee is authorized to reduce or eliminate the normal gas turn-on charge to attempt to levelize the workload at the beginning of the heating season.  
Pipeline Damage Claims 
Any person or company who actively engages in excavating, boring, tunneling, horizontal directional drilling, backfilling, digging, removal of above ground structures by mechanical means and other earth moving operations, within the Clearwater Gas System service territory, shall be required to notify the one call notification system 48 hours excluding weekends and holidays before digging commences (References Florida Statutes § 556 and OSHA 1926.651). 
If a person or company causes damage to an above or underground pipeline facilities owned by Clearwater Gas System and through negligence or accident or otherwise has been deemed liable for the damages, then that entity shall be responsible for all costs associated with the damage. This will include the cost of gas lost (billed at the purchased gas adjustment rate), time and materials to repair the damage, all labor cost associated with turning off and on gas accounts that were affected as a result of the damage, and any third party claims plus administrative costs. The party or parties responsible shall remit payment for all claims directly to Clearwater Gas System upon receipt of invoice or notification of the City of Clearwater Risk Management Department. 
(4)  Gas contract and rate application policies: The following represent policies of the City of Clearwater as applied by the Clearwater Gas System: 
(a)  Uniformity of rate and service application: To the extent that the customer requests a review of his/her rate account, all rates, charges and contract provisions are intended to be consistently and uniformly applied to all customers of the same type with the same usage characteristics, fuel options, and equipment capabilities. Any customer who feels that they have been treated unjustly and is unable to resolve the dispute with Clearwater Gas System personnel and management has full access to the normal City of Clearwater utilities dispute resolution process as defined in the City Code of Ordinances, Chapter 32, Section 32.004. 
(b)  Contract rate level determination: It is the policy of Clearwater Gas System to offer a customer or potential customer who currently uses or has access to an alternate energy source and has the capability to use this alternate energy source, or is otherwise deemed to be a threat to discontinue gas usage, a rate level adequate to acquire or preserve the gas load, provided that such a rate application will provide a reasonable profit margin to the Clearwater Gas System and the extension of any capital investment to serve such a customer falls within the normal gas system construction feasibility formula. Where the capability to use such alternative energy source will require an initial additional capital outlay by the customer, the contract rate may be based on a net present value calculation over the expected life of the facility. 
(c)  Rate schedule reductions or minor changes: The City Manager is authorized to reduce the billing charge(s) for any rate schedule(s) or to make minor rate schedule modifications in keeping with achieving the "cost of service based rates" as recommended in the most recent rate study done for the Clearwater Gas System. 
(d)  Main and service extension construction feasibility: Whenever a prospective customer requests a new gas service, the Clearwater Gas System will extend service to the prospective customer under the following conditions: 
1.  Design considerations. The extension of gas service to the perspective customer can be reasonably accomplished within good engineering design, access can be secured though easements or right-of-way, and the service will not jeopardize the quality of gas service to existing customers. 
2.  Main line extension construction feasibility. The maximum capital investment which will be made by the Clearwater Gas System to extend main lines and services to serve a new customer(s) shall be seven times the estimated annual gas revenue to be derived from the facilities less the cost of gas and the cost of monthly meter reading, customer accounting and billing. The formula shall be: 
Non-Fuel Energy Rate × Estimated Annual Therms/Gallons =Estimated Annual Gas Non-Fuel Revenues × 7 Years = 
Maximum Investment for Construction Feasibility 
Note: The Monthly Customer Charge is not included in the above calculation because it is assumed to cover the cost of meter reading, customer accounting and billing. 
3.  Service line extensions. The Clearwater Gas System will install gas service lines off of the main line at no charge to the customer under the following circumstances: 
A year round customer has installed "year round" gas equipment (such as water heating, cooking, heating, clothes drying, and lighting) with an estimated minimum annual consumption of two therms per foot of service line required (Note that "Leisure Living" appliance (such as pool/spa heating, fireplaces, and grills) usage will only be counted at 1/2 of estimated usage and only if combined with a water heater), or 
The cost of such service line extension meets the Maximum investment for Construction Feasibility (as defined "d." above), excluding "Leisure Living" appliances unless a water heater is installed for daily use. 
Customers who do not meet the criteria for service extensions as set forth above will either be charged the estimated construction cost per foot for the excess footage or pay a contribution in aid of construction (CIAC) to cover the deficiency amount from the above construction feasibility formula or enter into a facilities charge contract sufficient to cover this deficiency within a period of seven years. 
4.  Customer contribution required. If the capital construction costs to extend the main exceed the maximum investment for construction feasibility, the developer/customer(s) will be required to either provide a non-reimbursable CIAC to cover the excess investment amount or satisfy this deficiency by entering into a facilities charge contract sufficient to cover this deficiency within a period of seven years. Such facilities contract charges may be reduced or potentially discontinued entirely to the extent that other customer(s) are added beyond the initial customer(s), the facilities covered by the facilities contract charges are used to serve these additional customer(s), and to the extent that there are calculated excess dollars above the additional customer(s) maximum investment for construction feasibility minus the capital construction costs for the mains to serve these additional customer(s). 
5.  Conversion of equipment to natural gas. The Clearwater Gas System will provide the "labor only" to convert the customer's existing appliance orifice(s) (if convertible) to accept natural gas at no labor cost to the customer, provided that the customer's gas use is year round. The customer will be responsible for the cost of all other related conversion parts such as controls, gas valves, gas safety devices, additional piping, appliance venting, provisions for combustion or make-up air, or to correct any code deficiency, or to provide any required engineering evaluation for unlisted or unlabeled appliances plus the cost of gas inspections and related permits. A commercial or industrial customer must enter into an agreement to exclusively use the natural gas service of the Clearwater Gas System for a period to allow for recovery of Clearwater Gas costs; and this amount, when added to the other cost to serve amounts, still renders the project feasible. 
6.  Relocation of gas service facilities. When alterations or additions to structures or improvements on any premise, roadway right-of-way or public easement, which requires the Clearwater Gas System to relocate metering, LP tank, service line, or main line, or when such relocation is requested by the customer, or others, for whatever reason, the customer or others, will be required to reimburse the Clearwater Gas System for all or any part of the costs incurred to accomplish such relocation of gas system facilities to remain code compliant and resolve their potential structure conflict. 
7.  Gas service will be delivered to the customer for each premise at one (1) point of delivery designated by Clearwater Gas System (see City Code of Ordinances, Chapter 32, Section 32.336). CGS highly discourages the installation of multiple meters on the same premise or the use of multiple fuels (natural gas, propane, fuel oil) on such premise. If such installations are justified due to extraordinary circumstances (such as life safety), these must be approved by the Clearwater Gas System Managing Director, and then the multiple meters or fuel sources must be well marked in a permanent fashion. For life safety control purposes, Clearwater Gas will not permit a fuel source (propane or fuel oil) supplied by another company to co-exist on the same premise or commercial occupancy with a Clearwater Gas natural gas service.

PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a publication of the Clearwater Community Development Code of the City of Clearwater, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were Ordinance No. 6348-99, adopted January 21, 1999 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of Ordinance No. 6348-99. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Community Development Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the article. 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Anne Wilson and Janet Cramer, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

(Ord. No. 6526-00, § 1, 6-15-00; Ord. No. 8310-12, § 1, 2-2-12)  
Section 1-104. - Jurisdiction and applicability. 
A.  This Development Code shall govern the development and use of land and structures within the corporate limits of the city. 
B.  No building, structure, water or land shall be used or occupied, and no building, structure, or land shall be developed unless in conformity with all of the provisions of the zoning district in which it is located, all applicable regulations, and all development approvals.  
Section 1-105. - Comprehensive plan. 
The Comprehensive Plan of the City of Clearwater is the official statement of policy of the city in regard to the use of land and all use or development of land undertaken pursuant to this Development Code shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.  
Section 1-106. - Transitional rules. 
A.  Transition period. Where a complete application for development approval is pending on the adoption of this Development Code, the provisions of the regulations in effect when the application was filed shall govern the review and approval of the application for development approval, provided that: 
1.  The application is approved within six (6) months of the date of adoption of this Development Code; and 
2.  Construction begins within six (6) months of the issuance of such approval and is diligently pursued to completion. 
B.  Existing unlawful uses and structures. A structure or use not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Development Code is lawful only if it conforms with all of the requirements of this Development Code. 
C.  Existing approved uses. An existing use which is lawful on the date of adoption of this Development Code, whether permitted as a "permitted use" or a "conditional use" in the zoning district in which it is located, shall not be deemed nonconforming solely because the procedure for approval has changed through the adoption of this Development Code. In the event the use was approved subject to one or more conditions, those conditions shall continue in full force and effect unless a new approval is obtained. If the existing use is nonconforming under either the prior Land Development Code or this Development Code, then such use shall come into conformance with this Development Code if required by the provisions of Article 7. 
D.  Previously granted variances. 
1.  All variances granted subject to a time frame for construction which are still in effect on the adoption of this Development Code shall remain in full force and effect, including any conditions attached thereto, and the recipient of the variance may proceed to develop the property in accordance with the plans previously approved. However, if the recipient of the variance has failed to commence construction before the variance expires, the provisions of this Development Code shall govern and the variance shall have no further force and effect. 
2.  Any variance granted which is not subject to a time frame for construction, where the development proposal to which the variance related has not been commenced prior to the adoption of this Development Code, shall remain in full force and effect, including any conditions attached thereto, and the recipient of the variance may proceed to develop the property in accordance with the plans previously approved. However, if the recipient of the variance fails to commence construction within six (6) months of the adoption of this Development Code, the provisions of this Development Code shall govern and the variance shall have no further force and effect. 
E.  Previously certified site plans. All site plans certified prior to the adoption of this Development Code, and any conditions attached thereto, shall remain in full force and effect, and the recipient of the certified site plan may proceed to develop the property in accordance with the certified site plan previously approved. However, if the recipient of the certified site plan has failed to commence construction before the certified site plan expires or if a certified site plan is abandoned, the provisions of this Development Code shall govern. No site plan certified prior to the adoption of this Development Code shall be extended. 
F.  Previous approvals with required reviews. In the event that an approval granted prior to the adoption of this Development Code includes a condition requiring further review in regard to the development, such further review shall be conducted by the community development board. 
G.  Previous amortization schedules. In the event any use or structure has been subject to an amortization provision under a previously adopted City Code the use or structure shall continue to be subject to those provisions. 
H.  Prior zoning districts. Upon the adoption of this development Code, land which is presently zoned within an existing zoning classification shall be classified within one of the zoning classifications set forth in Article 2 of this Development Code, as follows:

I.  Properties affected by eminent domain. When an eminent domain project has begun and has achieved a substantial amount of progress as evidenced by the condemning authority's adoption of a resolution and/or the approval of final construction plans with greater than 60 percent completion and/or other actions that demonstrate substantial progress prior to the adoption of this Code, the condemning authority or property owner may request that the city review the property under this section. If requested by either the condemning authority or property owner, the city will evaluate the property's compliance with the previous land development code and related regulations and this community development code and develop a post-acquisition-site plan which applies this Code where physically and financially feasible and adequately improves the public safety issues of the site. The community development coordinator may require mitigation and/or improvements to the site that are related to the specific conditions of the site and implement the purposes of this Code. Based on the above criteria, the community development coordinator shall review and approve a site plan which shall govern the re-development of the site after the acquisition by the condemning agency. 
(Ord. No. 6417-99, § 1, 8-19-99; Ord. No. 6526-00, § 1, 6-15-00)  
Section 1-107. - Severability. 
Should any section or provision of this Development Code be declared to be unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of this Development Code as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  
Section 1-108. - Future land use map. 
A.  Countywide consistency. Applications for development approval shall be consistent with the provisions of this Community Development Code and the Countywide Future Land Use Plan as required by state law. Development potential is based on the applicable zoning district and as permitted by the Countywide Future Land Use Plan Designation. In cases where there is a difference between the density permitted in the zoning district and that which is permitted by the land use classification, the more restrictive shall prevail. In addition, uses of land shall be consistent with uses permitted in the assigned zoning district as well as the uses permitted by the Countywide Future Land Use Plan Designation. 
B.  Map adjustments. Plan map boundary adjustments for Water/Drainage Feature, Preservation and Recreation/Open Space categories may be made by the Community Development Coordinator provided that such map adjustments are consistent with a jurisdictional boundary determination under state agency rules which is consistent with such rules; or are consistent with an approved site or project plan for a body of water or drainage feature; or are consistent with the purpose and characteristics of the particular category being adjusted and are based upon a finding of appropriateness by the Community Development Coordinator that such adjustment is de minimis in extent and effect. 
(Ord. No. 8070-09, § 1, 12-3-09)  
Section 1-109. - Zoning atlas. 
A.  The Zoning Atlas of the City of Clearwater consists of a map of the city, published in the form of an atlas or book containing a title and summary page and additional separate sheets, each covering a portion of the city, depicting all real property within the city and designating the various zoning districts and the boundaries thereof. The zoning atlas shall be in sufficient detail so that property owners may locate their properties with respect to the zoning district boundary lines. The zoning atlas shall be available for inspection and examination by members of the public at all reasonable times as any other public record. The zoning atlas is not included herein, but such atlas is on file and available for inspection in the planning department. 
B.  Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the zoning atlas, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  Delineation of boundaries. Zoning district boundaries are shown as heavy lines upon the zoning atlas and are superimposed upon lighter lines designating section lines, fractional section lines, platted lot lines, streets, city limits and other physically identifiable ground features or extensions of same, unless other specific distances in feet or other angles, bearings, radii and other references to a boundary location are specified. 
2.  Boundaries in streets. Zoning district boundary lines when located in streets or other public rights-of-way shall be interpreted as located on the centerline of such rights-of-way. 
3.  Interruption of boundary lines. Boundary lines which are interrupted to show street names or other identification numbers or letters upon the official zoning atlas shall be interpreted as extending through such identifications unless otherwise specified. 
4.  Shore, seawall or bulkhead lines. Zoning district boundary lines shall be construed to follow such shore, seawall or bulkhead lines, and in the event of change in the shore, seawall or bulkhead lines, shall be construed as following the changed shore, seawall or bulkhead line; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
5.  Boundary line unclear. When the exact location of a zoning district boundary line is not clear, its location shall be determined by the community development coordinator using the following criteria in order of importance: the appropriate ordinance as passed by the city commission; the Future Land Use Plan (FLUP) boundary line; and historical development patterns. 
C.  Zoning of annexed properties. Property annexed to the city shall be rezoned through the city ordinances, the zoning classification which most closely relates to the Pinellas County zoning classification, as determined by the community development coordinator, in effect at the time of such annexation and the city zoning atlas referred to in section 1-109. A shall be amended or posted accordingly. 
D.  Consistency. The Zoning Atlas of the City of Clearwater shall be consistent with the City Future Land Use Plan and the provisions of the Countywide Future Land Use Map. 
E.  Adjustments to the zoning atlas. Zoning atlas adjustments may be made by the Community Development Coordinator based upon information demonstrating errors or omissions, or based upon historical data.

a.  Accessory uses must be incidental, subordinate, and customarily accessory to overnight accommodations; 
b.  The following shall apply to required parking for accessory uses: 
i.  Accessory uses located within the building interior may occupy between 15 percent and 20 percent of the gross floor area of the development, but only when additional parking is provided for that portion of the accessory uses which exceeds 15 percent. The required amount of parking shall be calculated by using the minimum off-street parking development standard for the most intensive accessory use(s). Where there is a range of parking standards, the lowest number of spaces allowed shall be used to calculate the additional amount of off-street parking required for the project. In projects where the interior accessory uses exceed 20 percent of the building gross floor area, all interior accessory uses shall be considered additional primary uses for purposes of calculating development potential and parking requirements. 
ii.  Regardless of the gross floor area percentage, overnight accommodations with fewer than 50 rooms that have a full service restaurant shall comply with the parking standards for the restaurant use as contained in Table 2-803. The lowest number of spaces allowed shall be used to calculate the additional amount of off-street parking required for the restaurant; 
c.  In addition to the requirements above, for those projects that request additional rooms from the Hotel Density Reserve established in Beach by Design and whose interior accessory uses are between ten percent and 15 percent of the gross floor area of the proposed building, density shall be calculated as follows: 
i.  Calculate the maximum number of units allowed by the base density; 
ii.  Calculate the maximum number of units that may be allocated from the Hotel Density Reserve established in Beach by Design; 
iii.  Add the figures determined in i. and ii. to determine the total number of units allowed for the site; 
iv.  Divide the total number of units allowed, as calculated in iii., by the total land area to determine the resulting units per acre for the project site; 
v.  Determine the total floor area of all interior accessory uses exceeding ten percent of the gross floor area of the proposed building; 
vi.  Subtract the figure determined in v. from the total land area, and divide this difference by 43,560 to determine the net acreage; 
vii.  Multiply the net acreage derived in vi. by the applicable resulting units per acre figure determined in iv. The resulting product is the maximum number of rooms allowable for the project. 
viii.  The final allocation of rooms from the Hotel Density Reserve shall be determined by multiplying the net acreage determined in vi. by the base density and subtracting this product from the maximum number of rooms allowable for the project as determined in vii. 
d.  Signage for any accessory use shall be subordinate to and incorporated into the primary freestanding signage for the overnight accommodation use. In no case shall more than 25 percent of the sign area be dedicated to the accessory uses; 
e.  Those developments that have obtained additional density from the Destination Resort Density Pool established in Beach by Design are not subject to the requirements set forth in Sections 2-803.I.11.ad.

It is not the intent of this division to restrict or deny access by adults to adult materials or expression protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of adult uses to their intended market, nor shall this division be construed as having such effect. Rather, it is the intent of this division to regulate the secondary effects of adult use establishments upon the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to impose only incidental restrictions on First Amendment freedoms which are no greater than are essential to the furtherance of such intent. 
B.  Legislative findings. The city council finds and declares that: 
1.  The findings set forth in the preamble to Ordinance 5490-93 are incorporated herein by reference. 
2.  The concerns raised in the findings incorporated by reference in subsection 1 raise substantial governmental concerns. 
3.  Adult use establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
4.  Requiring adult use establishments to obtain an adult use permit is an appropriate mechanism to ensure that the adult use establishment is operated in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the residents of the city and the public at large. Among other things, it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the applicant is the actual owner or operator of the adult use establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and the activities occurring therein. Moreover, because a substantial relationship exists between adult use establishments and the commission of sexually related crimes on the premises of those businesses, a substantial justification exists for barring those individuals convicted of certain sexually related crimes from managing adult use establishments until a limited disqualification period has transpired in which those individuals have demonstrated that they are no longer criminally inclined to commit certain sexually related crimes. 
5.  Adult use establishments are a pervasively regulated industry making reasonable inspections and administrative searches necessary to enforce regulatory standards. 
6.  Removing doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting in adult theaters advances the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring at adult theaters. 
7.  The prevention of sexual contact between patrons and employees at adult use establishments is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, but serves to address the concerns raised in the finding contained herein. 
8.  Separating dancers from patrons and prohibiting dancers and patrons from engaging in sexual fondling and caressing in special cabarets would reduce the opportunity for prostitution, and this should deter prostitution and the spread of communicable diseases and infestations. Although a dancer's erotic message may be slightly less effective when viewed from the minimum distance prescribed herein, the ability to engage in the protected expression is not significantly impaired. 
9.  Requiring that the facilities of adult theaters be constructed of materials that may be cleaned easily, that the facilities be cleaned on a regular basis, and that the employees cleaning facilities take reasonable precautions to avoid contact with possible disease-transmitting media is reasonably related to the protection of both employees and patrons from sexually transmitted diseases. 
10.  Requiring operators of adult use establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
11.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult use establishment is substantially related to the significant governmental interest of reducing or eliminating the criminal activity associated with adult use establishments. 
12.  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases and in the investigation of criminal activity to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who either engage in the conduct that this ordinance is designated to prevent or are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
13.  Although the weight of evidence shows that adult bookstores or video stores selling or renting only adult material and having no adult booth/theater component have similar secondary effects as other adult uses, such bookstores or video stores do not promote the transmission of sexual diseases on the premises. Therefore, an exemption for such limited adult establishments from some of the requirements, but not the locational requirements of this ordinance, is appropriate. 
14.  Requiring adult use establishments to locate only in the "IRT" District and on parcels of land with frontage on U.S. 19 that are located in the US 19 DistrictCorridor Subdistrict (US 19-C) and prohibiting adult use establishments from locating within 400 feet of any residentially zoned property, church, school, or public recreation area and within 750 feet of any other adult use establishment located within the City of Clearwater will create a reasonable balance between the constitutionally mandated need to provide a sufficient area for adult uses to locate and the need for protecting public health, safety, and welfare as well as the need to reduce the blighting and downgrading effects that adult uses have on surrounding residential and commercial propertiesparticularly those commercial properties located on State Road 60, which is the main route to Clearwater Beach. 
15.  Requiring adult uses establishments to locate in the US 19 DistrictCorridor Subdistrict (US 19-C) only on parcels of land with frontage on U.S. 19 and prohibiting their location on State Road 60, which is the main route to Clearwater Beach, will provide adult use establishments with commercially desirable locations while contributing to the City's plan to beautify and revitalize State Road 60 so that State Road 60 will provide a more attractive corridor to Clearwater Beach thereby promoting tourism, which is the main economic base. 
C.  Regulation of obscenity subject to state law. It is not the intent of the city commission to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity. These matters are regulated by state law, including Chapter 847, Florida Statutes. 
D.  Regulation of massage establishments subject to state law. It is not the intent of the city commission to legislate with respect to matters of massage establishments. These matters are regulated by the Florida Department of Professional Regulation, Board if [of] Massage, and by state law Chapter 480, Florida Statutes. 
E.  Regulation of public nudity. It is not the intent of the city commission to authorize the issuance of occupational permits and adult use permits to "adult modeling or activity centers," "adult photographic studios," or "special cabarets." The display of "specifies anatomical areas" within such establishments is prohibited by section 21.13, Clearwater Code of Ordinances, and, if such establishment is also an "alcoholic beverage establishment," by section 6.43, Clearwater Code of Ordinances. If the city's prohibition against displaying "specified anatomical areas" within such establishments is declared unconstitutional, then, an "adult modeling or activity center," an "adult photographic studio," and "special cabaret" shall comply with all of the requirements and prohibitions contained within this division.

DIVISION 4. - AIRPORT HAZARD STANDARDS 
 
Section 3-401. - Height limitations. 
The following height limitations are established to prevent the creation of airport obstructions and aviation obstructions which constitute a hazard to air navigation and, subsequently, jeopardize the welfare of those people on the land in proximity to such obstructions: 
A.  Any building, structure, object of natural growth or use of land, which is located on the property within an airport height zone and identified on the Zoning Atlas of the city shall not be permitted a height in excess of the following: 
1.  Within the primary zone. Except for landing and takeoff aids, no building, structure, object or use shall have a height projecting above a plane, i.e, a surface, which is at an elevation equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
2.  Within the horizontal zone. No building, structure, object, or use shall have a height projecting above a plane, i.e., a surface, which is at an elevation of 150 feet over the airport elevation. 
3.  Within the conical zone. No building, structure, object or use located on the inner boundary of the conical zone shall have a height projecting above a plane, i.e., a surface, which is at an elevation of 150 feet over the airport elevation; and no building, structure, object or use located outward from the inner boundary of the conical zone shall have a height projecting above a plane which rises one foot vertically for every 20 feet horizontally that such building, structure, object or use is located from such inner boundary, with the horizontal distance measured perpendicular to the closest point on the inner boundary and the height increase being cumulative to that allowed on the inner boundary. 
4.  Within the approach zone. No building, structure, object or use located on the inner, or nearest runway, boundary line of an approach zone shall have a height projecting above a plane, i.e., a surface, which is at an equal elevation as the nearest point on the runway centerline; and no building, structure, object or use located outward from the inner boundary line of the approach zone shall have a height projecting above a plane which rises one foot vertically for every 20 feet horizontally that such building, structure, object or use is located from such line, with the horizontal distance measured perpendicular to the inner boundary line or inner boundary line extended and the height increase being cumulative to that allowed at the inner boundary line. 
5.  Within the transitional zone. No building, structure, object or use located on the common boundary line of a transitional zone and either the primary zone or an approach zone shall have a height in excess of that specified for the particular location within the respective zone which shares the line; and moving outward from such common boundary line away from the runway, no building, structure, object or use shall have a height projecting above a plane, i.e., a surface, which rises one foot vertically for every seven feet horizontally that such building, structure, object or use is located from the common boundary line, with the horizontal distance measured perpendicular to the runway centerline or extended runway centerline, and height increase being cumulative to that allowed at the point at which the perpendicular projection to the runway intersects with the common boundary line. 
B.  Any building, structure, object or use of land which is not within a designated airport height zone shall not be permitted at a height which creates for aircraft either a minimum obstruction clearance altitude, a minimum descent altitude, a minimum vectoring altitude or a decision height to be raised.

DIVISION 6. - DOCK/MARINA STANDARDS 
 
Section 3-601. - Docks. 
A.  City approval and Pinellas County Water and Navigation Control Authority permit required. No dock may be constructed, added to, or structurally altered without first obtaining approval by the city and a permit from the Pinellas County Water and Navigation Control Authority. 
B.  City approval procedures. Review and approval by the community development coordinator and/or the community development board shall be required prior to the issuance of a permit from the Pinellas County Water Navigation Control Authority. Such approval shall be considered a Level One (minimum standard or flexible standard approval) or a Level Two (flexible development) approval in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 Divisions 3 and 4. 
C.  New docks. 
1.  Docks, boatlifts and service catwalks that serve single-family or two-family dwellings. 
a.  Setbacks. A dock shall be located in the center one-third of the lot or 20 feet from any property line as extended into the water, whichever is less, unless the dock is proposed to be shared by adjoining properties whereupon the dock may be constructed on the common property line provided that all other standards of this division are met. Boatlifts and service catwalks shall be a minimum of ten feet from any property line extended into the water. Tie poles shall be setback a minimum of one foot from any extended property line. Single pile davits and personal watercraft lifts are exempt from these setback requirements provided they are contained entirely within the extended property lines. 
All watercraft must be contained entirely within the extended property lines. 
b.  Length. The length of docks and boatlifts shall not exceed 25 percent of the width of the waterway or half of the width of the property measured at the waterfront property line, whichever is less, up to a maximum of 250 feet. Tie poles may extend beyond the dock, provided such poles do not project into the navigable portion of the waterway by more than an additional 50 feet or 25 percent of such waterway, whichever is less, and do not constitute a navigational hazard. 
c.  Width. The width of docks, excluding boatlifts, shall not exceed 35 percent of the width of the property measured at the waterfront property line or 50 feet, whichever is less. 
d.  Covered boatlifts. Covered boatlifts are permitted provided a permanent and solid roof deck is constructed with material such as asphalt shingles, metal, tile or wood. Canvas and canvas like roof materials are prohibited. Vertical sidewalls are prohibited on any boatlift or dock. 
e.  Number of docks/slips. 
i)  No more than one dock structure shall be located at a single-family or two-family dwelling. 
ii)  In the event that two or more properties each already having a dock are combined, then only one dock may remain. 
iii)  No dock shall provide more than two slips for the mooring of boats, except as houseboats may otherwise be permitted consistent with Chapter 33 of the City's Code of Ordinances. Slips shall be for the exclusive use of the residents of the contiguous upland property. Personal watercraft lifts are not considered to be boat slips. 
f.  Width of catwalks. Service catwalks shall not exceed three feet in width. 
g.  Deviations. 
i)  The community development coordinator may grant deviations from the requirements of this section as a Level One (minimum standard) approval provided that signed and notarized statements of no objection are submitted from adjacent waterfront property owners, as well as signed and notarized statements on the Pinellas County Water and Navigation Control Authority permit application. In the event that such statements cannot be obtained, applications for deviations may be approved by the community development coordinator, provided that the proposed dock will result in no navigational conflicts. Such deviations may be approved through a Level One (flexible standard) approval process based on one of the following: 
(a)  The proposed dock location needs to be adjusted to protect environmentally sensitive areas; or 
(b)  The property configuration or shallow water depth precludes the placement of a dock in compliance with the required dimensional standards; however, the proposed dock will be similar in dimensional characteristics as surrounding dock patterns. 
ii)  No dock shall be allowed to deviate from the length requirements specified in Section 3-601.C.1.b. by more than an additional 50 percent of the allowable length or project into the navigable portion of the waterway by more than 25 percent of such waterway, whichever length is less, except as stipulated in Section 3-601.C.1.g.iii. and iv. below. 
iii)  Deviations for dock length in excess of that which is permitted in Section 3-601.C.1.g.ii. above may be approved through a Level Two (flexible development) approval process only under the following conditions: 
(a)  A dock of lesser length poses a threat to the marine environment, natural resources, wetlands habitats or water quality; and 
(b)  A literal enforcement of the provisions of this section would result in extreme hardship due to the unique nature of the project and the applicant's property; and 
(c)  The deviation sought to be granted is the minimum deviation that will make possible the reasonable use of the applicant's property; and 
(d)  The granting of the requested deviation will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this section and will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental or of adverse effect to the public interest and welfare.

DIVISION 7. - EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 8931-16, § 12, adopted Sept. 1, 2016, changed the title of Div. 7 from "Erosion and Siltation Control" to "Erosion and Sedimentation Control" 
 
Section 3-701. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this division is to achieve effective erosion and sediment control within the city; minimize the impact of land alteration, development, and construction activities on stormwater and surface water systems; maintain the hydrologic balance of watersheds and watercourses; protect the public health, safety and welfare; and conserve wildlife and aquatic habitats.  
Section 3-702. - Minimum criteria and design guidelines. 
The following erosion control standards and procedures shall apply to all development: 
A.  Plan review. All erosion control methods to be employed during construction shall be shown on the final construction plans submitted for approval to the building official. If any land clearing or grubbing is proposed, a permit shall be required pursuant to Article 4, Division 13. 
B.  Stabilization of denuded areas. No disturbed area may be left denuded, and every disturbed area must be covered by mulches such as straw, hay, filter fabric, seed and mulch, sod or other approved material to the extent necessary to cover otherwise denuded areas unless the community development coordinator determines that the circumstances do not require such covering. Within 30 days after the final grade is established on any portion of a project site, that portion of the site shall be provided with established permanent soil stabilization measures according to the original construction plan, whether by impervious surface or landscaping. 
C.  Protection and stabilization of soil stockpiles. Soil stockpiles shall be protected at all times by onsite drainage controls which prevent erosion of the stockpiled material. Control of dust from such stockpiles may be required, depending upon their location and the expected length of time the stockpiles will be present. 
D.  Protection of existing storm sewer systems. During construction, all storm sewer inlets receiving drainage from the project shall be protected by sediment traps, such as but not necessarily limited to synthetic hay bales, sod or stone, which shall be maintained and modified as required by construction progress and which shall be approved by the community development coordinator before installation. In no case shall sediment or debris be allowed to enter a public right-of-way or adjacent properties in such a manner as to create a traffic hazard, a public nuisance or a threat to existing drainage ways. Should the erosion and sedimentation controls shown on the plan be insufficient, it is the responsibility of the contractor to provide controls that perform adequately. 
E.  Sediment trapping measures. Sediment basins and traps, perimeter berms, filter fences, berms, sediment barriers, vegetative buffers and other measures intended to trap sediment or prevent the transport of sediment onto adjacent properties or into storm sewer systems or existing water bodies shall be installed, constructed or, in the case of vegetative buffers, protected from disturbance, as the first step in the land alteration process. Such systems shall be fully operative and inspected by the community development coordinator before any other disturbance of the site begins. Earthen structures, including but not limited to berms, earth filters, dams or dikes, shall be stabilized and protected from drainage damage or erosion within one week of installation. 
F.  Sedimentation basins. Areas of three acres or more shall be required to have temporary sedimentation basins as a positive remedy against downstream siltation, which shall be shown and detailed on construction plans. During development, permanent detention areas may be used in place of sedimentation basins, provided they are maintained to the satisfaction of the community development coordinator. The contractor shall prohibit the discharge of silt through the outfall structure during construction of any detention area and shall clean out the detention area before installing any permanent subdrain pipe. In addition, permanent detention areas shall be totally cleaned out and operating properly at the time of final inspection and at the end of any applicable warranty period. When temporary sedimentation basins are used, they shall be capable at all times of containing at least one cubic foot of sediment for each 100 square feet of area tributary to the basin. Such capacity shall be maintained throughout construction by regular removal of sediment from the basin. 
G.  Working in or crossing waterways or water bodies. Land alteration and construction shall be minimized in all waterways and in a 25-foot-wide strip adjacent to the water, measured from the top of the bank of the waterway. Construction equipment and motor vehicles shall be kept out of waterways and the 25-foot buffer area whenever possible. Barriers shall be used to prevent access by construction equipment and motor vehicles. Where in-channel work cannot be avoided, precautions shall be taken to stabilize the work area during land alteration, development and construction to minimize erosion. If the channel or buffer area is disturbed during land alteration, it shall be stabilized within three calendar days after the in-channel work is completed. Silt curtains or other filter/siltation reduction devices shall be installed on the downstream side of the in-channel activity to alleviate increased turbidity. Wherever stream crossings are required, properly sized temporary culverts shall be provided and shall be removed when construction is completed. Upon completion of construction, the area of the crossing shall be restored to a condition reasonably equal to that which existed prior to the construction activity, or to a condition consistent with what is detailed in the development/building approval. 
H.  Swales, ditches, and channels. All disturbed or constructed swales, ditches and channels leading from the site shall be sodded within three days of excavation. All interior swales and detention areas shall be sodded prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
I.  Trench excavation. The construction of underground facilities shall be accomplished in an expeditious manner, with backfill and restoration lagging no more than 100 feet behind excavation and installation. Where appropriate, excavated materials shall be cast onto the uphill side of any trench and shall not be cast into any channel or channel bank. 
J.  Maintenance. All erosion control devices shall be checked regularly and after each rainfall, and shall be cleaned or repaired as required.

Stormwater facilities required for water quality treatment purposes by the adopted standards and specifications (see section 3-901) but which in the opinion of the city engineer would be impractical because of the size of the property, the space available for such facilities, soil conditions or other site related conditions, may be waived at the request of the applicant upon payment to the city of a fee in lieu thereof, if the property is contained entirely within a designated regional retention district as approved by the city commission. Funds received in this manner shall be used by the city solely for water quality treatment improvements within the established regional retention district in which the property is located. Such fees shall be determined by an established schedule for the specific regional retention district in which the property resides. The schedule will be maintained and updated annually as necessary to take into account the market value of the area of land which would have otherwise been required to accommodate a stormwater treatment facility, according to an appraisal made by the city or by a property appraiser holding either an MAI or SRPA designation, at the opinion of the property owner, and by the construction value of the stormwater treatment facility that would have otherwise been provided, such construction value to be determined by the city engineer.

Section 3-920. - Affordable housing incentives. 
A.  Affordable housing density dwelling units. 
1.  City review and approval process. 
a.  City approval procedures. Such approval shall be considered a Level Two (flexible development) approval in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 Division 4 of the Community Development Code. The use of the density bonus as provided within this section shall not be considered a land use plan amendment. 
b.  Pre-application conference required. Prior to submitting an application for development review of a proposal that includes affordable housing bonus density dwelling units, the applicant shall meet with the city's economic development and housing department director for the purpose of determining that the proposed development meets the definition of "affordable housing unit" and to discuss affordable housing requirements as required by the city's economic development and housing department. The required pre-application conference shall occur no more than six months prior to application for development review. The application for development review shall include a letter from the city's economic development and housing department verifying that the development meets the criteria above. 
2.  Coastal storm area. No affordable housing bonus density projects may be located in the coastal storm area. 
3.  Density bonus. 
a.  Mixed-income affordable housing developments. Mixed-income affordable housing developments contain a maximum of 25 percent affordable housing units, the remainder being market-rate housing units. The percentage of bonus units awarded is based on the percentage of affordable housing units provided, as shown in the table below: 
Percentage 
Affordable 
Housing Dwelling 
Units Provided 	Bonus Density 
Awarded 
15% 	25% 
25% 	50% 
 
_____ 
For example: An applicant has a one-acre site with a future land use classification of Residential Medium (RM) (15 units per acre). The applicant proposes that 25 percent of the units will be affordable housing, therefore the density bonus awarded to the development will be 50 percent. This example is calculated below: 
Maximum Base Number of Units Permitted 	15 

Maximum Number of Units awarded by Density Bonus 	15 × .50 = 7.5 

Maximum Total Number of Units (1) 	15 + 7.5 = 22.5 = 22 

Minimum Number of Reserved Affordable Housing Units(2) 	22.5 × .25 = 5.6=6 
 
(1)  When the determination of the maximum total number of units allowed in the development results in a fractional dwelling unit, the number shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number: this is the allowable density of the development. 
(2)  The number of reserved affordable housing units is based on the total number of units to be built on the site, including those awarded through the bonus. For the purpose of calculating the minimum number of reserved affordable housing units, when the maximum total number of units calculation results in a fraction, the figure shall not be rounded up or down. When the determination of the minimum number of reserved affordable housing units in the development results in a fractional dwelling unit, any fraction less than one-half unit shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number and any fraction of one-half unit or more shall be rounded up. 
b.  Other affordable housing developments. Other affordable housing developments contain more than 25 percent affordable housing units. The percentage of bonus units awarded shall be 20 percent. 
For example: An applicant has a one-acre site with a future land use classification of Residential Medium (RM) (15 units per acre). The applicant proposes that 75 percent of the units will be affordable housing, therefore a 20 percent bonus density is awarded. This example is calculated below: 
Maximum Base Number of Units Permitted 	15 

Maximum Number of Units awarded by Density Bonus (1) 	15 × .20 = 3 

Maximum Total Number of Units 	15 + 3 = 18 
 
(1)  When the calculation results in a fraction, the number shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. 
c.  Standards. In addition to the provisions for attached dwellings set forth in Article II, the following standards shall be met: 
i.  Compatibility criteria. 
a.  The project shall be consistent with existing special area plans, if any. 
b.  Proportionality and scale of the proposed development shall be consistent with the community character of the immediate vicinity of the parcel proposed for development. 
c.  The overall aesthetics of the proposed development shall be compatible with or an improvement to the community character as determined by the community development coordinator. 
d.  The scale and coverage of the proposed development shall be compatible with adjacent properties. If the overall bulk is larger than the surrounding buildings, the bulk may be reduced with the help of design elements such as step backs and setbacks as illustrated below. 
 
Prohibited- In this illustration, a big box building without step
backs is not compatible with surroundings.
 
Permitted- In this illustration, step backs ensure
neighborhood compatibility and reduce bulkiness.
ii.  Design criteria. 
a.  The reserved affordable housing dwelling units shall be mixed with, and not clustered together or segregated in any way from, market-rate units in the development. 
b.  Building materials and finishes of the interior and exterior of the affordable housing dwelling units shall be consistent with market-rate units in the development. 
c.  The architectural features of the buildings and each of the affordable housing dwelling units shall be equivalent to market-rate buildings and units in the development. 
d.  All building façades, including fenestrations, in a development shall have a unified architectural treatment. 
e.  The horizontal plane of a building may continue uninterrupted for no more than 50 linear feet. The vertical plane of a building may continue uninterrupted for no more than ten feet. The vertical plane interruptions may include but are not limited to awnings, arcades, balconies, niches, projections, etc.

Section 3-1204. - Installation and maintenance. 
A.  All required landscaping shall be installed in accordance with an approved landscape plan, including all specified conditions to a particular development approval, and inspected prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. In the event there are any changes to the approved landscape plan, such changes must be reviewed and approved and noted on the plan prior to notification for the final inspection for a certificate of occupancy. 
B.  All landscaped areas must be covered with shrubs, ground cover, turf, three inches of organic mulch or other suitable material which permits percolation. Where mulch is used, it must be protected from washing out of the planting bed. Inorganic mulch, such as gravel or rock, should only be used where washouts occur. Plastic sheets shall not be installed under mulches. 
C.  Trees which are balled and burlapped must have the burlap removed or folded down at the time of planting. All twine or rope must be removed. If wire baskets are used, the upper rows must be cut before planting. If stakes or guy wires are used to support a tree, the wire must be covered with protective material where it is in contact with the tree and the stakes or guy wires must be removed after one year. 
D.  Except as provided for in Section 3-1202, all landscaping required by this division must be protected from vehicular and pedestrian traffic by the installation of curbing and wheel stops, or other protective devices along the perimeter of any landscaping which adjoins vehicular use areas or sidewalks. These protective devices shall have a minimum height of six inches above grade. 
E.  Landscaping shall be installed in a manner which minimizes conflicts between the landscaping and signage and utilities. 
F.  No parking, display of vehicles or outdoor storage or display of merchandise is permitted in or over any required landscaped area, nor are vehicles permitted to overhang any required landscaped area. 
G.  Soil in which required landscaping is to be installed must be generally indigenous to the locale. Soil must be loose, friable and free of limestone and other construction materials, roadbase material, rocks, weeds, grasses, hardpan clay or other debris. pH shall be adjusted where necessary to be compatible with the plant species being installed. Soil shall be slightly swaled to retain surface stormwater. Backfill soil material shall be thoroughly watered in and around plant root balls to prevent any air pockets. The use of amended and enriched soils may be required where necessary to increase the water retention capabilities of soils in order to reduce the amount of watering needed to meet the landscaping's water requirements. 
H.  To minimize traffic hazards, at street or driveway intersections, all landscaping installations must provide unobstructed views in accordance with the sight triangle requirements in Article 3, Division 9. 
I.  The owner and tenant, if any, are jointly and severally responsible for the regular and continuous maintenance and protection of all required landscaping, including the irrigation system, which shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition so as to present a neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse, debris and weeds. 
J.  Required shade trees planted shall not be topped, shaped or severely pruned, but must be allowed to grow to maturity and attain their natural form so that crown development is not inhibited. 
K.  All landscaping near public sidewalks must be maintained to allow unobstructed passage of pedestrians. 
L.  Dead, declining, missing and diseased plant material shall be replaced with healthy material of similar type in keeping with the landscaping requirements at the time of original planting and in accordance with the approved landscape plan. 
M.  Landscaping will be inspected periodically by the City, but not less frequently than every three years to ensure that proper maintenance is provided. 
(Ord. No. 6526-00, § 1, 6-15-00; Ord. No. 6928-02, § 55, 5-2-02; Ord. No. 8931-16, § 16, 9-1-16)  
Section 3-1205. - Tree protection. 
A.  Removal permit - Required. No person may remove or cause to be removed any protected tree or any palm with a ten-foot clear and straight trunk without first having procured a permit as provided in Article 4, Division 12, with the noted exception of all citrus species of trees which do not require a permit for removal. 
B.  Criteria for issuance of a removal permit. 
1.  No permit shall be granted for the removal of a specimen or historic tree. 
2.  In determining whether or not a required removal permit shall be granted, the community development coordinator shall consider the following: 
a.  The condition and location of the protected tree, specimen tree stand, or palm with respect to species, tree structure, competition, disease, insect attack, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interference with utility services. 
b.  Protected trees, specimen tree stands, and palms shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible and reasonable flexibility in the design of permitted uses shall be granted, within the parameters of the zoning district within which the property is located, in order to ensure such preservation. 
c.  Whether protected trees or palms can be successfully relocated on-site in order to accommodate the proposed development. 
d.  If a protected tree or palm must be removed in order to permit an economic use of the property which would otherwise be permitted, the applicant must give the city a reasonable opportunity to relocate the tree to another site in accordance with the provisions of Section 3-1205(C) and replace protected trees on-site in accordance with the provisions of Section 3-1205(D) or pay into the city's tree bank for every protected tree that is removed in accordance with the provisions in Section 3-1205(D). 
3.  Expiration. Tree removal permits shall be valid for a period of six months from the date of issuance. Extensions may be granted by the community development coordinator or designee for good cause. 
C.  Relocation by city or county. The applicant for a tree removal permit may authorize the city to enter upon the property and remove a tree or palm at the city's expense prior to the owner's proposed removal, if in the opinion of the city manager, such tree is of sufficient value to warrant relocation by the city. The city manager, in deciding whether to accept or reject such a donation, shall consider the tree's physical condition, health or other circumstances, such as potential damage to utility lines, that may be anticipated to occur during such relocation as well as the city's need for the proposed donation. Such donated trees will be utilized for landscaping on public lands or as otherwise determined by the city manager. 
D.  Tree and palm requirements and replacements. Tree and palm replacements shall be in compliance with Section 3-1202.B. and the following: 
1.  Attached dwellings and non-residential properties. The total amount of DBH removed from a multi-family or non-residential site shall be replaced on an inch-for-inch basis. 
2.  Single-family detached dwelling and two-family attached dwelling properties. The total amount of DBH removed from single-family detached dwelling or two-family attached dwelling properties (e.g. lot, subdivision) shall be replaced on an inch-for-inch basis, or such deficit shall be met by paying a fee of $48.00 per inch of DBH to the tree bank. However, the number of trees on single-family detached dwelling or two-family attached dwelling properties (e.g. lot, subdivision) shall not be less than as follows unless otherwise determined by the Community Development Coordinator to be unfeasible or physically impossible: 
Required Number of Trees on 
Single-Family and Two-Family Lots 
Lot Size 
(square footage) 	Number of Required Trees 
Less than 5,000 	2 
5,00010,000 	4 
10,00115,000 	6 
Over 15,001 	8 
 
3.  When the community development coordinator determines that there is not sufficient space available to replace the equivalent of all protected trees on-site in accordance with these requirements, the remaining DBH deficit shall be met by paying a fee of $48.00 per inch of DBH to the tree bank. The community development coordinator may determine that certain protected trees are not required to be replaced based on certain criteria, including but not limited to, species, health, hazards, or other conditions. 
4.  Monies paid to the tree bank in this manner shall be used for tree planting projects on public lands within the city and for other urban forestry enhancement projects designated by the city manager. 
5.  Conditions and specifications. 
a.  Characteristics. The replacement trees shall have at least equal shade potential, screening properties and other characteristics comparable to those of the trees for which a removal request has been submitted. The specific locations and design of required replacement trees shall be in accordance with proper urban forestry practices and as approved by the city manager. 
b.  Size. Replacement trees shall be in compliance with the size and quality standards set forth in Section 3-1202.B.1. 
c.  Species. The city may require that the species of the replacement trees be the same as those for which removal is being requested, or may require such replacement trees to be of a species native to the West Central Florida area. Exotic, "naturalized" trees or palms may be used to meet replacement requirements only with the consent of the city manager. 
d.  Native understory plant and enhanced tree protection credit. Native vegetation such as ground cover, shrubs and small trees growing as understory plants to large shade trees are often critical to the survival of a tree that is to remain after development. Therefore, to promote the survival of protected trees after construction, the city manager may reduce the total tree replacement requirements by ten percent if native understory vegetation is allowed to remain within allotted green areas around the subject trees and/or enhanced tree protection methods are utilized such as chain link fence barricades, root aeration systems, cabling and bracing, mulching, fertilization and water during construction activities. The city manager may allow such reduction only upon a determination that the understory vegetation contains valuable native plants that are desirable in an urban environment, and will significantly enhance the subject trees' chance of survival. Native vegetation utilized to meet tree replacement requirements will be noted on an approved site plan by size, species and total area covered. In addition, the native plant material will be maintained in a healthy growing condition, and replaced by comparable plants approved by the city manager should the plants decline. 
e.  Credit for required landscaping. Any landscaping required to be installed by Section 3-1202 or 3-1203 may be used as credit against tree replacement requirements. 
f.  Credit for undeveloped multi-family and commercial property. Twenty-five percent of the DBH of the trees existing on an undeveloped property zoned MHDR, HDR, or any commercially designated property shall be permitted to be removed with no requirements for tree replacements. This removal allowance may be used only one time on any particular site. 
g.  Waiver of replacement trees' specifications. The community development director may waive the characteristics, or species, of the replacement trees only if the applicant for development approval demonstrates to the community development coordinator that such size is not readily available in the market area and that the proposed landscaping treatment with replacement trees is equal to or superior to the landscaping which would have been provided with the larger trees. 
h.  Waiver of replacement requirements for public utilities projects. The community development coordinator may exempt the city from the tree replacement requirements solely for public utilities projects. 
E.  Protective barrier requirements and protection during construction activities. 
1.  A protective barrier shall be place around all protected trees prior to land preparation or construction activities according to the following: 
a.  At or greater than the full dripline of all species of mangroves and sabal palm trees; 
b.  At or greater than the full dripline of all protective native pine trees and other conifer tree species; 
c.  At or greater than two-thirds of the dripline of all other protected species; 
d.  At or greater than the full dripline of trees within a specimen tree stand. 
2.  Protective barriers are to be constructed using no less than two-inch by two-inch lumber of upright posts. Upright posts are to be at least four feet in length with a minimum of one foot anchored in ground and three feet above ground. Upright posts are to be placed at a maximum distance of eight feet apart. Horizontal rails are to be constructed using no less than one inch by four inch lumber and shall be securely attached to the top of the upright post. The community development coordinator must approve any variation from the above requirements. 
3.  Whenever a protective barrier is required, it shall remain in place until all construction activity is terminated. The area within the barrier limits shall remain undisturbed by any activity during construction. Native ground cover and understory vegetation existing within the barriers shall remain throughout construction. Exotic plant species may be removed providing written consent is obtained from the community development coordinator. Plant species removed with the consent of the coordinator may be removed only by manual labor utilizing hand tools or by other approved methods. 
4.  Prior to the erection of any required protective barrier, all surface foreign material, trash or debris shall be removed from the area to be enclosed by the barrier, and after erection of the barrier no such material or litter shall be permitted to remain within the protected area. No equipment, chemicals, soil deposits or construction materials shall be placed within such protective barriers. 
5.  Large areas on a development site, where land preparation and construction activities will not occur, or where heavy machinery will not venture, shall not require protective barriers as otherwise required by Section 3-1205(E)(1) above. Such areas shall be delineated at the point of interface, using a woven fabric ribbon or other materials approved by the community development coordinator. Approved materials shall be attached to two-inch by two-inch upright posts. Upright posts shall be made of wood or other suitable material approved by the community development coordinator, be at least four inches in height and be spaced no more than 50 feet apart. No ropes or ribbons shall be attached to any protected tree. The community development coordinator shall make the final determination as to the location of the protective barrier. 
6.  No signs, building permits, wires or other attachments of any kind shall be attached to any protected tree or palm. Guy wires designed to protect trees are excluded, however, from this prohibition. 
7.  At all times, due care shall be taken to protect the critical root zone of trees protected by this section, and root pruning requirements shall apply to such trees. 
F.  Proper tree care; prohibited tree pruning. 
1.  When construction activities affect protected trees so that the critical root zoned is disturbed, or when pruning must be performed on a tree's crown, adherence to the following arboricultural techniques is required: 
a.  When the critical root zone will be disturbed, affected roots must be severed by clean pruning cuts at the point where construction impacts the roots. Roots can be pruned by utilizing trenching equipment designed for this purpose or by hand digging a trench and pruning roots with a pruning saw, chain saw or other equipment designed for tree pruning. Roots located within the critical root zone that will be impacted by construction must be pruned to a depth of 18 inches below the existing grade or to the depth of disturbance if less than 18 inches from the existing grade. When underground utility lines are to be installed within the critical root zone, the root pruning requirements may be waived if the lines are installed via tunneling or directional boring as opposed to open trenching. 
b.  When pruning lateral branches of protected trees, the proper pruning techniques as described herein, must be followed. Flush cuts (pruning cuts that remove the branch collar) and stub cuts (cuts that leave a stub on the tree) are improper pruning techniques. Any tree that has been improperly pruned will not be recognized as a tree left on the property in a healthy growing condition; and therefore will not be utilized to meet tree replacement requirements. 
2.  It shall be unlawful to remove from a protected tree more than 30 percent of a tree's foliage during a period of one year. 
3.  It shall be unlawful to perform the techniques of topping or other pruning techniques that remove the vertical leader stems of protected trees except to the extent permitted by this section. 
4.  When trees must be topped, such as in instances where there is interference with overhead wires or nearby structures, a tree removal permit shall first be obtained. The community development coordinator will determine if the tree can tolerate the necessary pruning, or if the tree should be removed. The community development coordinator will indicate on the permit that the removal of the tree will be permitted, or will modify the permit to allow the necessary pruning, or may deny the permit. 
5.  When determining whether more than the allowed 30 percent of a tree's crown has been pruned, the community development coordinator shall use the following information to make a decision: 
a.  The quantity and diameter of vertical stems pruned; 
b.  Typical crown characteristics of the affected tree species; 
c.  Aerial photographs or other recent photographs that would indicate the tree's appearance prior to pruning; 
d.  Testimonials from eyewitnesses as to the tree's former appearance; 
e.  Remains of foliage debris on the site. 
6.  Based on the above information, a written report shall be prepared citing all evidence used to support the claim of violation. The violation shall be treated as an illegal tree removal and process accordingly. 
G.  Protection of tree trunks. It shall be unlawful to use tree spikes or other devices that damage tree trunk tissue of protected trees. 
(Ord. No. 6417-99, § 8, 8-19-99; Ord. No. 6526-00, § 1, 6-15-00; Ord. No. 6928-02, §§ 5660, 5-2-02; Ord. No. 7835-07, § 16, 1-17-08; Ord. No. 8349-12, § 32, 9-6-12; Ord. No. 8654-15, § 21, 2-5-15)

B.  Plan considerations. Except as provided in subsection E hereof, in order to secure a building permit to erect a structure on vacant land, remodel an existing structure where such remodeling will exceed by 50 percent the assessed valuation of the property, or add an additional building or structure to land where a building or structure already exists and where the value of such additional building or structure will exceed by 50 percent the assessed valuation of the property, where a sidewalk does not exist, an applicant for development approval shall provide for construction of a sidewalk either in an easement where the property is abutting the public right-of-way, or upon such right-of-way. The building official, when reviewing the building plans and specifications, shall coordinate with the city engineer to insure that the plans meet all city sidewalk construction specifications and provide desirable, convenient and safe pedestrian routes. 
C.  Specifications and construction. The design, materials, width and location of sidewalks shall be in accordance with city standards as established by the city engineer.

2.  The property owner can demonstrate that the subject property would have the only sidewalk within 200 feet of the property on the streets which the property abuts, and that such sidewalk would not form a part of a route leading to a school or public park, and that the absence of a sidewalk would not create an imminent pedestrian hazard by reason of the proximity of the property to motor vehicle traffic. 
3.  If the property owner qualifies for an exception, the property owner shall pay a fee in lieu of constructing the sidewalk to be used to construct a sidewalk at a future date. The fee will consist of the cost of the sidewalk construction which is excepted as indicated in the city's most recent contract for sidewalk construction plus ten percent for handling and record keeping.

Editor's note Ord. No. 8343-12, § 2, adopted August 16, 2012, repealed former Div. 18, §§ 3-18013-1807, which pertained to signs. Section 2(Exh. 1) of said ordinance enacted provisions designated as a new Div. 18, §§ 3-18013-1809, to read as herein set out. See also the Table of Amendments. 
 
Section 3-1801. - General principles. 
The Florida Constitution provides that it is the policy of the state to conserve and protect its scenic beauty, and the regulation of signage for purposes of aesthetics directly serves that policy. Since 1985, the Florida Statutes have required that municipalities enact land development regulations that regulate signage. The city is a resort community on the west coast of the state with more than five miles of beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. This city has an economic base which relies heavily on tourism. In order to preserve the city as a desirable community in which to live, vacation and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive urban environment is of foremost importance. The regulation of signs within the city is a highly contributive means by which to achieve this desired end. These sign regulations are prepared with the intent of enhancing the urban environment and promoting the continued well-being of the city. The enhancement of the visual environment is critical to a community's image and its continued presence as a tourist destination, and the sign control principles set forth herein create a sense of character and ambiance that distinguishes the city as one with a commitment to maintaining and improving an attractive environment. 
(Ord. No. 8343-12, § 2(Exh. 1), 8-16-12; Ord. No. 9029-17, § 2(Exh. A), 7-20-17)  
Section 3-1802. - Purpose.

A.  Enable the identification of places of residence and business. 
B.  Allow for the communication of information necessary for the conduct of commerce. 
C.  Lessen hazardous situations, confusion and visual clutter caused by proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation and excessive height, area and bulk of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
D.  Enhance the attractiveness and economic well-being of the city as a place to live, vacation and conduct business. 
E.  Protect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs. 
F.  Permit signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, and preclude placement of signs in a manner that conceals or obstructs adjacent land uses or signs. 
G.  Encourage signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located and consistent with the category of use to which they pertain. 
H.  Curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business. 
I.  Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains. 
J.  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site or adjoining sites. 
K.  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians. 
L.  Require signs to be constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner. 
M.  Preserve and enhance the natural and scenic characteristics of this waterfront resort community. 
N.  Implement the city's comprehensive plan and comply with the minimum requirements established by state law that requires the regulation of signage.

Section 3-1808. - Comprehensive sign program. 
A.  General principles. 
1.  The intent of the comprehensive sign program is to provide private property owners and businesses with flexibility to develop innovative, creative and effective signage and to improve the aesthetics of the City of Clearwater. 
2.  The minimum sign standards established in this Division 18 ensure that signage will not have an adverse impact on the aesthetics, community character and quality of life of the City of Clearwater. The city recognizes, however, that in many circumstances, there are innovative and creative alternatives to minimum standard signage which are desirable and attractive and will enhance community character and individual property values. 
3.  The purpose of the comprehensive sign program is to provide an alternative to minimum standard signage subject to flexibility criteria which ensure that alternative signage will not have an adverse impact on the aesthetics, community character and quality of life of the City of Clearwater. 
B.  Permitted signage. 
1.  Signage which is proposed as part of a Comprehensive Sign Program may deviate from the minimum sign standards in terms of number of signs per business or parcel of land, maximum area of a sign face per parcel of land and the total area of sign faces per business or parcel of land, subject to compliance with the flexibility criteria set out in Section 3-1808.C. A Comprehensive Sign Program shall be approved pursuant to the provisions set out in Section 4-1008. Prohibited signs in Section 3-1804 are not eligible for a Comprehensive Sign Program. Electronic changeable message signs, back-lit awnings, cabinet signs, and raceway signs are not eligible to be utilized as signs as part of a Comprehensive Sign Program. 
2.  As part of a comprehensive sign program, the community development coordinator shall review all sign types (freestanding, attached, windows, interior site directional, etc.) for the business and/or the development parcel to achieve compliance in so far as possible with these current regulations. A master sign plan for shopping centers, including all out parcels, and office complexes shall include all types of signs for all tenants/uses within the development parcel. The community development coordinator may allow for flexibility in reviewing the master sign plan if it results in a substantially improved and comprehensive proposal. With a master sign plan, the community development coordinator may permit interior site directional signs at a size and location(s) related to the development project, with up to a maximum height of six feet. 
C.  Flexibility criteria. 
1.  Architectural theme. 
a.  The signs proposed in a comprehensive sign program shall be designed as a part of the architectural theme of the principal buildings proposed or developed on the parcel proposed for development and shall be constructed of materials and colors which reflect an integrated architectural vocabulary for the parcel proposed for development; or 
b.  The design, character, location and/or materials of all freestanding and attached signs proposed in a comprehensive sign program shall be demonstrably more attractive than signs otherwise permitted on the parcel proposed for development under the minimum signs standards. All signs must be architecturally integrated into/with the design of the building and/or site using similar and coordinated design features, materials and colors, etc. 
2.  The height of all freestanding signs proposed through the comprehensive sign program shall relate to the design of the sign and shall not exceed 14 feet in height, except in the D and T Districts, the height shall not exceed six feet in height except for signs associated with publicly-owned property and/or public projects which are architecturally and aesthetically integrated into a fence and/or wall. 
3.  Lighting. Any lighting that is internal to the sign letters or graphic elements (e.g., internally lit or back-lit, or that is indirect exterior lighting, e.g., goose neck lighting) proposed as a part of a comprehensive sign program is automatically controlled so that the lighting is turned off at midnight or when the business is closed, whichever is later. 
4.  Height, area, number and location of signs. The height, area, number and location of signs permitted through the comprehensive sign program shall be determined by the community development coordinator based on the following criteria: overall size of site, relationship between the building setback and sign location, frontage, access and visibility to the site, intended traffic circulation pattern, hierarchy of signage, scale and use of the project, consistency with Beach by Design, Clearwater Downtown Redevelopment Plan or any other applicable special area plan and submittal of a master sign plan for the development parcel/project. Additionally, the maximum permitted sign area shall be based on the following formula when evaluated against the above criteria: 
a.  Attached signs. The maximum area permitted for attached signage shall range from one percent up to a maximum of six percent of the building façade to which the sign is to be attached. In no event shall the size of an attached sign exceed 200 square feet. For regional malls, the maximum size of any attached sign that is otherwise allowed shall not exceed six percent of the building façade facing the street, but in no case more than 300 square feet. 
b.  Freestanding signs. The maximum permitted area of all freestanding signs on a site shall not exceed the range of sign area permitted by the street frontage or building façade calculation methods set forth below: 
i.  One square foot per two linear feet of street frontage; or 
ii.  One square foot per 100 square feet of building façade facing street frontage. 
5.  Community character. The signage proposed in a comprehensive sign program shall not have an adverse impact on the community character of the City of Clearwater. 
6.  Property values. The signage proposed in a comprehensive sign program will not have an adverse impact on the value of property in the immediate vicinity of the parcel proposed for development. 
7.  Elimination of unattractive signage. The signage proposed in a comprehensive sign program will result in the elimination of existing unattractive signage and nonconforming signage and will result in an improvement to the appearance of the parcel proposed for development in comparison to signs otherwise permitted under the minimum sign standards. 
8.  Special area or scenic corridor plan. The signage proposed in a comprehensive sign program is consistent with any special area or scenic corridor plan which the City of Clearwater has prepared and adopted for the area in which the parcel proposed for development is located.

DIVISION 20. - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS 
 
Section 3-2001. - Telecommunication towers and antennas. 
A.  Purpose and goals. The purpose of this division is to establish general standards for the siting of telecommunications towers and antennas. The goals are to encourage the use of existing structures as an alternative to new tower construction, to encourage the joint use of new towers, to encourage the design and construction of towers and antennas which minimize the adverse visual impacts, and to enhance the ability of providers of telecommunications services to furnish such services within the city quickly, effectively and efficiently. It is not the intent of the city to discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services, or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services. 
B.  Applicability. Telecommunications towers and antennas installed and maintained in accordance with this division are exempt from the height limitations for buildings and structures set forth elsewhere in this development code. The requirements set forth in this division shall govern the height of towers and antennas. The installation of an antenna on a building which is nonconforming in terms of the height limitations of this division shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use. The installation of an antenna on an existing tower which is nonconforming in terms of the provisions of this division shall not be deemed to division shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use. Amateur radio antennas operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator are exempt from the provisions of this division. Home satellite dish antennas which are one meter or less in diameter and similar receive-only antennas are considered a residential accessory use, and are exempt from the requirements of this division. 
C.  Antennas. Antennas are an accessory use in all zoning districts. Antennas may be installed on existing structures, such as buildings, or other freestanding structures, provided the installation adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the structure and the antennas and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment are neutral in color and identical to, or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antennas and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Where possible, antennas should be architecturally screened or integrated into architectural elements. All antenna installations shall require a permit from the city. No lighting shall be permitted, except as may be required by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
D.  Telecommunication towers. 
1.  Anyone considering new tower construction must first explore the joint use of existing telecommunication towers or other existing buildings or structures as an alternative to new tower construction. Prior to the approval of a new tower, the community development coordinator shall make a determination that no existing tower or other structure is available as a reasonable alternative. An applicant requesting approval of a new tower shall submit evidence to the city that supports a conclusion that no reasonable use can be made of any existing tower or structure. The community development coordinator shall weigh and consider the following when determining whether approval of a telecommunication should be granted: 
a.  No existing tower or structure is located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's coverage requirements. 
b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
c.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with or would be interfered with by other antennas if placed on any existing tower or structure. 
e.  The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure for a time period of 25 years, exceed the cost of developing a new tower. 
f.  It is not financially feasible to modify or replace an existing tower to accommodate the proposed antenna. 
g.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other legitimate limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
2.  Permitted use modifications or replacement of towers and utility structures to accommodate co-location by Level One approval (minimum standard). 
a.  Modification or replacement of existing telecommunications towers. An existing telecommunications tower may be modified or replaced to accommodate the co-location of antennas as a permitted use, as follows: 
i.  Telecommunications towers which, when modified or replaced, will conform to the requirements of this Development Code, may be modified or relocated on the same zoning lot. 
ii.  Telecommunications towers which, when modified or replaced, will not conform tot he requirements of this development code, may be increased in height, up to forty feet above the originally approved height and/or relocated on the same zoning lot, one time, within 75 feet of the existing location without regard to setbacks or height related limitations. 
iii.  After a telecommunications tower is replaced, as provided herein, the existing telecommunications tower shall be removed within 90 days. 
iv.  The modified or replaced telecommunications tower shall be either of the same type as the existing telecommunications tower or a monopole. 
b.  Modification or replacement of existing utility structures other than telecommunications towers. An existing utility structure, such as light poles, power poles, electrical transmission towers, and the like, may be modified or replaced to accommodate both its prior function, and to service the placement of antennas as follows: 
i.  Such structures which, when modified or replaced, will conform to the height and placement requirements of this development code for the primary structure so modified or replaced, may be modified or relocated on the same zoning lot within the requirements of this Development Code 
ii.  Such structures which, when modified or replaced will not conform to the height and placement requirements of the Development Code for the primary structure may be: 
(1.)  Increased in height, one time, 
(2.)  If a distance greater than 100 percent of the height of the modified structure from any single-family residential structure, up to 50 percent of the height of the existing structure or a total of 140 feet, whichever is less; or 
(3.)  If a distance less than 100 percent of the height of the modified structure from any single-family residential structure, up to 25 percent of the height of the existing structure or a total of 140 feet, whichever is less; and/or 
(4.)  Relocated on the same zoning lot, one time, within 50 feet of the existing location, with administrative review and without conformance with any other setback, separation or height related requirements contained herein. 
(5.)  The modified or relocated structure shall comply with all applicable FCC and FAA regulations and applicable building codes. 
3.  Joint use of new towers required. Joint use of any new telecommunications tower is required whenever feasible. In order to promote joint use of new towers, prior to the issuance of a building permit for a new tower, the applicant shall demonstrate a commitment to joint use as follows: 
a.  Solicitation of additional users. The applicant requesting the permit shall submit evidence to the city demonstrating that a genuine effort has been made to solicit additional users for the proposed new tower. Evidence of this effort shall include, at minimum, copies of notices sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to all other providers of cellular and personal communication services in Pinellas County, Florida, advising of the intent to construct a new tower, identifying the location, inviting the joint use and sharing costs, and requesting a written response within 15 days. 
b.  Agreement to allow future joint use. The applicant shall sign an instrument, which shall be maintained by the city, agreeing to encourage and promote the joint use of telecommunications towers within the city and, to that extent, committing that there shall be no unreasonable act or omission that would have the effect of excluding, obstructing or delaying the joint use of any tower where fair and just compensation is offered for such use. 
4.  Design standards. 
a.  No telecommunication tower shall be located on Clearwater Beach. 
b.  Height. Single user towers are allowed a maximum height of 120 feet. Towers designed for joint use may be greater in height provided the additional height is constructed coincident with the actual use. Furthermore, existing conforming towers may be increased in height to accommodate additional users with a Level One approval (minimum standard). Towers designed for two users are allowed a maximum height of 140 feet. Towers designed for three or more users are allowed a maximum height of 160 feet. Up to 25 feet of additional height may be approved based on evidence that increased height would eliminate the need for additional towers. 
c.  Setbacks. 
i.  From residential uses. Towers shall be set back from existing residential uses a distance equal to the height of the tower. The distance shall be measured from the base of the tower to the residential property line. 
ii.  From historic districts and listed structures. Towers shall be set back a minimum of 500 feet from any National Register historic district and from any individual structure listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
iii.  From property lines. Towers shall be set back from property lines in accordance with the requirements set forth in the zoning district regulations. 
d.  Color and finish. Except for painting or marking required by the FAA, towers and supporting structures shall be a neutral, non-glare color or finish, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
e.  Fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by a six-foot high security, masonry or wood fence. 
f.  Landscaping/screening. 
i.  The perimeter of the tower site shall be buffered with shrubs selected and placed to screen the base of the tower and, to the extent possible, with trees selected and placed to minimize the vertical scale of the tower. A minimum of ten feet of landscape buffer shall be provided around the outside of the required fencing. The landscaping design requires approval of a landscaping plan by the community development coordinator as a Level One approval (minimum standard) in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 Division 3 of this development code. 
ii.  If the telecommunication tower is located within a scenic corridor designated by the City of Clearwater or a scenic noncommercial corridor as designated in the Countywide Plan for Pinellas County, the applicant must demonstrate compliance with the design criteria in those designations. 
g.  Illumination. Towers shall not be artificially lighted except as required by the FAA. At time of construction of a tower, in cases where there are residential uses located within a distance which is 300 percent of the height of the tower from the tower, dual mode lighting shall be requested from the FAA. 
h.  Appurtenances. Appurtenant buildings and structures shall conform to the standards set forth in the zoning district regulations. Such buildings and structures shall be screened from adjacent properties and public streets. At a tower site, design of the buildings and related structures shall, when practicable, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings to minimize the visual impact. 
i.  Design. To the extent practicable, the tower shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment in order to protect the aesthetics of the neighborhood where the tower is proposed. 
j.  Waivers. The design standards identified above may be reduced or waived if such reduction or waiver would better satisfy the intent of this division and such modification or waiver is reviewed and decided by the community development coordinator in concert with the application for a Level One (minimum standard) approval. 
5.  Advertising prohibited; required signage and security. No tower shall be used for advertising of any type, and the placement of signs, other than warning signs and small in/or mat on placecards with emergency and owner information, is prohibited.

ARTICLE 4. - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND OTHER PROCEDURES 
_____ 
DIVISION 1. - REQUIRED PERMITS AND APPROVALS 
This Development Code establishes the following types of development approvals: Level One, Level Two, and Level Three. Level One approvals involve those development proposals which are reviewed and approved by the city's professional staff. Level Two approvals are those development proposals which are more complex and involve the use of greater discretion by an appointed board accountable, through the appointment process, to the city commission. Level Three approvals are those approvals which state law requires action by the city council because they involve issues of public policy in the first instance. The following graphic portrays this concept of different levels of approval: 
 
*Hotel Density Reserve Development Agreements are not reviewed by the Community Development Board. Both required public hearings take place before City Council.
The divisions in this article establish the requirements for each type of approval beginning with general procedures which are applicable to all three levels of approval and a graphic (flow chart) describing the process for each type of approval.

An applicant for a Level One approval (minimum development standards) shall submit an application in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4-202.A and F to the community development coordinator who shall review the application in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4-202.C and D and determine whether the application demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this Development Code. Within 15 working days of a determination of sufficiency, the community development coordinator shall approve the application, deny the application or approve with conditions necessary to make the proposed development conforming with the applicable general and specific requirements set out in Articles 2 and 3 including the provisions of Section 3-914 in regard to general standards for approval conditions. 
2.  It is acknowledged that changes of use may be proposed whereby conformance with all of the applicable general and specific requirements set out in Article 2 may not be possible or practicable. In those situations the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  If there is no difference in the established development standards between an existing use and a proposed use that is permissible as a minimum standard use in the zoning district of the subject property, then the change of use may be processed as a Level One (minimum standard) approval even if the structures and/or properties involved are nonconforming with regard to said development standards, provided that the site is brought into compliance to the greatest extent practicable with the parking and landscaping standards set out in Article 3. 
b.  If there is a difference in the established development standards between an existing use and a proposed use that is permissible as a minimum standard use in the zoning district of the subject property, but the proposed use would have a lesser impact, then the change of use may be processed as a Level One (minimum standard) approval even if the structures and/or properties involved are nonconforming with regard to said development standards, provided that the site is brought into compliance to the greatest extent practicable with the parking and landscaping standards set out in Article 3. 
c.  If there is a difference in the established development standards between an existing use and a proposed use that is permissible as a minimum standard use in the zoning district of the subject property and the proposed use would have a greater impact, but still meet the parameters established below, then the change of use may be processed as a Level One (minimum standard) approval even if the structures and/or properties involved are nonconforming with regard to said development standards, provided the site is brought into compliance to the greatest extent practicable with the parking and landscape standards set forth in Article 3. 
1.  The building or tenant space, as applicable, is less than 5,000 square feet; and 
2.  The change of use cannot create a nonconforming situation with regard to the provision of off-street parking. In the instance where the existing use is currently nonconforming with regard to the provision of off-street parking, the resulting change of use cannot exacerbate this nonconformity by more than ten percent; and 
3.  Eligible uses include only offices, retail sales and services, and mixed-use (the commercial component of which may only include office or retail sales and services); and 
4.  If the existing development was part of a Level Two (Flexible Development) development approval, then the proposed change of use must comply with the provisions of Section 4-406. 
d.  With regard to the above provisions, "lesser impact" and "greater impact" shall be based upon the difference in development standards between the two uses. 
B.  Level One approval (flexible standard development). An applicant for Level One approval (flexible standard development) shall submit an application in accordance with the requirements of Section 4-202 (A) and (F) to the community development coordinator who shall review the application with the development review committee in accordance with the requirements of Section 4-202 (C) and (D) and determine whether the application demonstrates compliance with this Development Code. Within 20 working days of a determination of sufficiency, the community development coordinator shall approve the application, or approve with conditions necessary to make the proposed development conforming with the applicable general and specific requirements set out in Articles 2 and 3, including the provisions of Section 3-913 in regard to general standards for approval conditions, or deny the application for failure to meet the applicable requirements and standards.

Section 4-303. - Effect of Level One (flexible standard development) approval. 
A Level One (flexible standard development) approval authorizes only the particular use approved and entitles the recipient to apply for a building permit or any other permit required by this Development Code, the city or regional, state or federal agencies. Such approval shall be evidenced by a written development order issued by the community development coordinator and shall be effective upon the date the development order is issued. Unless otherwise specified in the Level One (flexible standard development) approval, an application for a building permit shall be made within one year of the date of the Level One (flexible standard development) approval, and all required certificates of occupancy shall be obtained within two years of the date of issuance of the initial building permit. The permit must be obtained within six months of the initial permit application. This timeframe may be extended for an additional six months for cause by the community development coordinator. 
Permitted time frames do not change with successive owners and an extension of time may be granted by the community development coordinator for a period not to exceed one year and only within the original period of validity. The community development coordinator may approve an additional extension of time not to exceed one year for good cause shown and documented in writing. The coordinator must receive the request for this extension within the one-year period of validity after the original time extension. Good causes may include, but are not limited to, an unexpected national crisis (acts of war, significant downturn in the national economy, etc.), excessive weather-related delays, and the like. The community development coordinator may also consider whether significant progress on the project is being made and whether or not there are pending or approved Code amendments which would significantly affect the project. In the event a project is governed by a development agreement, the timeframes established in the agreement shall supercede these requirements.

Section 4-406. - Changes to Level Two development approvals. 
A.  Minor revisions. The community development coordinator is authorized to allow minor revisions to an approved Level Two approved after receipt of comments from the development review committee. A minor revision is one which: 
1.  Does not result in conflicts in on-site circulation and/or negative impacts with ingress/egress. 
2.  Does not change the use unless such change is of a similar or less intensity, as determined by the community development coordinator. 
3.  Does not increase the density or intensity of the development 
4.  Does not result in a reduction of setback or previously required landscape area. 
5.  Does not result in a substantial change to the location of a structure previously approved.

An extension of time to initiate a building permit may be granted by the community development coordinator provided it is for a period not to exceed one year, is for the project originally approved and provided good cause is shown and documented in writing within the original period of validity. The community development coordinator may also consider whether significant progress on the project is being made and whether or not there are pending or approved Code amendments which would significantly affect the project. The community development board may approve one additional extension of time after the community development coordinator's extension to initiate a building permit application. Such extension shall not exceed one year, shall be for the project originally approved and shall be for good cause shown and documented in writing. The community development board must receive the request for this extension within the one-year period of validity after the original extension approved by the community development coordinator. Good causes may include but are not limited to an unexpected national crisis (acts of war, significant downturn in the national economy, etc.), excessive weather-related delays, and the like. In the event a project is governed by a development agreement, the timeframes established in the agreement shall supercede these requirements. The community development board may also consider whether significant progress on the project is being made and whether or not there are pending or approved Code amendments which would significantly affect the project. Amendments which will require no or minor amendments (as provided by Section 4-406(A)) may be approved. Amendments which will require a major revision to the subject project shall be required to be approved as part of a new Level Two application. Transfer of development rights are exempt from this provision.

The time frame set for the plan study shall be reflective of the extent of the area under consideration and the complexity of the issues that may be addressed. The scope of the study shall be identified through a joint process involving the neighborhood services manager, community development coordinator and the leadership of the study committee. The study committee shall serve as an advisory body during the special area planning process and shall hold at least four public meetings during the process. The city manager shall provide staff assistance to the study committee and the study committee shall approve a special area plan including the goals, policies and objectives for the proposed neighborhood conservation district, a specification of the provisions of this Development Code which would otherwise be applicable which should be modified for the proposed neighborhood conservation district and a specification of additional development standards which are necessary and appropriate to protect the health, safety and welfare of the proposed neighborhood conservation district.

Within 30 days after receipt of such petition and explanation, the city manager shall submit a written recommendation to the commission as to whether the neighborhood conservation district amendment or elimination process should be commenced. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the city manager, the city commission shall consider the petition at a public meeting and determine whether to commence the amendment or elimination process. The amendment or deletion of the overlay district shall follow the same process and notice requirements as the original adoption. 
E.  Requirements of the neighborhood. Any neighborhood which receives neighborhood conservation overlay district designation shall be a partner with the city in implementing the provisions of such overlay district by committing to the following: 
1.  Educating neighborhood property owners of the requirements of the overlay district at least two times a year through neighborhood association meetings and/ mailing or any other methods approved by the community development director; and

b.  Private property shall not be taken without due process of law and the payment of just compensation. In this context the term "taken" does not mean that the owner has been deprived of the highest and best use of the property, but that the owner has been deprived of all reasonable use of the property, whether temporarily or permanently. 
2.  The rules of equity set out in this subsection are derived from the state constitution and the common law of the state, and in any case in which it is made to appear that a decision will violate either rule, that result shall be avoided. 
(Ord. No. 6526-00, § 1, 6-15-00)  
Section 4-610. - Governmental action affecting mobile home owners. 
A.  Purpose and applicability. It is the purpose of this section to establish a procedure for determining that adequate mobile home parks or other suitable facilities exist for the relocation of the mobile home owners pursuant to F.S. § 723.083 (hereinafter referred to as "the Determination"), when an applicant has filed for rezoning or any other official action that would result in the removal or relocation of mobile home owners residing in a mobile home park other than a resident-owned park. This section shall apply to any application for Level One, Two or Three approval that would result in the removal or relocation of mobile home owners residing in a mobile home park other than a resident-owned park, hereinafter referred to as a qualifying official governmental action ("QOGA"). Resident-owned parks involved in legally sanctioned and voluntary applications for changes of zoning are specifically excluded from the provisions of this ordinance. Level One or Two approvals shall be contingent upon the determination required herein. If the application includes more than one Level Three approval the hearing shall be conducted concurrently. 
B.  Application/initiation requirements. An application for Level One, Two or Three approval that would result in the removal or relocation of mobile home owners residing in a mobile home park other than a resident-owned park, shall include such information as is applicable in Section 4-202(A). 
C.  Staff review and recommendation. After the community development coordinator has reviewed the application with the development review committee in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-202(C) and (D), he shall send a written report and recommendation to the community development board, with a copy to the applicant, setting forth a recommended determination of approval, approval with conditions or denial and the grounds for such recommendation. 
D.  Community development board review/recommendation. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the community development coordinator, the community development board shall conduct a public hearing on the Determination request in accordance with the requirements of Section 4-206 and issue a recommended order to the city council setting forth the board's findings in regard to whether the applicant has demonstrated that adequate mobile home parks or other suitable facilities exist for the relocation of the mobile home owners based on the standards set forth in Section 4-610 G. and may include any proposed conditions. 
E.  City council review/decision. Upon receipt of the recommended order of the community development board, the city council shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-206. If the council is satisfied that the evidence indicates that adequate mobile home parks or other suitable facilities exist for the relocation of the eligible displaced mobile home owners, it shall make a finding of such and the condition for approval shall be met. If the council is not satisfied that the evidence indicates the existence of adequate mobile home parks or other suitable facilities for the relocation of the eligible displaced mobile home owners, the finding shall state such and the QOGA shall be denied or approved conditionally as provided in subsection F. below. 
F.  Upon determining that there is a lack of competent substantial evidence to support an affirmative finding under F.S. § 723.083, Florida Mobile Home Act, the council may grant a conditional approval under the following conditions: 
1.  The applicant shall deposit monies into the Supplemental Rental Assistance Payment Fund (Chapter 34, Article I, Code of Ordinances) for purposes of assuring that rental assistance is available for all eligible mobile home owners for whom affordable mobile home parks or other suitable facilities cannot be identified, and 
2.  The full supplemental rental assistance payment amount must be deposited prior to issuance of any permits for the site, and 
3.  No notice of eviction for change of use of property shall be given or effective unless the mobile home park owner shall have first paid to the city an amount equal to the city's actual out-of-pocket cost to qualify mobile home owners and provide initial counseling times the number of owner-occupied mobile homes located in the mobile home park as provided in Article 34 of the Code of Ordinances, and 
4.  No later than the date the notice of eviction for change of use is given to mobile home owners, the applicant will notify mobile home owners of their rights under Article 34 including possible eligibility for rental assistance payments if affordable replacement or relocation facilities cannot be identified. 
5.  Alternatively, an applicant may provide an alternative means of meeting the requirements of F.S. § 723.083 by addressing in a manner acceptable to the council any affordability gap, using the criteria defined herein, between the cost of the identified replacement unit and the affordable rent as published by the State of Florida's State Housing Initiative Partnership Program for the mobile home owner's household income category. Any such alternative means shall meet the spirit and intent of the supplemental rental assistance payment fund. 
The granting of such conditional approval pursuant to this section will provide a presumption that the provisions of F.S. Ch. 723.083 have been satisfied. 
G.  Standards for review. 
1.  The proposed determination is consistent with and furthers the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan and furthers the purposes of this Development Code and other city ordinances and actions designed to implement the plan. 
2.  The council shall review all information provided and shall make its decision based on substantial and competent evidence. 
(Ord. No. 7616-06, § 3, 5-18-06)  
DIVISION 7. - SUBDIVISIONS/PLATS 
 
Section 4-701. - Purpose and applicability. 
The purpose of this division is to establish procedures and standards for the subdivision of land to ensure the orderly layout of property, to ensure proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided property, and to implement the comprehensive plan. A plat shall be approved for all subdivisions and condominiums within the corporate limits of the city, except: 
A.  The reversion, combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where no new parcels or residual parcels are created which are smaller than any of the original lots or smaller than the applicable minimum lot area requirements in Article 2 of this Development Code. 
B.  The conveyance of a lot or tract to an adjacent lot or tract which neither reduces any lot or tract to an area or width less than required in Article 2 of this Development Code for the zoning district in which the lot or tract is located nor is inconsistent with any other provision of this development code. 
C.  The division of previously platted property where: 
1.  Not more than two tracts or lots are involved; 
2.  No new street or alley is proposed or additional right-of-way is required; 
3.  No vacation or elimination of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required or proposed; 
4.  All easement requirements have been or will be satisfied; 
5.  The division will not result in a tract or lot that does not have direct access to a street; 
6.  The division complies with all the provisions of this development code. 
D.  Applications for minor lot adjustments shall include a survey of the existing lots and a survey and legal description of the proposed new lots. The community development coordinator shall process applications as a Level One (minimum standard) approval and all new lots shall comply with the minimum lot size, width, setback, ISR and FAR requirements required by the zoning district in which the property is located. After such new lots are recorded in the county, the applicant shall file copies of the recorded legal descriptions and survey with the community development director. The city engineer shall be responsible for recording such approved lot adjustments on the city's Zoning Atlas. 
(Ord. No. 6526-00, § 1, 6-15-00)  
Section 4-702. - Required approvals. 
If plat approval is required, approval is obtained in two stages: preliminary and final plat approval and is intended to be processed simultaneously with other required approvals. Preliminary approval is granted by city staff for Level One (flexible standard) approvals and the community development board for Level Two approvals. In the event a Level Two approval is required, the preliminary plat is a required submission and will be reviewed and approved by the community development board as part of that approval process. While city council approval is required by state law for final plats, the approval process is ministerial, assuming compliance with the preliminary plat approval and all requirements of the City Code. If plat approval is required, final plat approval must be obtained before a building permit may be issued.

Section 4-902. - Application and procedures. 
A.  An application for a certificate of concurrency/capacity shall be filed with the community development coordinator as part of an application for development approval and shall include such fees as are required by Section 4-202(F). 
B.  The community development coordinator shall review the application and determine whether the application complies with the standards in Section 4-903. If the community development coordinator determines that the application complies with the standards, a certificate of concurrency/capacity shall be issued and shall be valid for a period of two years or such later period as may be provided for in a development approval. 
C.  In the event that an application for a certificate of concurrency/capacity is approved, the applicant shall pay prior to the issuance of the certificate, a fee in the form of prepayment of the capacity being reserved, or some other financial assurance provided by the applicant that is acceptable to the city. The certificate of concurrency/capacity fee may be refunded if development does not proceed so long as the city has not expended or obligated the money for preconstruction costs or construction of the facility, if the road impact fee has not been transferred to the county. If the road impact fee portion has been transferred to the county, the applicant may request a refund from the county. 
D.  A certificate of concurrency/capacity may be extended according to the same terms and conditions as the underlying development approval. If a development approval is granted an extension, the certificate of concurrency/capacity, if any, shall also be extended. 
E.  A certificate of concurrency/capacity may be extended to remain in effect for the life of each subsequent development approval for the same parcel, as long as the applicant obtains a subsequent development approval prior to the expiration of the earlier development approval. 
F.  A certificate of concurrency/capacity runs with the land and is valid only for subsequent development approvals for the same parcel and to new owners of the original parcel for which it was issued. 
G.  A certificate of concurrency/capacity shall expire if the underlying development order expires or is revoked by the city and the capacity has not been extended to a subsequent development approval for the same parcel. 
H.  A denial of a certificate of concurrency/capacity may be appealed in the manner provided in Article 4, Division 5. 
(Ord. No. 8070-09, § 13, 12-3-09)  
Section 4-903. - Standards for certificate of concurrency/capacity. 
A.  In determining whether a certificate of concurrency/capacity may be issued, the community development coordinator shall apply the level of service standards in the comprehensive plan according to the following measures for each public facility: 
1.  Potable water: water service area. 
2.  Sanitary sewer: sewer facility availability. 
3.  Drainage: drainage basin. 
4.  Solid waste: citywide. 
5.  Parks and recreation: citywide. 
B.  For public facilities provided by entities other than the city, the certificate may be issued subject to the availability of such public facilities consistent with policy I.1.3.3 of the comprehensive plan. 
C.  If the capacity of available public facilities is less than the capacity required to maintain the level of service standard for the impact of the development, the applicant may:

(Ord. No. 7718-06, § 1, 11-15-06; Ord. No. 8028-09, § 2, 6-4-09; Ord. No. 8346-12, § 1, 11-1-12; Ord. No. 8806-16, §§ 5, 6, 5-5-16)  
Section 4-904. - Mobility management system. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to provide a more flexible and efficient alternative to the traditional form of transportation concurrency management, which ties development approvals to maintaining adopted roadway level of service standards, while facilitating multi-modal transportation solutions. 
B.  Applicability. The mobility management system shall apply to all developments in the City of Clearwater, pursuant to the requirements of 4-904.C. 
C.  General requirements. All development projects within the City of Clearwater that generate new peak hour trips are subject to the provisions of this section to address their development impacts. Determination of trip generation associated with an application for development shall be based on Schedule A or B in Section 150-40 of Pinellas County Land Development Code, or the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual. As an alternative to the fee schedule and Trip Generation Manual, the applicant may submit a trip generation study in accordance with Section 4-905.C.4.a. and b. 
1.  Deficient road corridors include parcels, all or a portion of which lie within a corridor, and are defined as: 
a.  Sole direct access. A condition where the only means of site ingress/egress is directly onto the road facility, regardless of the distance of that site from the facility; 
b.  Direct access. A condition in which one or more existing or potential site ingress/egress points makes a direct connection to the road facility and the site is within one-half mile of the road facility; and 
c.  Sole indirect access. A condition where the only point of site ingress/egress is onto a public non-arterial roadway which makes its first and shortest arterial level connection onto a road facility regardless of the distance of that site from the facility. 
2.  Deficient road corridors are listed within the most recent Pinellas County Metropolitan Planning Organization's annual Level of Service Report. 
3.  Development projects that generate less than 51 new peak hour trips are required to pay a multi-modal impact fee in accordance with Section 4-905. They are not required to submit a transportation management plan or study. 
4.  Tier 1 projects. Tier 1 projects are development projects that generate between 51 and 300 new peak hour trips. 
a.  Developers of Tier 1 projects located within deficient road corridors are required to submit a transportation management plan designed to address their impacts while increasing mobility and reducing the demand for single occupant vehicle travel. 
b.  The cost of transportation management strategies implemented for Tier 1 projects are creditable toward their multi-modal impact fee assessment. If the cost of the improvement exceeds the assessment, the development project would not be subject to payment of the fee. 
5.  Tier 2 projects. Tier 2 projects are development projects that generate more than 300 new peak hour trips. 
a.  Developers of Tier 2 projects within deficient road corridors are required to conduct a traffic study and submit an accompanying report. The report shall include the results of the traffic study and a transportation management plan identifying improvements necessary to mitigate the impacts of the project. 
b.  The cost of transportation management strategies implemented for Tier 2 projects may be applied as credit toward the project's multi-modal impact fee assessment or payment of the fee could be included as part of a transportation management plan. 
6.  Development projects that generate more than 50 new peak hour trips on non-deficient road corridors shall be reviewed by the city to determine if the impacts of the project adversely affect the level of service of the surrounding road network. If it is determined that approval of the development project reduces the level of service of the adjacent road(s) to peak hour level of service E or F or would cause the volume-to-capacity ratio to reach or exceed 0.9, a transportation management plan is required. The applicant may submit a traffic study to verify whether their project would affect the level of service of adjacent road(s). A transportation management plan is required if the results of the traffic study confirm the finding of the city, and the transportation management plan for such developments shall comply with the requirements of Tier 1 or Tier 2 projects, as described in Sections 4-904.C.2. and 3. 
7.  Transportation management plans. At the time of site plan review, the city shall analyze the development impacts of a project. A transportation management plan is required for development applications subject to Sections 4-904C.3, 4, and 5, utilizing transportation management strategies/improvements to address their development impacts. The extent of the strategies/improvements included in an approved transportation management plan in terms of the scale of the project(s) and roadway capacity and/or mobility benefits provided shall be based primarily on the project(s) impact on the surrounding traffic circulation system. Specific conditions of the deficient road corridor impacted by the development shall also be considered. 
Transportation management plans must be developed by the applicant and accepted by the city. If the project impacts a State road, the applicant shall also submit the transportation management plan to the Florida Department of Transportation District 7 Office. Transportation management plans seeking to implement strategies that do not involve structural improvements, such as ride sharing and transit incentive programs, must include a monitoring program to ensure the strategies are carried out in accordance with the plan. Site-related improvements are not eligible for inclusion in transportation management plans. Transportation management plan strategies/improvements include, but are not limited to, those listed below: 
a.  Intensity reduction. The intensity of the proposal may be reduced through an across-the-board reduction of the permitted floor area ratio, as it would otherwise normally apply to the proposal. Other such corrective actions that would reduce the intensity of the proposal may also apply. 
b.  Density reduction. The density of the proposal may be decreased by a reduction in the number of units per acre below that which would otherwise normally apply to the proposal. 
c.  Project phasing. A project may be divided into logical phases of development by area, with later phases of the development proposal's approval withheld until the needed facilities are available. 
d.  Outparcel deletion. Those portions of the proposal characterized as outparcels that create separate and unique impacts may be deleted from the total proposal. 
e.  Physical highway improvements. A project may construct link capacity improvements, acceleration/deceleration lanes, intersection improvements, or frontage roads. 
f.  Operational improvements (signal). This includes efforts involving signal removal or signal timing improvements. 
g.  Access management strategies. These include access management controls such as the preclusion of a direct connection to a level of service deficient facility, right-in/right-out driveways, alternative driveway locations, reduction of a driveway, single point access, shared access, or the implementation of median controls. 
h.  Mass transit initiatives. A project may implement a plan to encourage transit (e.g., employer-issued bus passes). Other mass transit initiatives may include, but are not limited to, the construction of bus stop amenities, bus pull-off areas, and dedication of park and ride parking spaces. 
i.  Demand management/commuter assistance. These include efforts to encourage ride-sharing (e.g., designated parking spaces for carpools, employer-sponsored carpool programs, participation in transportation management organization/initiative programs), and implementing flexible work hour and telecommuting programs. 
j.  Bicycle/pedestrian improvements. These would involve structural improvements or construction of a bikeway or sidewalk connecting an existing bikeway/sidewalk network or providing access to a school, park, shopping center, etc. These improvements may also include pedestrian treatments in parking areas, sidewalks connecting developments with adjacent land uses, trail improvements and bicycle rack and on-street bicycle lane installations, and the planting of trees to provide shade canopy along sidewalks. 
k.  Intelligent transportation system improvements. This includes improvements pertaining to computerized traffic signal systems that automatically adjust to maximize traffic flow and to permit emergency vehicles to pass through intersections quickly. It also includes freeway management systems, such as electronic message signs, and electronic fare payment on public buses that reduce passenger boarding time. 
l.  Livable community site design features. These include, but are not limited to, implementation of pedestrian friendly site design features such as orienting buildings toward the street and parking lots to the side or rear of buildings. 
(Ord. No. 8806-16, § 7, 5-5-16) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 8806-16, § 7, adopted May 5, 2016, repealed the former § 4-904, and enacted a new § 4-904 as set out herein. The former § 4-904 pertained to proportionate fair-share program and derived from Ord. No. 7718-06, § 2, 11-15-06.  
Section 4-905. - Multi-modal impact fee. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish the required payment of multi-modal impact fees, the computation of those fees, fee credits, disposition of funds, refunding of fees, and exemptions of fees. 
B.  Fee required. The payment of a multi-modal impact fee shall be required in the manner and amount set forth in this section. 
1.  Any person who seeks a certificate of occupancy for any land development activity or seeks to change a use by applying for issuance of a building permit which will generate additional traffic shall be required to pay a multi-modal impact fee. 
2.  No certificate of occupancy or building permit requiring payment of a multi-modal impact fee pursuant to Section 4-905.C. shall be issued unless and until the multi-modal impact fee has been paid. 
3.  Any person who has submitted a site plan or building permit application in accordance with land development codes prior to the adoption of Ord. No. 8806-16 shall be subject to the terms of the ordinance that was in effect at the time the site plan or building permit application was submitted. 
C.  Computation of amount. The amount of the multi-modal impact fees imposed under this section will depend on a number of factors, including the type of land development activity, and several fixed elements, such as the average cost to construct one lane-mile of roadway ($2,216,466.00) and the average capacity of one lane-mile of roadway (6,900 vehicles per day). 
1.  The following formula shall be used by the city to determine the impact fee per unit of development: 
TGR × %NT × TL × CST (RF) 
   CAP × 2 
WHERE: 
TGR = Trip generation rate, as per fee schedule 
%NT = percent new trips 
TL = Average trip length, varies by land use 
CST = The cost to construct one lane-mile of roadway ($2,216,466.00) 
CAP = The capacity of one lane-mile of roadway (6,900 vehicles per lane, per day) 
2 = Allocation of one-half the impact to the origin and one-half to the destination 
RF = Reduction factor (0.268) 
2.  At the option of the feepayer, the amount of the multi-modal impact fee may be determined by the Impact Fee Schedule A or B in Section 150-40 of the Pinellas Land Development Code. 
3.  In the case of a new use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the impact fee for the highest previous use in existence on or after the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives. The city shall be guided in this determination by the County's transportation impact fee study (February 1990), independent study trip generation data, or the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation, sixth (or successor) edition. 
4.  If a feepayer opts to not have the impact fee determined according to subsections 1 or 2 of this section, then the feepayer shall prepare and submit to the city for approval of an independent fee calculation study for the land development activity for which a certificate of occupancy or building permit is sought. The traffic engineering and/or economic documentation submitted, which will require a pre-application meeting with the city, shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made, including, but not limited to the following: 
a.  Traffic engineering studies: 
1.  Documentation of trip generation rates appropriate for the proposed land development activity. 
2.  Documentation of trip length appropriate for the proposed land development activity. 
3.  Documentation of the cost per land mile for roadway construction for the proposed land development activity. 
b.  Economic documentation studies: 
1.  Documentation of the cost per lane per mile for roadway construction for the proposed land development activity. 
2.  Documentation of credits attributable to the proposed land development activity which the feepayer will make available to replace the portion of the service volume used by the traffic generated by the proposed land development activity. 
5.  Trip generation documentation other than traffic engineering or economic documentation studies, as described in Section 4-905.C.4.a and b may be submitted by the applicant in consideration of an independent fee calculation. 
D.  Payment of fees and credits. The person applying for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or building permit shall pay the multi-modal impact fee to the city prior to the issuance of such permit. Fees for mobile homes shall be payable prior to issuance of the permits which allow the mobile home to move on to a lot. Fees shall be collected as part of the normal permitting process of the city. The city manager or his designee shall have full collection authority as well as full discretion for approval of alternative methods for calculation of impact fees on a case-by-case basis. All funds collected under this section shall be promptly transferred for deposit into the appropriate impact fee trust account. 
E.  Fee credits. The following improvements to the transportation system may be eligible for credit against the multi-modal impact fee or an impact fee adjustment or reduction. Certain site related improvements or land dedicated for related right-of-way shall not be given any credit towards the impact fee. 
1.  Construction of on-site trail, pedestrian, or bicycle facility if part of a trail, bicycle, or pedestrian network identified in Metropolitan Planning Organization Long Range Transportation Plan or the Clearwater Comprehensive Plan is eligible for credit against impact fee assessment. 
2.  All transportation improvements required under a city approved development order issued for a new development or a development of regional impact approved prior to the adoption date [May 5, 2016] of the ordinance from which this section derives shall be credited against multi-modal impact fees up to the total amount of the impact fee. Those improvements deemed as site-related or on-site, shall not be credited against the multi-modal impact fee. 
3.  Mixed-use developments consisting of complementary land uses that are designed with connectivity to allow for a reduction in trip lengths and/or percent new trips are eligible for an impact fee rate adjustment based on trip generation data for similar uses. 
4.  Commuter assistance programs with long-term contract(s) facilitating ride sharing activity are eligible for an impact fee rate reduction based on the reduction in the number of single-occupant vehicle trips that would otherwise be associated with the project. 
5.  Bus stop shelters, including pads, are eligible for a credit against the impact fee assessment in an amount equal to the cost of the improvement or one percent of the fee, whichever is greater. 
6.  Construction of shared driveway(s) between adjacent properties is eligible for a credit against the impact fee assessment in the amount that is 50 percent of the construction cost for the portion of the driveway that is located off-site. 
7.  Construction of shared inter-connecting parking lots is eligible for a credit against the impact fee assessment in an amount that is 50 percent of the construction cost for the portion of the parking area located off-site. 
8.  Sidewalks constructed for credit against impact fee assessments must provide connection between the site and surrounding sidewalk network and/or major destination point such as a park, shopping center, school, community center, etc. 
9.  Pedestrian and bicycle facilities connecting neighboring properties may be eligible for credit against impact fees for the portion of the construction that is off-site. 
10.  Off-site crosswalk enhancements, including curb bulb-out at intersection, pavement marking, or raised crossings are eligible for credit against impact fee assessment. 
11.  The city manager or his or her designee may accept an offer by the feepayer to implement all or part of a transportation improvement project consistent with the Clearwater Comprehensive Plan or the metropolitan planning organization's long range transportation plan. The project(s) may be for any mode of transportation, including rail, transit, pedestrian, or bicycle, providing that it serves to add to the capacity of the surrounding transportation circulation system or to increase mobility and reduce the dependence on automobile travel. This offer shall not include site-related or on-site improvements. These transportation improvements must be in accordance with city, county, or state requirements, whichever are applicable. The feepayer shall provide the following to the city manager or his designee to determine consistency with city requirements: 
a.  Submit an offer to make improvements in lieu of a fee payment; and 
b.  A letter detailing the improvements to be made, improvement plans, and a construction cost estimate in sufficient detail. 
If the city manager or his designee accepts such an offer, the cost of the improvement project, except for the improvements identified in Sections 4-905.E.5, 6, and 7, shall be credited against the multi-modal impact fee assessed on the proposed development. Upon satisfactory completion and construction approval of the transportation improvement made in lieu of all or a portion of the impact fee due, the improvement shall be accepted by the city for future maintenance. If the certificate of occupancy is requested prior to the completion of the approved project, then a performance bond shall be provided to the city manager or his designee to cover the balance of all work required following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
12.  Sections 4-905.E.1 through 11 do not apply to development projects that are subject to the requirements of Sections 4-904.C.4 and 5. 
F.  Disposition of funds. Funds collected from multi-modal impact fees shall be used exclusively for the purpose of projects that improve the capacity of the surrounding traffic circulation system. These projects may involve improvements to transportation modes such as transit, pedestrian, and bicycle travel as well as roadway expansion. Such improvements shall be of the type as are made necessary by the new development. Specific projects to receive funds from impact fees collected shall be determined by city council. Priorities for impact fee funded transportation improvements shall be established by city council in compliance with adopted plans and the transportation improvement program of the metropolitan planning organization. 
1.  No funds collected under this article shall be used for periodic maintenance, as defined in F.S. Chapter 334, as amended. 
2.  Fees collected within a community development or tax increment financing district shall be expended within such district. If the project(s) benefit the district from where the fees were collected, the fees can be expended in a neighboring district. Parking garages for general public purposes shall be considered eligible transportation improvements within such areas or districts. 
3.  Multi-modal impact fees collected by the city shall be held by the city until the end of the fiscal year in which collected. At the beginning of each new fiscal year, one-half of all fees collected, and the accrued interest thereon, less the four percent retained from the total fee collected for administrative costs, shall be forwarded to the board of county commissioners for placement in the appropriate trust account. The remaining one-half shall be deposited in the city's multi-modal impact fee trust account. All fees must be disbursed, encumbered, or refunded by the city in a manner consistent with this section. 
4.  If the city wishes to expend the portion of the fees which are due to the county, the city may do so with the approval of the county administrator and the city manager or his or her designee. 
5.  Multi-modal impact fees collected on the state road network within the city may be made available for construction of improvements on the state road network within the city. 
6.  Multi-modal impact fee funds shall be administered as an independent component of the capital improvement element of the Clearwater Comprehensive Plan, as required by F.S. Chapter 163. Each fiscal year, the city manager or his or her designee shall present to city council the district improvement programs for transportation expenditures. These programs shall assign transportation improvement costs and related expenses to the trust account for specific transportation improvement projects. Monies, including any accrued interest not assigned in any fiscal year, shall be retained in the same impact fee trust account until the next fiscal year, except as provided by the refund provisions of this section. The city shall retain four percent of the fees collected for administrative costs. 
G.  Refund of fee paid. Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten years from the date that the multi-modal impact fee was paid, upon application of the feepayer, within 180 days of that date, be returned to the feepayer with interest at a yearly rate to be determined by the Consumer Price Index effective January 1, which is to be applied to the preceding year for each year the deposit is held. 
H.  Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from payment of the multi-modal impact fee: 
1.  Alteration or expansion of an existing building where no additional units or floor area are created, use is not changed, and where no additional vehicular trips will be produced over and above that produced by the existing use; 
2.  The construction of accessory buildings or structures which will not produce additional vehicular trips over and above that produced by the principal building or use of the land; 
3.  The replacement of a building or structure with a new building or structure of the same use provided that no additional trips will be produced over and above those produced by the original building or structure; and 
4.  The construction of publicly-owned facilities used primarily for traditional government uses.

Sec. 4-1505. - Conflicting applications. 
A.  Because the potential exists for the inadvertent issuance of permits to adult use establishments that violate the locational provisions of Article 3 Division 3, the community development coordinator shall develop a system for tracking applications and for ranking them by date and time of application and date that an adult use establishment existing on October 15, 1998, was established or commenced business. 
B.  Between two applications being processed at the same time, the applicant who filed first shall be considered to be the operator of the conforming adult use establishment, if that application is approved and if no other reason exists to consider the establishment nonconforming. Between applicants, one of whom or both of whom operated adult use establishments that existed at the premises on or before October 15, 1998, the adult use establishment that first established or commenced business at the location shall be considered to be conforming if no other reason exists to consider the establishment nonconforming.  
DIVISION 16. - UNITY OF TITLE DECLARATION 
 
Section 4-1601. - Unity of title. 
A.  Where it is necessary that two or more lots, plots, parcels, or portions thereof be added or joined, in whole or in part, to meet minimum plot area or plot dimensions required by this development code, or to ensure that a development is planned, developed and maintained as an integral project, an application for development approval for such property shall be accompanied by evidence of recording a unity of title declaration, as described in this section, in the public records of the county. 
B.  All lots, plots, parcels, or portions thereof to be joined, in whole or in part, under a unity of title declaration shall be adjacent and shall not be physically separated by a public right-of-way greater than 100 feet in width. 
C.  Two or more lots, plots, parcels or portions thereof may be joined, in whole or in part, if the lots, plots, parcels or portions thereof are physically separated only by a public right-of-way 100 feet or less in width unless approved as part of a Level One or Level Two approval. In such cases, the right-of-way shall not be included in determining the plot area, depth or width, or density of development. No land which is submerged or unbuildable under the building or zoning codes shall be included for the purposes of determining plot area, depth or width, or density of development. 
D.  A unity of title declaration shall state unequivocally that the entire property created by the combination of recorded lots, plots, parcels, or portions thereof shall be regarded as unified under one title as an indivisible building site, and that the property shall be henceforth considered as one plot or parcel of land. The sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or devise of a condominium parcel created by a recorded declaration of condominium subjecting the property to the condominium form of ownership shall not be deemed a breach of the declaration of unit of title; however, the entire property shall continue to be regarded as unified and as a single building site for all applicable code purposes. The parties to the declaration shall agree that the declaration of unity of title shall constitute a covenant to run with the land, as provided by law, and shall be binding upon the parties thereto, their heirs, successors and assigns, and all parties claiming under them until such time as the declaration may be released, in writing, by a properly authorized representative of the city. 
E.  The city manager or a designated representative of the city manager is authorized to release a unity of title declaration, in whole or in part, when such declaration is no longer necessary due to the discontinuance or abandonment of the project.

4.  Should the improvements on a property be demolished during the valid timeframe of a development order terminating nonconforming density/intensity pursuant to this section and the property is vacant, the property shall be deemed to be in compliance with these provisions and such termination of nonconforming density/intensity shall be vested and run with the land. 
5.  Any terminated nonconforming units/floor area granted through Section 6-109.B.1. or 2. above shall not be transferred to another site or converted for another use.

(Ord. No. 6526-00, § 1, 6-15-00)  
Section 7-102. - Code enforcement board/special master hearing procedures. 
A.  Notification of violation. Violations of Section 3-1503, Nuisances, may be noticed as "nuisance cases" or "non-nuisance cases" under this Subsection. 
1.  Non-nuisance cases. Upon determining that a violation exists, the code inspector or other enforcement officer shall notify the violator of the violation of this development code or violation of the terms and conditions of any development approval and prescribe a reasonable time to correct the violation. The determination of the appropriate time period shall be based on considerations of fairness, practicality, ease of correction, ability to correct, severity of violation, nature, extent, and probability of danger or damage to the public, and other relevant factors relating to the reasonableness of the time period prescribed. The notice of violation shall be served upon the alleged violator as provided in Section 162.12, F.S. 
2.  Nuisance cases. Upon completion of a field investigation by a code enforcement officer and determination that a nuisance exists under Code of Ordinances Section 3-1503, the property shall be posted with a notice advising of the existence and nature of the violation and requiring compliance no less than five days and no more than ten days after the date of posting and that if the violation is not corrected within the time period prescribed, a hearing will be held before the municipal code enforcement board or special master on a date certain. The code enforcement officer shall additionally attempt to obtain personal service or mail notice to the property owner within the five to ten-day period as contemplated in F.S. § 162.12. 
B.  Notice contents. 
1.  The notice of violation shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
a.  Date of issuance. 
b.  Name of code inspector and division or department issuing the notice. 
c.  Name and address of violator. 
d.  Section number or numbers of the code sections or ordinances violated. 
e.  Brief description of the nature of the violation, including location, date, and time of violation. 
f.  Time within which the violation must be corrected, except in the case of a repeat violation or recurring violation. 
g.  Notice that the violator may be liable for all costs incurred in enforcing the codes and all costs of repairs in certain instances, should the violator be found guilty of the violation. 
2.  In the event a violation continues beyond the time specified in a notice of violation, the code inspector shall notify the municipal code enforcement board or the special master and request a hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be given as provided in Section 162.12 F.S. 
C.  Change of ownership prior to hearing. If the real property upon which the violation is cited is transferred prior to the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
D.  Repeat violation. In the event of a repeat violation, the code inspector shall notify the property owner or the violator and submit the violation to the special master or municipal code enforcement board for a hearing. At the next available meeting after receipt of the notice of violation, the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall conduct a hearing regardless of whether the violation has been corrected, and the notice shall so state. 
E.  Immediate hearings for certain violations. If the code inspector determines that a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall notify the violator and immediately transmit the notice of violation to the special master or the municipal code enforcement board for hearing. 
F.  Conduct of hearing. 
1.  When subpoenas are used, they shall be issued in the name of the special master or municipal code enforcement board and shall be signed by the city clerk. Both the code inspector and the alleged violator, or his designated representative, shall be entitled to request the issuance of subpoenas. The special master or municipal code enforcement board shall have the discretion to refuse to issue subpoenas which relate to witnesses or evidence not located within the city limits, in any situation where the requests for a subpoena would serve to prevent the expeditious enforcement of the codes, ordinances, and regulations within the jurisdiction of the special master or municipal code enforcement board or when the quantity of subpoenas requested is unreasonably burdensome. Persons subpoenaed shall be entitled to a witness fee and mileage compensation as provided for in F.S. § 92.142, as amended. The witness fee, mileage payment and any charge for the service of the subpoena shall be borne by the party requesting the subpoena and shall be paid in advance of the subpoena being issued. The names of persons for whom subpoenas have been issued shall be deemed a matter of public record. 
2.  Presentation of case. Violations of Section 3-1503, Nuisances, may be presented as "nuisance cases" or "non-nuisance cases" under this subsection. 
a.  Non-nuisance cases. Each case before the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall be presented on behalf of the city either by the office of city attorney or by a member of the city's administrative staff. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case. 
b.  Nuisance cases. Each case before the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall be presented on behalf of the city either by the office of city attorney or by a member of the city's administrative staff. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case and shall be entitled to an order as described in Section 7-103.E. If the owner, agent or representative, fails to appear before the board at the designated time to present the appeal, then the owner shall be deemed to have authorized the city to take such remedial action as is necessary to abate the nuisance including, but not limited to, the right to enter the property and take action to remedy the condition without further notice to the owner. 
3.  Cases on an agenda for a particular day shall be heard. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The special master or municipal code enforcement board shall take testimony from the code inspector and the alleged violator, and may take testimony from any other person familiar with the case or having knowledge about the case. The special master or municipal code enforcement board shall not be bound by formal rules of evidence; but, it shall act to ensure fundamental due process. 
4.  If the alleged violator fails to attend the hearing, such failure shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to a hearing and shall be deemed an admission of the violation and the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall impose civil penalties and costs as provided in this article. 
5.  If the special master or municipal code enforcement board finds that the alleged violator did not commit the violation as alleged, the violation shall be dismissed. In such case, the alleged violator shall not be liable for the payment of any civil penalties or reasonable costs of the investigation, prosecution and the administrative hearing. 
6.  At the conclusion of each hearing, the special master or municipal code enforcement board, if the alleged violator is found to have committed the violation as alleged, shall issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record, and conclusions of law, and its order shall prescribe the corrections required and establish a compliance date. The order shall be mailed to the violator along with a notice of the violator's right to rehearing under the provisions of Section 7-102F(9) or the right to appeal under the provisions of Section 7-104. 
7.  A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, shall be binding upon any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance which shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
8.  If a party to the proceedings before the municipal code enforcement board or special master should decide to appeal the decision, a verbatim record of the proceedings may be required, or may be desirable. It shall be the sole responsibility of each party to the proceedings to ensure that a record is made which includes the testimony upon which an appeal may be taken. 
9.  Either the prosecutor or the violator may request a rehearing of the decision of the special master or municipal code enforcement board. A request for rehearing shall be made, in writing, and shall be delivered to the city clerk within ten days of the date that the special master or municipal code enforcement board mails the written order. A request for rehearing shall be based only on the ground that the decision was contrary to the evidence or that the hearing involved an error on a ruling of law which was fundamental to the decision of the special master or municipal code enforcement board. The written request for rehearing shall specify the precise reasons therefor. 
10.  The special master or municipal code enforcement board shall make a determination as to whether or not to rehear the matter. If the special master or municipal code enforcement board determines that a rehearing will be granted, he or the board may: 
a.  Schedule a hearing where the parties will be given the opportunity of presenting evidence or argument limited to the specific reasons for which the rehearing was granted. 
b.  Modify or reverse the prior order, without receiving further evidence, provided that the change is based on a finding that the prior decision resulted from a ruling on a question of law which was an erroneous ruling. 
11.  Until a request for rehearing has been denied or otherwise disposed of, the order of the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall be stayed; and the time for taking an appeal shall not commence until the date upon which the special master or municipal code enforcement board has finally disposed of the request for rehearing by denying the same, or otherwise.

B.  Fines. 
1.  Upon being notified by the code inspector that an order issued by the special master or municipal code enforcement board has not been complied with within the time established in such order or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall order the violator to pay a fine to the city for each day the violation continues past the compliance date established in its order or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. Any fine the special master or municipal code enforcement board imposes pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation or $500.00 per day for a repeat violation. If the municipal code enforcement board finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
2.  A violation of Article 3, Division 3, Adult Use Standards shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or by both a fine and imprisonment, as may be imposed by the county court. 
3.  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the municipal code enforcement board or special master shall consider the following factors: 
1.  The gravity of the violation. 
2.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation. 
3.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
4.  The municipal code enforcement board or special master may impose fines in excess of the limits set forth above. Such fines shall not exceed $1,000.00 per day per violation for a first violation, $5,000.00 per day per violation for a repeat violation, and up to $15,000.00 per violation if the municipal code enforcement board or special master finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature. In addition to such fines, the municipal code enforcement board or special master may impose additional fines to cover all costs incurred by the city in enforcing its codes and all repair costs. In imposing such excess fines, the municipal code enforcement board or special master shall consider: 
a.  The gravity of the violation. 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation and the effectiveness of such actions. 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
d.  Any danger to the public health, safety, and welfare posed by the violation. 
e.  The length of time the violation existed. 
f.  Whether the violation harmed persons legally on the property such as tenants. 
C.  Repairs. If the violation is one that poses a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall notify the city manager, who may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with any fine imposed pursuant to this Section. 
D.  Restoration of landscaping/trees. In addition to the penalties provided in Chapter 1, Section 1.12 of the City of Clearwater's Code of Ordinances, any person who violates any provision of Article 3 Division 12 shall be required, as applicable, to: 
1.  Restore the vegetative buffer to its natural state; or 
2.  Pay to the city a fine equal to the total value of each protected tree or palm illegally removed or damaged. The fine shall be $48.00 per inch of DBH (or diameter of remaining stump), up to $5,000.00 per protected tree or palm where it is found that the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature. The illegal removal of a Specimen tree is deemed to be an irreparable and irreversible violation, subject to a fine of up to $15,000.00. Such sum so collected shall be placed in a fund for the tree bank and shall be expended for the purchase of trees for replacement in public properties within the city; and/or 
3.  Replace illegally removed trees at the owner's expense. Such replacement will be computed on an inch-for-inch basis according to the total inches of DBH (or diameter of remaining stump) of all illegally removed trees; and 
4.  Remove any prohibited trees installed in violation of this or any hazardous trees within 15 days of receipt of notice from the city that such trees are in violation of this Code. In the event such trees are not removed within the 15 day period, the city shall have the trees removed and shall charge the costs of removal to the property owner. 
E.  Entry and repair/nuisances. 
1.  Order allowing entry onto the property to abate and maintain the nuisance. In the event a nuisance is determined by a code inspector to exist and notice has been provided as required by Section 7-102 and the nuisance continues unabated, then the municipal code enforcement board or special master shall enter an order requiring the violator to abate nuisance within five days of the date of the order and declaring that if the nuisance has not been abated by such time then the city has the right to take such remedial action as is necessary to abate and maintain the nuisance including but not limited to the right to enter the property and have such work done on behalf of the owner at the owner's cost, including administrative costs, which shall become a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator as provided in Section 7-103.G. Any order rendered under this subsection shall run with the land once recorded in the Official Records of Pinellas County, Florida. 
2.  Declaration of violation. In the event that a violator abates a nuisance after the date of compliance in the code inspector's notice but before any hearing before the municipal code enforcement board or special master, the code inspector may still bring the case before the municipal code enforcement board or special master for hearing and the municipal code enforcement board or special master shall thereafter enter a declaration of violation finding the violator in violation of the city's codes. Any declaration rendered under this subjection shall run with the land once recorded in the Official Records of Pinellas County, Florida. 
3.  Repeat violation. In the event that a violator commits a repeat violation after either abating a nuisance after entry of an order by the municipal code enforcement board or special master as provided Section 7-103.E.1 or suffering a declaration of violation as provided in Section 7-103.E.2, the code inspector shall notify the property owner or the violator and submit the violation to the special master or municipal code enforcement board for a hearing. At the next available meeting after receipt of the notice of violation, the special master or municipal code enforcement board shall conduct a hearing regardless of whether the violation has been corrected, and the notice shall so state. If it finds that a repeat violation exists or existed, the municipal code enforcement board or special master shall enter an order declaring that the city has the right to take such remedial action as is necessary to abate and maintain the nuisance including but not limited to the right to enter the property and have such work done on behalf of the owner at the owner's cost, including administrative costs, which shall become a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator as provided in Section 7-103.G even if the violation has been corrected, and the notice shall so state. Any order rendered under this subsection shall run with the land once recorded in the Official Records of Pinellas County, Florida. 
F.  Agreements to abate nuisances. In the event the violation constitutes a nuisance under the provisions of Article 3 Division 15, the special master or municipal code enforcement board may enter into an agreement with the violator to take certain measures to abate the nuisance. The agreement shall include the measures to be taken by the person and the time period within which such measure must be completed. If an agreement cannot be reached or an agreement is not followed, the city attorney, the special master or municipal code enforcement board may request the state attorney or the state attorney general to seek judicial relief for abatement of the nuisance pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 60.05 or direct the city attorney to seek judicial relief for abatement of the nuisance. These remedies are in addition to the entry and repair remedy provided for in Section 7-103D. 
G.  Liens. A certified copy of an order imposing a fine and/or the costs of repair may be recorded in the public records of the county, and thereafter such order shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Such lien shall be superior to all other liens, except a lien for taxes. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. 
1.  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. 
2.  A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city commission, and the city commission may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. 
3.  A property owner may petition the city commission to allow the property owner to invest an amount of money equal to one and one-half times the amount of the fine which is due in the revitalization or improvement of the property which was the subject of the violation. Upon presentation of evidence to the city manager that such sum has been properly expended, the lien shall be released by the city commission. 
4.  Three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the municipal code enforcement board may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on such lien in the manner provided by statute for the foreclosure of other municipal liens. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under the state constitution, Article X, § 4. 
5.  In an action to enforce an order or to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorneys fee. The city shall also be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
H.  Civil penalty/citation. 
1.  Prosecution in county court. As an alternative to the special master and the municipal code enforcement board, a code enforcement officer may issue a citation for violation of a provision of the City's Code for prosecution in county court pursuant to Section 1.12 of the City's Code. A code enforcement officer may issue a notice to appear at any hearing conducted by a county court if the officer, based upon personal investigation, has reasonable cause to believe that the person has violated a code or ordinance. A notice to appear means a written order issued by a code enforcement officer in lieu of physical arrest requiring a person accused of violating the law to appear in a designated court or governmental office at a specified date and time. If a person issued a notice to appear under this section refuses to sign such notice, the code enforcement officer has no authority to arrest such person. A person convicted of violating a provision of this development code through the use of this subsection may be ordered to pay a fine, not to exceed $500.00. Prior to issuing a notice to appear, a code enforcement officer shall provide written notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of a code or ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time period shall be no fewer than five days and no more than 30 days. If, upon personal investigation, a code enforcement officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the prescribed time period, a code enforcement officer may issue a notice to appear to the person who has committed the violation. A code enforcement officer is not required to provide the person with a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a notice to appear and may immediately issue a notice to appear if a repeat violation is found, or if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare or that the violator is engaged in violations of an itinerant or transient nature, as defined in Section 8-102, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
2.  Civil citation.

(j)  The time period in which an appeal must be requested and the location where such request may be made. 
(k)  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, or fails to request a special magistrate appeal hearing to contest the citation, that person shall be deemed to have waived their right to contest the citation and that, in such case, an order of the special magistrate may be entered against that person for the amount of the civil citation. 
ii)  Prior to issuing a citation, a code enforcement inspector shall provide written notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of the City Code and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time period shall be no less than five days and no more than 30 days. If, upon personal investigation, a code enforcement inspector finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the given time period, a code enforcement inspector may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation. 
iii)  A code enforcement inspector does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue that citation if a code enforcement inspector has reason to believe that the violation:

(b)  Presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare; or 
(c)  Is irreparable or irreversible; or 
(d)  Is itinerant or transient nature.

Payment of said penalty to the city shall be made either in person or by mail, postmarked on or before, 15 days after receipt of the citation. If the alleged violator elects to pay the applicable penalty set forth on the citation, that person shall be deemed to have admitted the infraction and waived the right to a hearing. 
viii)  If a person fails to pay the penalty within the specified period or fails to timely request a hearing, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right to contest the citation. An order of the special magistrate may be entered against that person for the amount of the civil citation. 
d.  Special magistrate; appointment, powers.

Except as otherwise provided, no person shall erect, construct or modify any building or structure or any part thereof, or cause the same to be done which fails to support adequate radio coverage for City of Clearwater emergency service workers including but not limited to firefighters and police. For purposes of this section, adequate radio coverage shall include all of the following: (1) a minimum signal strength of -95 dBm available in 95 percent of the area of each floor of the building when transmitted from the closest city police or fire communications system site; (2) a minimum signal strength of -95 dBm received at the closest city police or fire communications system site when transmitted from 95 percent of the area of each floor of the building; (3) the frequency range which must be supported shall be 806 MHz to 869 MHz; and (4) a 95 percent reliability factor. The effect on radio coverage is dependent on location (distance from the radio transmitter and receiver and other buildings in the vicinity), height, projected frontal area and construction materials. If engineering studies indicate that there is a potential for reduction in radio system coverage to a level below that considered acceptable for reliable public safety communications, corrective action will be required to assure radio system coverage reliability is retained. At the minimum, a radio signal booster system (800 MHz) will be required. In extreme situation, it may be necessary to install a satellite receiver station. 
The radio system regulations will be applicable at time of new construction and/or at a redevelopment threshold of 50 percent value increase if 50 percent value or more upgrading of system is required. Single-family residences, townhouses as defined in the Florida Building Code - Residential - with four or fewer stories, multiple family structures with four or fewer stories, and/or other buildings with less than 250 horizontal feet in one dimension are exempt. 
The radio signal booster system shall consist of an antenna subsystem (typically mounted on the roof or another exterior structure), a bi-directional amplifier subsystem with a backup power supply mounted in a suitable location on one or more floors of the building and an in-building antenna subsystem. The specifications and design of the system will be subject to approval by the City of Clearwater Radio Communications Shop or its designee and the Development and Neighborhood Services Department prior to the issuance of a building permit.

A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this chapter, provided the variance meets the requirements of Section 51.604, is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 9189-18, § 1, 11-1-18)  
Sec. 51.607. - Considerations for issuance of variances. 
In reviewing requests for variances, the building/flood board of adjustment and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this chapter, and the following: 
(1)  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
(5)  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
(6)  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges; and 
(11)  The necessity of the proposed development to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent use or facility. 
(Ord. No. 9189-18, § 1, 11-1-18)  
Sec. 51.608. - Conditions for issuance of variances. 
Upon consideration of the factors listed in Section 51.607, and the purposes of this chapter, the building/flood board of adjustment and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this chapter or the required elevation standards. The burden shall be on the applicant to provide documentation, sufficient to the satisfaction of the floodplain administrator, to show that the standards and conditions required for the granting of a variance have been met; 
(2)  Determination by the building/flood board of adjustment and appeals that: 
(a)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship. For the purpose of this section, an exceptional hardship can only be caused by a peculiar and unique circumstance related directly to the land and shall not be the result of inconvenience, aesthetic consideration, physical or medical handicap, personal preference, financial considerations, or any after-the-fact circumstance created by the inhabitants of the structure or the present or previous property owners; 
(b)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(c)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court at the applicant's expense, and in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

These Development Standards are organized in five sections as follows. 
A) Regulating Plan 
The regulating plan consists of maps indicating subdistrict limits and street frontage type assignments. Subdistrict standards regulate development intensity, building heights, uses, and parking requirements. 
B) Street Frontage 
Street frontage standards regulate building location and facade treatments, landscaping, pedestrian improvements, and parking treatments along street frontages. 
C) Site Design 
Site design standards regulate the configuration of improvements on sites, project phasing, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, parking and service areas, landscaping, and other features. 
D) Building Design 
Building design standards regulate the treatment of front facades, building entries, and other features related to the architectural design of buildings. 
E) Flexibility 
The flexibility section provides process and standards for the approval of flexibility in the application of design standards. 
(Ord. No. 8988-17, § 21, 2-2-17)  
Section B-104. - Applicability of design standards. 
A) General 
The US 19 District street frontage, site design, and building design standards ("Design Standards") are intended to ensure that new buildings and significant renovations and additions are designed in accordance with the vision described in the US 19 Corridor Redevelopment Plan, while allowing for incremental improvements to existing buildings and sites. Provisions addressing flexibility in the application of Design Standards are included in Division 7. 
B) Conformity of Existing Structures 
Existing structures within the US 19 District, including buildings and parking, shall not be considered nonconforming under Section 6-102. 
C) Exemptions 
The following types of development are exempt from all or a portion of the Design Standards as follows. 
1.  Structures Damaged by Force Majeure. Not withstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, if a lawfully constructed structure is damaged or destroyed by fire, casualty or act of God, the owner of record on the date of the event may repair or rebuild said structure on the same building site and with the same building footprint by right. To qualify, the structure must have been legally permitted to have been built under this or other Codes, or have legally existed as a non-conforming structure prior to the causative event. The structure shall not be added to or altered in any way, except to remedy the effects of such damage or destruction, unless such additions or alterations cause the structure to conform more closely with the provisions of this Code. Permits for repair or replacement of such structures must be obtained within one year of the causative event. 
2.  Restricted Access Sites. Developments for which public access is prohibited due to health, safety, public security, and welfare reasons are exempt from these Design Standards. 
3.  Detached Dwellings. Detached dwellings lawfully existing on the date of adoption of these Development Standards may continue to be repaired, remodeled and expanded consistent with the provisions set forth in Article 2, Division 2, provided that any enlargement or alteration to the structure does not create any additional dwelling units. New accessory structures may be constructed consistent with Section 3-201. No lot of record upon which a detached dwelling existed on the date of adoption of these Development Standards may be expanded or reduced in size. 
4.  Mobile Homes and Mobile Home Parks. Mobile homes and mobile home parks lawfully existing on the date of adoption of these Development Standards may continue to be repaired, remodeled and/or replaced consistent with the provisions set forth in Article 2, Division 6, provided that any modifications do not create any additional dwelling units. New accessory structures may be constructed consistent with Section 3-201. No lot of record upon which a mobile home or mobile home park existed on the date of adoption of these Development Standards may be expanded or reduced in size. 
5.  Change of Use. Projects involving only a change in use are exempt from the Design Standards. 
6.  Improvement, Remodel, or Reconstruction. Building improvement and remodel projects, including reconstruction of buildings in the general location or footprint of buildings being replaced, with up to 5 percent additional gross floor area, shall be exempt from the Design Standards as follows. 
a.  Building improvement, remodel, or reconstruction projects valued at less than 25 percent of the total assessed building value as reflected in the Property Appraiser's current records at the time of application are exempt from the Design Standards. 
b.  Building improvement, remodel, or reconstruction projects valued at 25 percent or more of the total assessed building value as reflected in the Property Appraiser's current records at the time of application, are exempt from all but Sections B-503.C, B-504.A.1, B-504.C, and B-505.A of the Design Standards. The provisions of Sections B-503.C, B-504.A.1, B-504.C, and B-505.A of the Design Standards shall apply to the area of the site within reasonable proximity to the improved, remodeled, or reconstructed area of the building. 
7.  Internal Buildings and Additions. New buildings or additions to existing buildings located 200 feet minimum from the front property line shall be exempt from the street frontage standards in Division 4 and Sections B-502, B-503.A, B-503.B, and B-604.A. The location of new buildings or additions to existing buildings shall allow for future development compliant with all setback requirements. 
8.  Parking and Landscaping. The following Community Development Code sections shall not apply: 3-1202.A.2, 3-1202.A.3, 3-1401.B.2 and 3-1401.B.3.

DIVISION 2. - REGULATING PLAN 
 
Section B-201. - General. 
Development within the US 19 District is regulated by subdistrict and street frontage type as shown in Figure 1. Regulating Plan and described below. 
(Ord. No. 8988-17, § 21, 2-2-17)  
Section B-202. - Subdistricts. 
Standards and regulations for properties within the US 19 District apply to properties falling within one of three Subdistricts illustrated in Figure 1. Regulating Plan. 
A) Regional Center Subdistrict 
The Regional Center Subdistrict is applied to areas along US 19 planned to develop with a more urban character defined by taller, mixed use buildings aligned along streets. Standards are designed to create pedestrian-friendly streets and building frontages, and better connections among destinations. 
B) Neighborhood Center Subdistrict 
The Neighborhood Center Subdistrict is applied to areas along US 19 planned to serve as local shopping and employment destinations. Standards are designed to create more pedestrian-friendly streets and building frontages, and better connections among destinations. 
C) Corridor Subdistrict 
The Corridor Subdistrict is applied to areas along US 19 without direct access to interchanges. In these areas, a wide range of employment-intensive uses is favored over small-scale retail uses. Standards are designed to allow flexibility in site configurations and consistency in front landscape improvements. 
(Ord. No. 8988-17, § 21, 2-2-17)  
Section B-203. - Street frontage types. 
A) Street Frontage Types on Regulating Plan 
Select requirements in these Development Standards apply to properties along one of five street frontage types shown in Figure 1. Regulating Plan. These are further described in Division 4, where Street Frontage Type A is considered the most pedestrian- and transit-supportive and Street Frontage Type E is considered the least pedestrian- and transit-supportive. 
B) Street Frontage Types Assignment 
1.  Along new primary drives as defined in Section B-502.B and Table 5. Locational and Design Standards for New Drives, Street Frontage Type A is required.

b.  Side Setbacks ( B ): 10 feet minimum or 0 feet if abutting adjacent building with blank side wall 
c.  Rear Setbacks ( C ): 10 feet minimum 
2.  Front setbacks may be reduced to 5 feet in locations where adjacent rights-of-way are improved with a 10-foot minimum wide landscape area adjacent to the street and a 10-foot minimum wide pedestrian area adjacent to building frontages. For the purpose of this section, the landscape area adjacent to the street shall include landscape material equivalent to what is required for front buffer areas in Article 3, Division 12 with the exception that the width shall be as set forth above. 
3.  Front setbacks may be increased by 10 feet maximum extending 40 feet maximum along the front facade for projects with front courtyards or publicly-accessible front entry plazas. 
4.  To promote continuity of building frontages along front setbacks, the space between individual buildings shall not exceed 100 feet ( D ). 
C) Pedestrian and Landscape Improvements 
1.  The area along front building facades shall be improved with a 10-foot minimum wide pedestrian area ( E ). 
2.  Walkway connections shall be provided between public sidewalks and pedestrian areas along building facades. Such connections shall be 6 feet wide minimum and spaced 100 feet apart maximum. 
3.  For areas where front setbacks are not reduced or eliminated, the area along the property line within the front setback shall be improved with a 5-foot minimum wide landscape area ( F ). 
D) Parking and Vehicular Circulation 
1.  Parking, vehicular circulation, and other vehicular use areas are prohibited between buildings and streets along front setbacks. 
2.  Surface parking to the side of buildings along streets shall be set back 5 feet behind front building facades and screened from view with a low (24 to 36 inches) opaque hedge or wall. 
3.  Structured parking, whether freestanding or attached to a building, shall be located to the rear of buildings.

DIVISION 4. - FRONTAGE STANDARDS 
 
Section C-401. - Relationship between street types and frontage standards. 
Table 3. Frontages and Street Types shows which development standards in this division apply by the street types shown in Figure 2. Regulating PlanStreet Types and Key Corners. Multiple frontages can apply to a single project along a street type. 
(Ord. No. 9149-18, § 8, 8-2-18)  
Section C-402. - Properties with multiple street frontages. 
A.  Definition of Primary and Secondary Street Frontages. For project sites with multiple street frontages, including corner sites, a primary street frontage shall be defined. The primary street frontage shall be defined as the street frontage with the highest level of designated street type or the highest level of existing and planned pedestrian activity as defined in the Clearwater Downtown Redevelopment Plan. 
B.  Definition of Frontages for Corner Sites. For corner sites where the street type is the same on two frontages, the primary street frontage shall be defined as the frontage to which the majority of buildings on adjacent sites are oriented and addressed. In locations where the orientation of buildings on adjacent sites is unclear, the primary street frontage shall be defined as the frontage on which the building is addressed. As provided in Division 8. Flexibility, a limited amount of flexibility in meeting requirements for frontages defined as secondary street frontages may be approved. 
C.  Application of Setbacks on Through Lots. For project sites with frontage on two parallel streets, one of which is a Service Street Type, the side setbacks applicable to the primary street frontage shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 9149-18, § 8, 8-2-18)  
Section C-403. - Key corner requirements. 
For locations identified as Key Corners on Figure 2. Regulating PlanStreet Types and Key Corners, ground floor building space within 100 feet of the corner and to a depth of 20 feet minimum from the front façade (as measured along front property lines) shall be occupied only by active uses including retail sales and services, restaurants, bars, brewpubs, microbreweries, nightclubs, and/or lobbies to upper story building space. For buildings occupied only by residential uses, ground floor amenity areas such as offices, lobbies, or fitness centers shall count toward meeting this requirement only if the ground floor façade meets the requirements applicable to Storefront 1 or Storefront 2 frontages. Ground floor building space designed for open air dining or cafe use may count towards this requirement. Flexibility in meeting façade transparency requirements in these locations shall not be permitted. Key corner requirements shall not apply to publicly owned park and plaza space.

DIVISION 7. - SIGN STANDARDS 
 
Section C-701. - Intent and purpose. 
The intent and purpose of this section is to establish specific standards for the Downtown District that implement Section 3-1801. General Principles, Section 3-1802, Purpose of the Sign Regulations as well as the following: 
A.  Establish reasonable and improved sign standards for Downtown that encourages the use of a hierarchy of signs appropriately sized for a well-organized visual Downtown environment. 
B.  Ensure that signs are complementary to the architectural design of Downtown. 
C.  Ensure that signage is pedestrian oriented and appropriately scaled for the Downtown environment. 
D.  Facilitate creative and innovative approaches to signs consistent with the intent and purpose of Section C-101 of the Downtown District. 
E.  Encourage uniquely designed signs that exhibit a high degree of thoughtfulness, imagination and inventiveness. 
(Ord. No. 9217-19, § 6, 1-17-19)  
Section C-702. - Applicability. 
No sign may be erected, or may thereafter be altered or otherwise modified, in the Downtown District except in accordance with the requirements of this section. Requirements not specifically addressed in Appendix C, Division 7 are subject to the signage requirements set forth in Article 3, Division 18, Signs and Article 4, Division 10, Sign Permit. If there are any conflicts between these regulations and those in Article 3, Division 18, these standards shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 9217-19, § 6, 1-17-19)  
Section C-703. - General standards. 
A.  Exempt and prohibited sign provisions set forth in Sections 3-1803 and 3-1804 shall apply in the Downtown District. 
B.  General provisions for signs set forth in Section 3-1805 shall apply unless otherwise superseded by regulations contained in this Appendix C, Division 7. 
C.  Temporary sign provisions set forth in Section 3-1806 shall apply in the Downtown District. 
D.  Properties in the Downtown District shall be eligible for the Comprehensive Sign Program as set forth in Section 3-1808. 
(Ord. No. 9217-19, § 6, 1-17-19)  
Section C-704. - General principles for sign planning and design standards. 
Vibrant, well designed signs promote business activity, provide visual interest and create an interesting environment that attracts people. To ensure signage has a positive impact consistent with the vision and guiding principles established in the Clearwater Downtown Redevelopment Plan, the following general principles and design standards shall apply in addition to those set forth in Section C-705, below. 
A.  Hierarchy of Signs. Signs are the graphic representation of a business in the built environment, therefore, they should be designed in a concise manner to deliver essential information quickly, efficiently and at the point where it is needed. If more than one sign is erected on a single building/business facade a clear hierarchy should be used to ensure the important content is the most prominent. All signs shall be scaled in a clear hierarchy and shall address different viewer orientations and audiences. The most important information on a sign should be the most prominent and emphasized component of the sign. The more important the information, the higher its visibility should be with regard to sign size and placement. Layering information helps customers obtain the information they need while ensuring that every sign has an objective. Larger signs, which are intended to be viewed from farther distances should be strategically placed on the building facade over storefronts and entrances. Smaller signs can provide information at a smaller scale and be intended for view from shorter distances at the pedestrian level. 
 
Figure 33. Hierarchy of Signs Example

DIVISION 8. - FLEXIBILITY 
 
Section C-801. - General. 
Flexibility in the application of development standards in Appendix C, Divisions 3, 4, 5, and 6 may be approved by the Community Development Coordinator or Community Development Board as provided below. Where flexibility is allowed, the level of flexibility permitted shall be the minimum extent required to address flexibility standards and requirements. 
(Ord. No. 9149-18, § 8, 8-2-18)  
Section C-802. - Process. 
Authority to grant flexibility shall follow the approval levels indicated by use in Table 1. Use and Off-Street Parking and shall be administered consistent with the development review procedures in Article 4 of this Development Code. The Community Development Coordinator shall have authority to grant flexibility for Level One approvals and the Community Development Board shall have authority to grant flexibility for Level Two approvals. Where flexibility is being requested for a Level One Minimum Standard Development use, the request shall be processed as a Level One Flexible Standard Development. 
(Ord. No. 9149-18, § 8, 8-2-18)  
Section C-803. - Flexibility provisions. 
Flexibility may be approved subject to the standards below. 
A.  Frontage StandardsProperties with Multiple Street Frontages. Flexibility in the orientation of front building façades for attached and detached dwellings may be approved to allow for frontage orientation consistent with typical frontage orientation on surrounding blocks. 
B.  Frontage StandardsBuilding Setbacks. 
1.  Front building setbacks greater than the maximums allowed may be approved for projects with a publicly-accessible outdoor open space or site constraints such as shape irregularities and/or the presence of natural features, existing utilities, utility easements, or access easements making meeting setback requirements impractical or infeasible. 
2.  Flexibility in the application of front setback requirements may be approved to allow new development setbacks compatible with the traditional character of development on adjacent sites and block frontages. 
3.  Flexibility in the application of front setback requirements to provide 10-foot minimum sidewalk widths may be approved to allow new development setbacks compatible with the traditional character of development on adjacent sites and block frontages. 
4.  Side and rear setbacks less than the minimum allowed may be approved for projects to allow for innovative site designs that advance the goals and objectives for the Clearwater Downtown Redevelopment Plan. 
5.  The maximum spacing between individual buildings along Storefront 1 and Urban Residential 1 Street Frontages may be increased or waived for projects with one or more of the following characteristics. 
a.  The proposed site configuration is designed to incorporate natural features such as a stand of mature trees, body of water, wetland or other similar feature. 
b.  Placement of existing buildings and/or site access and circulation constraints make it infeasible to meet the standard. 
c.  The placement of publicly-accessible outdoor plaza spaces to the side of the building results in increased spacing to accommodate the plaza. 
Where flexibility in the standard is allowed, enhanced landscaping and the use of low walls along street frontages to screen parking and define the edge of pedestrian walkways shall be required. 
C.  Frontage StandardsFences and Walls Along Street Frontages. Flexibility in the prohibition of fences and walls in front of buildings along Street Types D, E, and F may be approved where the placement of a fence or wall in front of the building does not negatively affect the project's pedestrian orientation or is found to be compatible with front setback conditions on abutting and nearby properties. Where flexibility is approved, fence or wall height shall be 6 feet maximum, and any portion above three feet in height shall be at least 50 percent open (i.e., picket style). 
D.  Frontage StandardsFront Building Façades and Entries. 
1.  For buildings with multiple street frontages, required glazing below 4 feet along secondary street frontages may be exempt from the daylight reduction (tinting) standard. No reflective or mirrored coating or treatments are permitted. These flexibility provisions are illustrated in Figure 33. Frontage Design Flexibility. 
2.  Flexibility in locating building entries on secondary street frontages may be approved as long as façades on primary and secondary street frontages are designed to meet applicable standards and the primary building entry is located on the primary street frontage or corner. 
3.  Flexibility in the application of finished floor elevation standards for residential buildings may be approved to accommodate projects on sloping sites or projects with innovative building types. 
E.  Frontage StandardsParking. 
1.  Flexibility in the application of landscape and wall requirements to screen surface parking, service areas, and structured parking, may be approved where alternative design treatments result in all of the following. 
a.  The screening of vehicles from view along public sidewalks. 
b.  The physical separation of pedestrian use and vehicular use areas. 
c.  The creation of safe, comfortable, and quality pedestrian environments along pedestrian walkways and public sidewalks. 
Figure 33. Frontage Design Flexibility
 
2.  Flexibility to allow surface or ground floor parking and other vehicular use areas, including vehicular loading/unloading areas and passenger drop off areas, may be approved along secondary street frontages. If approved, such areas shall be primary street frontages 20 feet minimum, and include architectural and landscape screening and other treatments that contribute to the creation of safe and comfortable pedestrian environments along pedestrian walkways and public sidewalks. Curb cuts from secondary street frontage to access such locations shall be minimized. 
3.  Flexibility to allow single width private driveways located in side setbacks no closer than 2 feet from side lot lines may be approved along Street Type F for projects where the adjacent property's driveway is not located within the side setback on the shared property line for which the flexibility is required. 
F.  Frontage StandardsAttached and Detached Dwellings. Flexibility in meeting frontage requirements for attached or detached dwelling projects may be approved if a project utilizes innovative building types or styles such as bungalow court configurations, carriage houses, or the like. Flexibility shall only be approved along Street Types E and F. 
G.  Site Design StandardsDevelopment Pattern. Flexibility in the application of requirements for development blocks and lots, new private drives, and new private service drives may be approved for projects on sites where the applicant demonstrates that site size, dimension, shape, or presence of constraints such as natural areas, utilities or utility easements, or other existing features make meeting these requirements infeasible. 
H.  Building Design StandardsFaçade Design and Articulation. Flexibility in meeting the façade design and articulation standards may be approved where the alternative design treatment provides a varied and interesting design and the alternative treatment is integral to the building's design and results in façades of equal or better quality than the standards would produce. 
I.  Building Design StandardsGlass Treatments. Flexibility in applying glass treatment standards may be permitted for buildings that incorporate stained or art glass as an integral part of the building design and still provide for the minimum level of glazing as required under Appendix C, Division 4. 
J.  General Flexibility Provisions. Flexibility in the application of development standards for places of worship, certain indoor recreation uses such as auditoria, museums, and stadiums, and public utilities uses may be approved. Buildings and improvements shall include architectural and landscape screening and other treatments that contribute to the creation of safe and comfortable pedestrian environments along pedestrian walkways and public sidewalks. 
K.  Character District StandardsResidential Use Restrictions. Flexibility in the application of residential use restrictions for projects along Street Type D or limited segments of frontage designated Street Type E may be approved to permit office use where the applicant demonstrates that the hours of operation, parking demand, and other use related impacts are minimized, primary entries to individual ground floor units are provided, and the office use and architectural character are consistent with the character of the surrounding area. Flexibility on frontage designated Street Type E shall only be permitted on: Drew Street between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Missouri Avenue; Grove Street between Martin Luther King. Jr. Avenue and Missouri Avenue; and on Garden Avenue north of Seminole Street.

DIVISION 9. - ADMINISTRATION 
 
Section C-901. - Site plan approvals. 
The final decision-making authority for site plans is either the Community Development Coordinator for Level One approvals or the Community Development Board for Level Two approvals, as specified in Article 4. The level of approval required varies by use and character district as specified in Table 1. Use and Off-Street Parking, which identifies whether a use can be approved as a Building Construction Permit (Level 1 Minimum Standard), or if Community Development Coordinator (Level 1 Flexible Standard Development) or Community Development Board (Level 2 Flexible Development) approval is required. Projects requesting flexibility in the application of development standards shall follow the process established in Appendix C, Section C-802. 
(Ord. No. 9149-18, § 8, 8-2-18)  
Section C-902. - Amending street types and key corners. 
Changing a designated street type or key corner designation requires an amendment to Figure 2. Regulating PlanStreet Types and Key Corners, which is a text amendment. Text amendments will be processed in accordance with Section 4-601. A request to amend a street type or key corner designation must also include an application for development approval. 
(Ord. No. 9149-18, § 8, 8-2-18)  
Section C-903. - Regulating plan adjustments. 
A.  Minor Street Type Adjustments. The street type designation along front property lines may be adjusted up to 200 feet by the Community Development Coordinator through a Level 1 Flexible Standard Development application, provided that such adjustments do not negatively affect the project's pedestrian- and transit-orientation, and advance the goals and objectives of the Clearwater Downtown Redevelopment Plan. 
B.  Street Type on Existing or New Public Streets. Upon approval of a development project which includes new public streets or existing public streets where a street type was not previously depicted in Figure 2. Regulating PlanStreet Types and Key Corners, the Community Development Coordinator will make an administrative adjustment to Figure 2. Regulating PlanStreet Types and Key Corners to reflect the approved street type(s).
