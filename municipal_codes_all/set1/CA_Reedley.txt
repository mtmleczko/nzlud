A. The written objections to the plan are hereby overruled and the written report presented to the city council on this date is hereby adopted and approved
as the city council's response to its findings, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 33364;
B. The project area is a predominately urbanized area which is a blighted area, the redevelopment of which is necessary to effectuate the public purposes
declared in the community redevelopment law of the state of California2 and specifically that the project area is characterized by the existence of
buildings and structures, used or intended to be used for living, commercial, industrial or other purposes, or any combination of such uses, which are

1. Defective design and character of physical construction;
2. Faulty interior arrangement and exterior spacing;
3. High density of population and overcrowding;
4. Inadequate provision for ventilation, light, sanitation, open spaces and recreation facilities;
5. Age, obsolescence, deterioration, dilapidation, mixed character or shifting of uses;
and is further characterized by properties which suffer from economic dislocation, deterioration or disuse because of one or more of the following
factors which cause a reduction of, or lack of, proper utilization of the area to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical, social or economic
burden on the community which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by private enterprise acting alone:
a. The subdividing and sale of lots of irregular form and shape and inadequate size for proper usefulness and development;
b. The laying out of lots in disregard of the contours and other topography or physical characteristics of the ground and surrounding conditions;
c. The existence of inadequate public improvements, public facilities, open spaces and utilities which cannot be remedied by private or governmental
action without redevelopment;
d. The prevalence of depreciated values, impaired investments and social and economic maladjustment;
C. The redevelopment plan will redevelop the project area in conformity with the community redevelopment law of the state of California in the interests of
the public peace, health, safety and welfare;
D. The adoption and carrying out of the redevelopment plan is economically sound and feasible;

6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 18/391
F. The carrying out of the redevelopment plan will promote the public peace, health, safety and welfare of the city and will effectuate the purposes and
policies of the community redevelopment law of the state of California;
G. The condemnation of real property is necessary to the execution of the redevelopment plan and adequate provisions have been made for payment for
property to be acquired as provided;
H. The agency3 has a feasible method or plan for the relocation of families and persons to be temporarily or permanently displaced from housing facilities
in the project area;
I. There are or are being provided in the project area or in other areas not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial
facilities and at rents or prices within the financial means of the families and persons displaced from the project area, if any, decent, safe and sanitary
dwellings equal in number to the number of and available to such displaced families and persons and reasonably accessible to their places of
employment;
J. Inclusion within the project area of any lands, buildings or improvements which are not detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare is necessary for
the effective redevelopment of the area of which they are a part; and any such area included is necessary for effective redevelopment of the project
area and is not included for the purpose of obtaining the allocation of tax increment revenues from such area, pursuant to Health and Safety Code
section 33670, without other substantial justification for its inclusion;
K. The elimination of blight and redevelopment of the project area cannot be reasonably expected to be accomplished by private enterprise acting alone
without the aid and assistance of the agency; and
L. The provision of low and moderate income housing outside the project area will be of benefit to the project. (Ord. 759, 7-16-1991)
1-11-5: OFFICIAL ACTION BY CITY COUNCIL:
In order to implement and facilitate the effectuation of the redevelopment plan hereby approved and adopted, it is found and determined that certain official
actions must be taken by the city council with reference, among other things, to changes in zoning, the vacating and removal of the streets, alleys and
other public ways, the establishment of new street patterns and location and relocation of sewer and water mains and other public facilities and other
public action and, accordingly, the city council hereby:
A. Declares its intention to undertake and complete any proceedings necessary to be carried out by the city under the provisions of the redevelopment
plan; and
B. Requests of the various officials, departments, boards, commissions and agencies of the city having administrative responsibilities with respect to the
project likewise to cooperate to such end and to exercise their respective functions and powers in a manner consistent with the redevelopment plan.
(Ord. 759, 7-16-1991)
1-11-6: HOUSING FACILITIES, AVAILABILITY ASSURED:
The city council is satisfied that permanent housing facilities will be available within three (3) years from the time occupants of the project area are
displaced, if any, and that pending the development of such facilities there will be available to such displaced occupants adequate temporary housing
facilities at rents comparable to those in the city at the time of their displacement. No persons or families of low and moderate income shall be displaced
from residences unless and until there is a suitable housing unit available and ready for occupancy by such displaced person or family at rents comparable
to those at the time of their displacement. Such housing units shall be suitable to the needs of such displaced persons or families and must be decent,
safe, sanitary and otherwise standard dwellings. The agency shall not displace such person or family until such housing units are available and ready for
occupancy. (Ord. 759, 7-16-1991)
1-11-7: TAX INCREMENT FINANCING:
The city council is convinced that the effect of tax increment financing, as provided for in the Reedley redevelopment plan, will not cause a severe financial
burden or detriment to any taxing agency deriving revenues from the project area. (Ord. 759, 7-16-1991)
1-11-8: VALIDITY OF CHAPTER AND/OR PLAN:
If any part of this chapter or the redevelopment plan which it approves is held to be invalid for any reason, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portion of this chapter or of the redevelopment plan, and the city council hereby declares that it would have passed the remainder of this chapter

Chapter 12
ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS
1-12-1: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
A. The city council finds and declares that there is a need for an alternative method of enforcement for violations of this code and that an appropriate
method of enforcement is an administrative citation program.
B. The council additionally finds that it is in the public's interest to streamline enforcement of violations of city laws by providing for administrative citations.
This is so because the issuance of an administrative citation provides for a quick resolution of uncontested violations, but continues to give persons
who have been issued citations a hearing before a neutral party.
C. Pursuant to article XI, section 7, of the California Constitution, the city has the authority to make and enforce within its jurisdictional limits all laws for the
public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Reedley which are not in conflict with general state laws. In addition, California Government Code
section 36901 specifically provides that the city may impose civil fines, penalties and forfeitures, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00),
for violations of city ordinances. Further, California Government Code section 53069.4 expressly authorizes the city to establish an administrative
citation program for violations of city ordinances.
D. The council further finds that certain violations of this code may be of such a nature, or the administrative citation may be ineffective in ensuring
compliance with this code, that existing enforcement mechanisms may have to be utilized. These methods include, but are not necessarily limited to,
the use of a criminal citation or complaint, abatement, or civil injunction. Therefore, nothing in this chapter is intended to preclude the city's use of
alternative code enforcement methods. (Ord. 2013-003, 6-25-2013)

determine that the owner of the business is the responsible party.
B. Except as provided for in subsection D of this section, prior to issuing an administrative citation to a responsible party, the enforcement officer shall
provide written notice to the responsible party of the violation. That notice need not be in any particular form, but shall, at a minimum:
1. Describe the nature of the code violation, including identifying the code section(s) violated;
2. Identify what action is necessary to correct the violation;
3. Provide the responsible party with not less than seven (7) calendar days to correct the violation, unless: a) a lesser time is specified elsewhere in this
code for correcting the violation; or b) the enforcement officer determines that a lesser time is necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare
of the citizens of the city; and
4. Explain the consequences of a failure to correct the violation.
C. The notice required in subsection B of this section may be sent to the responsible party by first class mail, certified mail, overnight mail, facsimile, email,
hand delivery, or by any other method reasonably likely to provide notice to the responsible party, by sending the notice to the responsible party's
business address, principal place of business address, residence address, or other address known to the enforcement officer by reliable information.
The time within which to correct the violation shall run from the date the notice is sent.
D. The notice required by subsection B of this section may be dispensed with for the following violations: 1) violations that create an immediate danger to
the public health, safety and welfare, as determined by the enforcement officer, and for which immediate correction is required; 2) noncontinuing
violations for which it is not possible or practical to provide prior notice and an opportunity to correct; and 3) repeat or chronic violations where either
formal or informal notice of the violation, and previous reasonable opportunities to correct, have been provided. Examples of noncontinuing violations

the enforcement officer may issue an administrative citation to the responsible party by any one of the following methods:
1. The enforcement officer may attempt to locate the responsible party at the location of the violation during regular business hours if a business, or at
any reasonable time if not a business. If the enforcement officer is able to locate the responsible party, the enforcement officer shall either leave the
citation with the responsible party, securely post the citation on the front door of the residence or business, or mail the citation in accordance with
subsection E4 of this section.
2. For property related violations, including planning, zoning and building violations, the enforcement officer may securely post the citation in a
conspicuous place on the property and mail a copy of the citation to the responsible party by first class mail within five (5) days of posting to the
responsible party's business address, principal place of business address, residence address, or other address known to the enforcement officer by
reliable information.

4. The enforcement officer may mail the citation to the responsible party by certified and first class mail to the responsible party's business address,
principal place of business address, residence address, or other address known to the enforcement officer by reliable information.
The failure of any person to receive an administrative citation shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. Notice shall be
effective on the date the citation is received if personally served, on the date the citation was posted if posted, or on the date mailed if sent by
certified mail.
F. The notice provided pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be sufficient notice for subsequent violations of the same code section occurring within
twelve (12) months of the notice even if the violation occurs at a different location, and the enforcement officer may proceed directly to an
administrative citation on future violations of the same code section occurring within twelve (12) months of the notice even if the violation occurs at a

3-1-2: TAX RATES EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003:
Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, effective on and after one minute past twelve o'clock (12:01) A.M., July 1, 2003, the sales and use
taxes imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be reduced from their current rate of nine hundred fifty five one-thousandths of one percent (0.955%)
to a new rate of nine hundred fifty one-thousandths of one percent (0.950%). The purpose of this change of rate is to allow the county to receive five onethousandths
of one percent (0.005%) of the sales and use taxes which would otherwise be collected by the city, all in accordance with that certain
"Memorandum Of Understanding Between The County Of Fresno, The City Of Reedley And The Reedley Redevelopment Agency1" executed in
accordance with authorization of their respective governing bodies, the city and agency having authorized execution on March 26, 1991. If for any reason
the purposes of this change of rate are not accomplished, then this section shall cease to be of any force or effect; provided, notice of change in rate shall
be given as required by law. (Ord. 2003-04, 4-22-2003)

division 2;

those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Revenue and Taxation Code part 1.5 of division 2;
C. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the state board
of equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the state board of equalization in administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes;
D. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of
Revenue and Taxation Code part 1.5 of division 2, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of
record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 515, 10-16-1973)
3-1-5: CONTRACT WITH STATE:
Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the state board of equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of
this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if the city shall not have contracted with the state board of equalization prior to the operative date, it shall
nevertheless so contract, and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract
rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this chapter. (Ord. 515, 10-16-1973)
3-1-6: SALES TAX:
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in section 3-1-2 of this

10-16-1973)
3-1-7: PLACE OF SALE:
For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is
delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out of state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out of state destination. The gross receipts from
such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.
ln the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales
are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the state board of equalization. (Ord. 515, 10-16-

controller, the state treasurer, the state board of control, the state board of equalization, the state treasury or the constitution of the state of California; the
substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any agency thereof, rather than
by or against the state board of equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not
be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the result
of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal
property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under
the provisions of Revenue and Taxation Code part 1 of division 2, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of
tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provisions of that code; the substitution shall not be made in
Revenue and Taxation Code sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828; and the substitution shall not be

phrase in section 6203. (Ord. 515, 10-16-1973)

Chapter 7
UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
3-7-1: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known as the UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX ORDINANCE of the city. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows:
CITY COUNCIL: The city council of the city of Reedley.
HOTEL: "Hotel" and "motel" as those terms are defined in section 10-2-3 of this code; recreational vehicle campground; inn; tourist home or house; and
any other similar structure or structures or portion or portions thereof; provided, however, that for the purposes of this chapter "hotel" as above defined
shall apply only to buildings or structures with forty (40) or more dwelling units, to a group or groups of buildings or structures under common ownership or
control with forty (40) or more dwelling units, and to recreational vehicle campgrounds with accommodations for sixty (60) or more recreational vehicles, as
defined in section 10-2-3 of this chapter.
OCCUPANCY: The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping
purposes.
OPERATOR: The person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent
shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent, however, shall be considered to be compliance by both.
PERSON: Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or
combination acting as a unit.
RENT: The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money,
goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, property and services of any kind or nature without any deductions therefrom whatsoever.
TAX ADMINISTRATOR: The city manager or his designee.
TRANSIENT: Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, timeshare
arrangement or ownership or agreement (but not timeshare estate ownership), or other agreement of whatever nature, for a period of thirty (30)
consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a
transient if his actual total period of occupancy does not exceed thirty (30) days. Unless days of occupancy or entitlement to occupancy by one person are
consecutive without any break, then prior or subsequent periods of such occupancy or entitlement to occupancy shall not be counted when determining
whether a period exceeds that stated thirty (30) calendar days. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-3: TAX IMPOSED:
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eight percent (8%) of the rent charged by
the operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient to the city, which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the
city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax
shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is
not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-4: EXEMPTIONS:
No tax shall be imposed upon:
A. Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided for in this chapter;
B. Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business; or
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 51/391
C. Any officer or employee of a foreign government, which officer or employee is exempt by reason of express provisions of federal law or international
treaty. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time the rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form
prescribed by the tax administrator. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-5: OPERATOR'S DUTIES:
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every
transient. The amount of the tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment
from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof, will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-6: REGISTRATION:
Prior to commencing business, each operator of any hotel renting an occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain
from him a transient occupancy registration certificate which shall at all times be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate, among
other things, shall set forth the following information:
A. The name of the registered operator;
B. The name and address of the hotel;
C. The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
D. A statement as follows:
This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform
transient occupancy tax law by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and
remitting such tax to the tax administrator. This certificate shall not authorize any person to conduct any lawful business or to conduct any lawful
business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a
permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit and is not transferable to a different
operator.
(Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-7: REPORTS AND REMITTANCES:
The tax imposed by section 3-7-3 of this chapter shall:
A. Be due to the tax administrator at the time it is collected by the operator; and
B. Become delinquent and subject to penalties if not received by the tax administrator on or before the last working day of the month following the close of
each calendar quarter.
Each operator, on or before the last working day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, shall file a return with the tax administrator
on the forms provided by him of the total rents charged or chargeable as provided in section 3-7-3 of this chapter, whether or not received, including
any rentals charged for occupancies exempt under the provisions of section 3-7-4 of this chapter, and the amount of tax collected for transient
occupancies. Each such return shall contain a declaration under penalty of perjury, executed by the operator or his authorized agent, that to the best of
the signer's knowledge, the statements in the return are true, correct and complete. Amounts claimed on the return as exempt from the tax pursuant to
sections 3-7-4 and 3-7-13 of this chapter shall be fully itemized and explained on the return or supporting schedule. In determining the amount of
taxable receipts on the tax return, "rent", as defined in section 3-7-2 of this chapter, may not be reduced by any business expense including, but not
limited to, the amount of service charges deducted by credit card companies or commissions paid to travel agencies. At the time the return is filed, the
tax fixed at the prevailing transient occupancy tax rate for the amount of rentals charged or chargeable, which are not exempt from tax pursuant to
sections 3-7-4 and 3-7-13 of this chapter, shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish other reporting periods and
may require a cash deposit or bond or a separate trust fund bank account for any permit holder if the tax administrator deems it necessary in order to
ensure the collection of the tax, and he may require further information on the return. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be
held in trust for the account of the city until remittance thereof is made to the tax administrator as provided in this section. (Ord. 94-015, 6-28-1994)
3-7-8: PENALTIES AND INTEREST:
A. Original Delinquencies: Any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty
in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the tax, in addition to the amount of the tax.
B. Continued Delinquencies: Any operator who shall fail to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent, shall pay a second delinquency penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the tax, in addition to the
amount of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 52/391
C. Fraud: If the tax administrator shall determine that the nonpayment of any remittance due pursuant to the provisions of this chapter is due to fraud, a
penalty in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to the penalties set forth in
subsections A and B of this section.
D. Interest: In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall pay interest at
the rate of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.
E. Penalties And Interest Merged With Tax: Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues, pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall become a
part of the tax required to be paid by the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-9: FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX:
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax, or any
portion thereof, required by the provisions of this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain the facts and
information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain
upon which to base the assessment of any such tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to
collect the tax and to make such report and remittance, the tax administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest
and penalties provided for by the provisions of this chapter. In the event such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give written notice of the
amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his
last known place of address. Such operator, within ten (10) days after the service or mailing of such notice, may make an application in writing to the tax
administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest
and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such an application is
made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a
time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing the operator
may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall
determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination
and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days, unless an appeal is filed as
provided in section 3-7-11 of this chapter. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-10: CESSATION OF BUSINESS:
Each operator shall notify the tax administrator ten (10) days prior to the sale or cessation of business for any reason, and returns and remittances shall be
due immediately upon the sale or cessation of business. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-11: APPEALS:
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city
council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days after the service or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The city council
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The
findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in this chapter for the service of a
notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-12: RECORDS:
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter to keep and
preserve, for a period of three (3) years after the date any such tax is due and payable, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such
tax as he may have been liable for the collection and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all
reasonable times during regular business hours. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-13: REFUNDS:
A. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid, or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the
city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, such amount may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section, provided a claim in
writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three (3)
years after the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.
B. Any operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
C. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the
manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient,
having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the
operator who collected the tax.

thereto. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-14: SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION OF PERMITS:
Whenever any operator fails to comply with any provision of this chapter relating to the transient occupancy tax or any rule or regulation of the tax
administrator relating to such tax prescribed and adopted by this chapter, the tax administrator, upon a hearing, after giving the operator ten (10) days'
written notice specifying the time and place of the hearing and requiring him to show cause why his permit or permits should not be revoked, may suspend
or revoke any one or more of the permits held by the operator. The tax administrator shall give to the operator written notice of the suspension or
revocation of any of his permits. The notices required by this section may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for the service of a
notice of a deficiency determination. The tax administrator shall not issue a new permit after the revocation of a permit unless he is satisfied that the former
holder of the permit will comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to the transient occupancy tax and the regulations of the tax administrator.
During any period of time during which a permit has not been issued or is suspended, revoked or otherwise not validly in effect, the tax administrator may
require that the hotel be closed. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-15: RECORDING CERTIFICATES; LIENS:
If any amount required to be remitted or paid to the city pursuant to this chapter is not remitted or paid when due, the tax administrator, within three (3)
years after the amount is due, may file for record in the office of the county recorder a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due,
the name and address, as they appear on the records of the tax administrator, of the operator liable for the same, and the fact that the tax administrator
has complied with all the provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be remitted and paid. From the time of the filing for
record, the amount required to be remitted, together with penalties and interest, shall constitute a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the
operator or afterwards and before the lien expires acquired by him. The lien shall have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue
for ten (10) years after the time of the filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-16: PRIORITY OF LIENS:
The amounts required to be remitted and/or paid by any operator pursuant to this chapter, with penalties and interest, shall be satisfied first in any of the
following cases:
A. Whenever the person is insolvent;
B. Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his assets;
C. Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors, administrators or heirs is insufficient to pay all of the debts due from the deceased; and
D. Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay any amount pursuant to this chapter is levied upon by
process law. This chapter shall not give the city a preference over any recorded lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be
paid became a lien.
The preference given to the city by this section shall be subordinate to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1204 through 1208. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-17: WARRANTS FOR COLLECTION OF LIENS:
At any time within three (3) years after any operator is delinquent in the remittance or payment of any amount required by this chapter to be remitted or
paid, or within three (3) years after the last recording of a certificate pursuant to section 3-7-15 of this chapter, the tax administrator may issue a warrant for
the enforcement of any lien and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city pursuant to this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to
any sheriff or marshal and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall be levied and the sale made pursuant to it in the same
manner with the same effect as a writ of execution. The tax administrator may pay or advance to the sheriff or marshal the same fees, commissions and
expenses for his services as are provided by law for similar services pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator, and not the court, shall approve
the fees for publication in a newspaper. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-18: SEIZURES AND SALES:
At any time within three (3) years after any operator is delinquent in the remittance or payment of any amount due pursuant to this chapter, the tax
administrator may forthwith collect the amount in the following manner: the tax administrator shall seize any property, real or personal, of the operator and
sell the property, or a sufficient part of it, at a public auction to pay the amount due together with any penalties and interest imposed for the delinquency
and any costs incurred on account of seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect transient occupancy taxes due shall be only of property of the operator
not exempt from execution under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-19: SUCCESSORS' LIABILITY; WITHHOLDINGS BY PURCHASERS:
If any operator liable for any amount pursuant to this chapter sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 54/391
of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that the amount has been paid or
a certificate stating that no amount is due. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-20: LIABILITY OF PURCHASERS; RELEASE:
If the purchaser of a hotel fails to withhold the purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be
withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a
certificate, or within sixty (60) days after the date the former owner's records are made available for audit, whichever period expires last, but in any event
not later than ninety (90) days after receiving the request, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail a notice to the purchaser at his
address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the amount which shall be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the tax
administrator to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as provided in this section. The time
within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his business or at the time the determination
against the operator becomes final, whichever occurs last. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-21: NOTICE TO WITHHOLD:
If any person or operator is delinquent in the remittance or payment of the amount required to be remitted or paid by him pursuant to this chapter, or in the
event a determination has been made against him for the remittance of the tax and the payment of the penalty, the city, within three (3) years after the tax
obligation became due, may give notice thereof by personal delivery to the hotel or by registered mail to all persons, including the state or any political
subdivision thereof, having in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the taxpayer. After receiving the
withholding notice, the person so notified shall make no disposition of the taxpayer's credits, other personal property or debts until the city consents to a
transfer or disposition or until sixty (60) days elapse after the receipt of the notice, whichever expires earlier. All persons, upon the receipt of such notice,
shall immediately advise the city of all such credits, other personal property or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them. If the notice
seeks to prevent the transfer or other disposition of a deposit in a bank or other credits or personal property in the possession or under the control of the
bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered or mailed to the branch or office of the bank at which the deposit is carried or at which the credits or
personal property is held. If any person so notified makes a transfer or disposition of the property or debts required to be held pursuant to this section
during the effective period of the notice to withhold, he shall be liable to the city to the extent of the value of the release up to the amount of the
indebtedness owed by the taxpayer to the city. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-22: EXTENSIONS OF TIME:
The tax administrator, for good cause, may extend for not to exceed one month the time for making any return or paying any amount required to be paid
pursuant to this chapter. The extension may be granted at any time, provided a request therefor is filed with the tax administrator within or prior to the
period for which the extension may be granted. Any person to whom an extension is granted shall pay, in addition to the tax, interest at the rate of one
percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax would have been due without the extension until the date of payment. (Ord.
736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-23: DIVULGING OF INFORMATION PROHIBITED:
It shall be unlawful for any person having an administrative duty pursuant to this chapter to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs,
operations or information obtained by an investigation of the records of any operator or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of his official
duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses or expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any return or to knowingly permit
any return, or copy thereof, or any abstract, or particular thereof, to be seen or examined by any person. Successors, receivers, trustees, executors,
administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, may be given information as to the items included in the amount of any unpaid tax or
amounts of tax, penalties and interest required to be collected. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990)
3-7-24: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:
A. Except for the failure of an operator to pay to the tax administrator taxes collected pursuant to this chapter, which failure to pay shall be punishable as a
felony pursuant to Penal Code section 424, every violation of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor and punishable as provided in the general penalty in
section 1-4-1 of this code.
B. If the offense is not otherwise punishable as set forth in subsection A of this section, any person wilfully failing to comply with, or knowingly violating,
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
C. Any operator or other person who wilfully fails or refuses to register as required by this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails
or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who wilfully makes any false or fraudulent report or
claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Such
misdemeanor shall be punishable as provided in the general penalty in section 1-4-1 of this code. (Ord. 736, 7-10-1990; amd. 2007 Code)

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES1
3-12-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses, including the regulation of live nude and live seminude
entertainment, in order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
to prevent any deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse
secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses. The city council finds that among these secondary effects are increased incidents of
unlawful conduct and disorderly behavior, generating a disproportionate demand for police responses; depreciated property values; vacancy problems;
blighted conditions; and interference with neighbors' enjoyment of property due to debris, noise, vandalism and depreciated property values. In
adopting this chapter, the city council takes legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies that substantiate the adverse
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses:
1. "Summary Of The Final Report Of The Attorney General's Commission On Pornography".
2. "Report To The American Center For Law And Justice On The Secondary Impacts Of Sex Oriented Business".
3. "Report Of The Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses".
4. "Final Report To The City Of Garden Grove: The Relationship Between Crime And Adult Business Operations On Garden Grove Boulevard".
5. "Adult Entertainment: Land Use And Legal Perspectives".
B. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any nonobscene
communicative materials, including nonobscene sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to nonobscene sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors
of nonobscene sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor is it the effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize

vehicle or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available, at the site.
If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he has not subsequently
acquiesced in its presence, the city manager shall not assess the cost of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the
vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such owner of the land.

opinion will cause less damage to trees owned by the city along and adjacent to said route. If necessary to protect such trees, the director may require that
said house, building or portions thereof to be cut into segments small enough to fit the available width between such trees along the designated route. As a
condition to approving any route for the moving of any building, house or portion thereof, the director may require the person doing such work to enter into

a condition as to prevent it from constituting a public nuisance as hereinabove defined. Nothing in this section shall preclude the immediate removal or
abatement by city forces of any obstruction, nuisance or overhang that is a public safety hazard. (Ord. 428, 12-17-1968)

with the city clerk within ten (10) days subsequent to the director's action. (Ord. 428, 12-17-1968)

F. Federal Or State Jurisdiction: This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and shall apply to all
franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter to the extent permitted by applicable law.
G. Franchise Nontransferable:
1. Grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale,
contract, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the city council and
then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the city council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed;
provided that such consent shall not be required for transactions between any parent, subsidiary or commonly owned entities. Any attempt to sell,
transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the city council shall be null and void. The granting of a security
interest in any grantee assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation solely for purposes of financing, shall not by itself be considered a transfer for
the purposes of this section.
2. The requirements of subsection G1 of this section shall apply to any change of control of grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to
major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. The acquisition or accumulation by any
person or group of persons acting in privity of forty percent (40%) of the voting shares or interests in grantee or any person which controls grantee
shall be presumed to constitute a change of control of grantee, but grantee shall be entitled to rebut such presumption.

3. Grantee shall notify grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of grantee. Such
notification shall be considered by grantor as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under
this section governing the consent of grantor to such change in control of ownership shall apply.
4. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, sale, transfer, lease, assignment, sublease, disposal or acquisition of
control, grantor may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee shall assist grantor in such inquiry. In
seeking grantor's consent to any change of ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of ensuring that the transferee completes any
required application identical or substantially similar to FCC form 394 "Application for Franchise Authority Consent to Assignment of Control of Cable
Television Franchise", or any successor form. An application shall be submitted to grantor not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date of transfer.
The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the qualifications and financial and technical capability to operate and maintain the
system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, background, and technical
qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory to grantor, grantor shall consent to the transfer of the franchise on such terms and conditions as it
determines in its discretion. The consent of grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed.
5. Any financial institution having a pledge of grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise
shall have the right to notify grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to grantor shall take control of and operate the cable television system, in the
event of a grantee default of its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation within thirty (30)
days of assuming such control that will ensure, to grantor's satisfaction, continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements, at least
the same level, during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the
system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by grantor in its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition
grantor to transfer the franchise to another grantee. If, by the end of the one year period, the financial institution has not petitioned for transfer to
another grantee, or if grantor does not consent to such transfer, the franchise shall cease and terminate at grantor's option.
6. At the time an application for a transfer is submitted to grantor, grantee shall deposit with grantor an application fee of one thousand five hundred
dollars ($1,500.00) to cover grantor's reasonable out of pocket processing and review expenses in connection with the transfer of the franchise or of
control of the franchise. The application fee shall not be charged against any franchise fee due to grantor during the term of the franchise.
H. Geographical Coverage:
1. Grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable television system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit within the public streets
and rights of way and public property in the city, subject to any service area and line extension requirements of the franchise agreement.
2. After service has been established by activating trunk and/or distribution cables for any service area, grantee shall provide service to any requesting
subscriber within that service area within thirty (30) days from the date of request, provided that grantee is able to secure all rights of way necessary
to extend service to such subscriber within such thirty (30) day period on reasonable terms and conditions.
I. Nonexclusive Franchise: Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional
franchises for a cable television system or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law, provided that if
grantor grants an additional franchise on terms more favorable to the second grantee (whether by the grant of greater benefits or the imposition of
lesser obligations), then the initial grantee shall have the right to renegotiate its franchise to incorporate the more favorable terms.
J. Multiple Franchises:
1. Grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable state or federal law. Grantor may limit the number of franchises granted, based
upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as:
a. The capacity of the public rights of way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as
electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.
b. The benefits that may accrue to cable subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.
c. The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights of way.
2. Each grantee awarded a franchise to serve the entire city shall offer cable service to all residences in the city, in accordance with construction and
service schedules mutually agreed upon between grantor and grantee, line extension policies, and applicable law.
3. Developers of new residential housing with underground utilities shall provide conduit to accommodate cables for at least two (2) cable systems.
4. Grantor may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in grantor's
opinion, the rights of way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables. (Ord. 95-011, 7-25-1995)

thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, the city council shall make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether or
not the franchise(s) should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. The city council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline
to grant any franchise.
D. Franchise Renewal: Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law. Grantor and grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal
negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. Unless agreed otherwise in the franchise renewal agreement, grantee shall reimburse grantor
for costs incidental to the franchise renewal award, not to exceed any maximum specified in the renewal agreement. Any such reimbursement shall not
be charged against any franchise fee due to grantor during the term of the franchise.
E. Minimum Consumer Protection And Service Standards:
1. Except as otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, grantee shall maintain a local area office (not necessarily within the city limits) to provide
the necessary facilities, equipment and personnel to comply with the following consumer protection and service standards under normal operating
conditions:

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 158/391
(12) The appropriate regulatory authority with whom to register a complaint and how to contact such authority.
Grantee shall also provide such written information at least annually to all subscribers and at any time upon request. Grantee shall notify all
subscribers and grantor at least thirty (30) days in advance of any significant changes in any of the above information.
g. Requests For Cable Service And Repairs:
(1) Grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.
Scheduled interruptions exceeding four (4) hours between twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight and six o'clock (6:00) A.M. and exceeding one hour
between six o'clock (6:00) A.M. and twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight shall be preceded by notice over the cable system to subscribers in the
affected area. To the extent that grantee can control them, scheduled interruptions shall occur during a period of minimum system use,
preferably between twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight and six o'clock (6:00) A.M.
(2) Grantee shall maintain a repair force of technicians capable of responding to subscriber requests for service within the following time frames
under normal operating conditions no less than ninety five percent (95%) of the time measured on a quarterly basis:
(A) Installation: An installation staff capable of installing service to any residential subscriber within seven (7) business days after receipt of a
request, in all areas where coaxial feeder cable has been activated within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the residence, provided that grantee
is able to secure all rights of way necessary to extend service to such subscriber on reasonable terms and conditions within such seven (7)
day period.
(B) Outages: Grantee will respond to service interruptions promptly and in no event later than twenty four (24) consecutive hours after becoming
aware of such interruption. Other service problems will be responded to within thirty six (36) consecutive hours during the normal work week.
(C) Inferior Reception Quality: Grantee will respond within thirty six (36) consecutive hours during the normal work week of receiving a request
for service identifying a problem concerning picture or sound quality.
(3) Grantee shall schedule, within a specified four (4) hour time period, appointments with subscribers for installation or service. Specifying
appointments as either "morning" or "afternoon" shall be deemed to comply with this requirement. The obligation of grantee to specify
installation or service appointments within a designated four (4) hour time period shall be consistent with grantee's scheduling calendar, such
that when available morning and afternoon appointments have been scheduled, additional subscribers requesting installation or service on such
days may be advised that grantee's service personnel may arrive at any point during the business day, the subscriber may request grantee to
make an appointment for morning or afternoon service on the next business day in which such appointments are available.
(4) Grantee shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under provisions of this subsection when a service representative arrives
at the service location and begins work on the problem. If an appointment was scheduled per subsection E1g(3) of this section, or an
appointment was not scheduled, and a subscriber is not home when a service representative arrives (within the appointment window if one was
scheduled), response shall be deemed to have taken place if the representative leaves written notification of arrival.
(5) The term "normal operating conditions" as used in this chapter means those service conditions which are within the control of grantee. Those
conditions which are not within grantee's control include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages, telephone
network outages, and severe or unusual weather conditions. Those conditions which are within grantee's control include, but are not limited to,
special promotions, pay per view events, rate increases, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or upgrade of the cable
system.
F. Complaint Procedures:
1. Grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by grantor. The written
procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing specifying the subscriber's grounds for
dissatisfaction. Grantee shall file a copy of these procedures with grantor.
2. Grantor shall have the right to review grantee's response to subscriber complaints in order to determine grantee's compliance with the franchise
requirements, subject to the subscriber's right to privacy.
G. Continuity Of Service:
1. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to grantee are honored. In the event
that grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or grantor gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, grantee shall act
so as to ensure that all subscribers receive service so long as the franchise remains in force.
2. In the event of a change of control of grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with grantor,
new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the original grantee shall be entitled to the
revenues for any period during which it operates the system.
3. Except as reasonably necessary for system maintenance, construction, rebuild, or upgrade activity, grantee shall not intentionally terminate the
ongoing operation of the cable system so as to deny cable service to its subscribers. Because the provision of cable service to subscribers is a
unique service, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for violation of this subsection G. Grantor shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance, as a remedy for violation of this subsection G. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the
exclusive remedy, but shall be in addition to any other remedy provided for in this chapter or the franchise agreement or at law or in equity.
H. Identification: All officers, agents or employees of grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with
members of the public or who require entry onto subscribers' premises shall carry a photo identification card in a form reasonably approved by grantor.
Grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle of grantee or its major subcontractors shall be clearly identified as working
for grantee.
I. Additional Service Standards: Additional service standards and standards governing consumer protection and response by grantee to subscriber
complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement, and grantee shall comply with such standards in
the operations of the cable television system. A verified and continuing pattern of noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise,
provided that grantee shall receive due process, including written notification and an opportunity to cure, prior to any sanction being imposed. For
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 159/391
purposes of this subsection I, the term "continuing" shall mean failure to maintain any such standard(s) three (3) or more times in any consecutive
twelve (12) month period where such failure causes a substantial adverse effect on the provision of cable service through grantee's cable system. Also
for purposes of this subsection I, the term "verified" shall mean verified by the city council or its designated representative.
J. Franchise Fee:
1. Following the issuance and acceptance of the franchise, grantee shall pay to grantor a franchise fee in the amount set forth in the franchise
agreement.
2. Grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished a statement within sixty (60) days of the close of the calendar year, either audited and certified by an
independent certified public accountant or certified by an officer of grantee, reflecting the total amounts of gross annual revenues and all payments,
deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment. Upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice, grantor shall have the right to
conduct an independent audit of grantee's records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures, and if such audit indicates a
franchise fee underpayment of two percent (2%) or more, grantee shall pay such underpayment to grantor within fifteen (15) calendar days and shall
assume all reasonable costs of such an audit.
3. Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or under the franchise agreement, for the
performance of any other obligation of grantee.
4. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, grantee
shall pay as additional compensation: (Ord. 95-011, 7-25-1995)
a. An interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the prime lending rate of the financial institution adopted by
resolution of the city council; and (Ord. 95-011, 7-25-1995; amd. 2007 Code)
b. If the payment is late by forty five (45) days or more, a sum of money equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due in order to defray those
additional expenses and costs incurred by grantor by reason of delinquent payment.
5. Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule indicated in the franchise agreement.
K. Security Fund:
1. Grantor may require grantee to provide a security fund in an amount and form established in the franchise agreement or a guarantee by a corporate
parent. The amount of any security fund shall be established based on the extent of grantee's obligations under the terms of the franchise.
2. The security fund or guarantee shall be available to grantor to satisfy all claims,liens and/or taxes due grantor from grantee which arise by reason of
construction, operation, or maintenance of the system, and to satisfy any actual or liquidated damages arising out of a franchise breach, subject to
the procedures and amounts designated in the franchise agreement.
3. If the security fund is drawn upon by grantor in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter and the franchise agreement, grantee
shall cause the security fund to be replenished to the original amount no later than thirty (30) days after each withdrawal by grantor. Failure to
replenish the security fund shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise.
L. Hold Harmless: Grantee's indemnity obligations shall be as specified in the franchise agreement.
M. Insurance: Grantee's insurance obligations shall be as specified in the franchise agreement.
N. Records Required And Grantor's Right To Inspect:
1. Grantee shall at all times maintain:
a. A record of all service calls and interruption or degradation of service experienced for the preceding two (2) years, provided that such complaints
result in or require a service call, subject to the subscriber's right of privacy as specified by applicable law.
b. A full and complete set of plans, records and "as-built" maps showing the locations of the cable television system installed or in use in the city,
exclusive of subscriber service drops and equipment provided in subscriber's homes.
c. If requested by grantor, a summary of service calls, identifying the number, general nature and disposition of such calls, on a quarterly basis. A
summary of such service calls shall be submitted to grantor within thirty (30) days following any grantor request, in a form reasonably acceptable
to grantor. If grantor determines, based on review of such summary, that grantor wishes to review grantee's records pertaining to individual service
calls reflected in the summary, grantee shall submit such records, subject to the subscribers' privacy rights under applicable law, within thirty (30)
days following grantor's request for the records.
2. Grantor may impose reasonable requirements for additional information, records and documents from time to time, provided they reasonably relate
to the scope of the city's rights under this chapter or grantee's franchise agreement.
3. Upon reasonable notice, and during normal business hours, grantee shall permit examination by any duly authorized representative of grantor of all
franchise property and facilities, together with any appurtenant property and facilities of grantee situated within or without the city, and all records
relating to the franchise, provided they are necessary to enable grantor to carry out its regulatory responsibilities under this chapter or the franchise
agreement. Grantee shall have the right to be present at any such examination. (Ord. 95-011, 7-25-1995)
7-7-6: DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
A. Grantee shall not construct any cable system facilities until grantee has secured the necessary permits from grantor or other affected public agencies.
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 160/391
B. In those areas of the city where transmission lines or distribution facilities of the public utilities providing telephone and electric power service are
underground, grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein underground.
C. In those areas of the city where grantee's cables are located on the aboveground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility providing
telephone or electric power service, and in the event that the facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are placed underground, then grantee
likewise shall reconstruct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost. Certain of grantee's
equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in aboveground
enclosures, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement.
D. Any changes in or extensions of any poles, anchors, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals or other fixtures and equipment (herein referred to as
"structures"), or the construction of any additional structures, in, upon, along, across, under or over the streets, alleys, public ways and public property
shall be made only after grantee has secured all permits required therefor and under the direction of grantor's city engineer or a designee. The height
above public thoroughfares of all aerial wires shall conform to the requirements of the California public utilities commission or other regulatory body
having jurisdiction thereof.
1. All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by grantee shall be constructed and located so as not to interfere with the
proper use of streets, alleys, other public ways and places, and public property and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said streets, alleys, other public ways and places, or public property, and not to interfere with
existing public utility installations.
2. In the event that any property or improvement of grantor in a public right of way is disturbed or damaged by grantee or any of its contractors, agents
or employees in connection with undertaking any work pursuant to the right granted to grantee pursuant to this chapter, grantee shall promptly, at
grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition, said property or improvement which was so disturbed or
damaged, and in the event that any such property or improvement shall at any later time become uneven, unsettled or otherwise require restoration,
repair or replacement because of such disturbance or damage by grantee, then grantee shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from grantor or
otherwise and at grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to its former condition said property or improvement which was
disturbed or damaged. Any such restoration by grantee shall be made in accordance with such materials and specifications as may, from time to
time, be then provided for by city ordinance.
3. Prior to commencing any work in the street, public rights of way, or public property, grantee shall obtain any and all permits lawfully required by such
grantor codes and ordinances of general application for such work. In the event that emergency work may be required by grantee, however, grantee
shall obtain any and all such permits within three (3) working days after the beginning of such emergency work.
4. There shall be no unreasonable or unnecessary obstruction of the public rights of way by grantee in connection with any of the work herein provided
for, and grantee shall maintain such barriers, signs and warning signals during any such work performed on or about the public rights of way or
adjacent thereto as may be required by applicable law and/or as may be necessary to reasonably avoid injury or damage to life and property.
5. If, at any time during the period of this franchise, grantor shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade or location of any street, alley or other public
rights of way, grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by grantor, remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes
and other fixtures at it own expense, and in each instance shall comply with the requirements of grantor.
6. Grantee shall not place poles, conduits or other fixtures above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone
fixtures, water hydrants or other utility, and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed as to comply with all
ordinances of grantor.
7. Grantee may be required by grantor to permit joint use of its poles, conduits and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys or other public rights of
way or public property, by utilities insofar as such joint use may be reasonably practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental therefor; provided
that if grantee and any public utility are unable to agree on the terms and conditions of such joint use within sixty (60) days after grantor requires the
joint use, grantee and the utility shall promptly submit the terms and conditions, including, without limitation, the rental therefor, to the appropriate
administrative agency having jurisdiction over the public utility, or if there is no such agency, the American arbitration association, for a final and
binding decision.
8. Grantee shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by grantor, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of
buildings, the expense of such temporary removal to be paid by the person requesting the same. Grantee shall be given not less than forty eight (48)
hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary changes, and may require payment in advance.
9. Grantee shall have the authority, except when in conflict with applicable grantor ordinances, to trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets,
alleys, sidewalks, public property or public places so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of
grantee, except that at the option of grantor, such trimming may be done by grantor, or under grantor's supervision and direction.
E. In new residential developments in which the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the following procedure shall apply with respect to
access to and utilization of underground easements:
1. The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire to provide cable
service to that development. The developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final development map
shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development.
2. If two (2) or more cable operators wish to provide service, they shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared cost
basis. If fewer than two (2) cable operators indicate interest, the developer shall provide conduit to accommodate two (2) sets of cable television
cables and dedicate to the city any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled to recover the costs of such initially unoccupied
conduit in the event that grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee.
3. The developer shall provide at least ten (10) working days' notice of the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed
to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall have two (2) working days to begin the installation of their cables, and
five (5) working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
4. The final development map shall not be approved until the developer submits evidence that it has, or has agreed in a subdivision agreement or other
development agreement with the city that it will:
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 161/391
a. Notify each grantee that underground utility trenches are to be open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed access to such
trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
b. Receive a written notification from each grantee that grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the specified terms and
conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the developer and grantee, or receive no reply from a grantee within
ten (10) days after notification to such grantee, in which case grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its facilities during the
open trench period.
5. Participating grantees shall share the joint utilities trench subject to compliance with state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance

surveys, shall be utilized as the basis for review. In addition, any subscriber may submit comments or complaints during the review meetings, either
orally or in writing, and these shall be considered. Within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of a system performance review meeting, grantor may
issue findings with respect to the cable system's franchise compliance and quality of service. If grantor determines that grantee is not in compliance
with the requirements of this chapter or grantee's franchise, grantor may direct grantee to correct the areas of noncompliance within a reasonable

compliance within such period and diligently achieve compliance thereafter, shall be considered a material breach of the franchise, and grantor may
exercise any remedy within the scope of this chapter and the franchise agreement.
B. Special Review Of System Performance: When grantor determines that there has been a pattern of complaints made or where there exists other
evidence which, in the judgment of grantor, casts reasonable doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service to the effect that grantee is not in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter or its franchise, grantor shall have the right to compel grantee to test, analyze and report on the
performance of the system in order to protect the public against substandard cable service. Grantor may not compel grantee to provide such tests or
reports unless and until grantor has provided grantee with at least thirty (30) days' notice of its intention to exercise its rights under this section and has
provided grantee with an opportunity to be heard prior to its exercise of such rights. Such test or tests shall be made and the report shall be delivered to
grantor no later than thirty (30) days after grantor notifies grantee that it is exercising such right, and shall be made at grantee's sole cost. Such report
shall include the following information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests, what system component was tested, the
equipment used and procedures employed in said testing, the results of such tests, and the method by which such complaints were resolved. Any other

which shall not be less than one hundred eighty (180) days or more than three hundred sixty five (365) days.
6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter, grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as it

thereof by any public utility or other grantee.

ordinance, and if such work is not completed within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof from grantor (except in cases of emergency
constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare) or, if more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required therefor, if grantee does not commence
such work within such thirty (30) day period and diligently complete the work thereafter, grantor may cause such work to be done and grantee shall
reimburse grantor the costs thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs. Without relieving grantee of such obligation,
grantor may recover all or a portion of such costs through the security fund provided by grantee.
C. Extended Operation And Continuity Of Services: Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, grantor shall have the discretion to grant a short term
license in lieu of a franchise to permit grantee to continue to operate the cable television system for a specific period of time, not to exceed twelve (12)
months. Grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the license and to provide the regular
subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue to receive all

or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding,
unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless: a) such
receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty (120) days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and
provisions of this chapter and the franchise, and the receivers or trustees within said one hundred twenty (120) days shall have remedied all the
defaults under the franchise or provided a plan, satisfactory to grantor, for the remedy of such defaults; and b) such receivers or trustees shall, within
said one hundred twenty (120) days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction whereby such receivers or trustees
assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted.

grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of grantee hereunder shall cease and
terminate thirty (30) days after service of such notice, unless: a) grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner that
this chapter provides; and b) such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and
conditions of the franchise.
E. Rights Reserved To Grantor:
1. In addition to any rights specifically reserved to grantor by this chapter, grantor reserves to itself every right and power which grantor may have
under any other statute, code or ordinance or under the franchise.
2. Grantor may waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if grantor determines that: a) it is in the public
interest to do so, and b) the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on grantee or the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver
shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not
be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the
statement so recites.
F. Rights Of Individuals:
1. Grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users or citizens on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin, age, sex or sexual orientation. Grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and

behavior cannot be identified.
4. In the conduct of providing its service or in pursuit of any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, grantee shall take reasonable steps to
prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or citizen's right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such rights exist pursuant
to applicable law. Grantee shall not without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority utilize the system's interactive two way

and federal privacy laws:
a. Any list containing the names and addresses of subscribers who request in writing to be removed from such list; and
b. Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual subscribers, without the prior written consent of such subscribers. This does not prohibit
grantee from providing composite ratings of subscriber viewing to any party.
G. Separability: If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting
with any federal or state law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect or for any other reason, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in
any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and
independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such
law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision thereof which had been held invalid
or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, or otherwise invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and
shall thereafter be binding on grantor and grantee, provided that grantor shall give grantee thirty (30) days' written notice of such change before
requiring compliance with said provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for grantee to comply with such provision.

4. The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the city distribution system which are utilized in conveying
city delivered domestic water to point of use.
B. Policy:
1. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the city water department unless the water supply is protected as
required by state laws and this chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the director if a backflow prevention device
required by state law or this chapter is not installed, tested or maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed,
bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
2. The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the director, city building inspector and
city fire marshal to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this chapter, exist. When such
a condition becomes known, the director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to their premises by providing for a physical break in the
service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state and city regulations relating to this chapter, plumbing and
water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
3. An approved backflow prevention device shall also be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or
immediately outside the building being served; but in all cases before the first branch line leading off the service line. (Ord. 2009-02, 7-28-2009)
8-1-13-5: TYPE OF PROTECTIVE DEVICE REQUIRED:
A. In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply which is not otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter, the city water
system shall be protected by an approved air gap (AG) separation or an approved reduced pressure principle (RPP) backflow prevention device.
B. In the case of any premises where there is any water or substance that would be objectionable, but not hazardous to public health if introduced into the
public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve (DCV) assembly.
C. In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health, which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential
hazard to the city water system, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air gap (AG) separation or an approved reduced pressure
principle (RPP) backflow prevention device, i.e., sewage treatment plants, pumping stations, chemical plants, hospitals and mortuaries.

4. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 8-2-7-6 of this chapter. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-2: SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS NOT SUBJECT TO CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The director of public works shall require appropriate reporting from those significant industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards. Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the director of public works at least once every six (6) months (on dates
specified by the director of public works) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the director of
public works. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-3: CHANGED CONDITIONS:
Each user must notify the director of public works of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the structure or
the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the change.
A. The director of public works may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including
the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 8-2-7-5 of this chapter.
B. The director of public works may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 8-2-7-7 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit under section 8-2-7-11 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
C. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-4: POTENTIAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING SLUG DISCHARGES:
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of public works
of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions
taken by the user.
B. Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director of public works, submit a detailed written report describing
the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
chapter.
C. Failure to notify the director of public works of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
D. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge
described in subsection A of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-5: UNPERMITTED USERS:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director of public works as the director of public
works may require. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-6: NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director of public works within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director of public works within thirty
(30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the director of public works has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user,
the director of public works must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the
repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if:
A. The director of public works monitors at the user's facility at least once a month; or
B. The director of public works samples between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the director of public
works receives the results of this sampling. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)

8-2-8-7: NOTIFICATION OF DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTES:
A. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR part 261 or California code of regulations title 22, chapter 11, section 66261.1 et seq. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than ten (10) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to
the extent such information is known and readily available to the user:
1. An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes;
2. An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and
3. An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
All notifications must take place no later than ten (10) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 8-2-8-3 of this
chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of section 8-2-8-1 of this chapter.
B. All notifications must take place no later than ten (10) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection needs to be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 8-2-8-3 of
this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of section 8-2-8-1 of this chapter.
C. In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director of public works, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such regulations.
D. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
E. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder,
or any applicable federal or state law. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-8: COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES:
Any industrial user not in compliance with this chapter or any discharge limitations shall abide by the provisions of a compliance schedule developed by
the director of public works.
The director of public works may require: a) the development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for the installation of technology required to
meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements; and b) the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial users as are
necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements, including, but not limited to, the reports
required in section 8-2-8-1 of this chapter. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-9: TIMING:
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States postal service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-10: SIGNATURES AND CERTIFICATION:
All reports shall be signed and certified as described in section 8-2-7-6 of this chapter. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-11: RECORDKEEPING:
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user and the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director of
public works. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-8-12: MONITORING AND ANALYSIS TO DEMONSTRATE CONTINUED COMPLIANCE:
A. The reports required by this chapter shall contain the results of sampling. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the director of public works
in lieu of the industrial user. Where the director of public works performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 204/391
not be required to submit the compliance certification required under section 8-2-7-6 of this chapter. In addition, where the director of public works itself
collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
B. The reports required by this chapter must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered
by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The director of public works shall require that frequency
of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, twenty four (24) hour
composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the director of public works. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director of
public works, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the
industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the director of public works, as appropriate.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports required in subsection 8-2-8-1A of this chapter (40 CFR
403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director of
public works may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by subsection 8-2-8-1D and section 8-2-8-2 of this chapter (40 CFR 403.12(e)
and 403.12(h)), the director of public works shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
D. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the regional administrator determines that the 40 CFR 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical
methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the regional administrator.
E. If the industrial user monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the director of public works,
using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-9: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
8-2-9-1: RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The director of public works shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this
chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director of public works ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
A. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director of public works will be permitted to
enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The director of public works shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. The director of public works may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy, according to the frequency required in the user's permit.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the director of public works and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the director of public works access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
F. The aforesaid officers and their authorized agents shall have the right of entry during usual business hours and at any time when, upon reasonable
cause, they believe there is an immediate hazard to life, health, or property, to inspect any and all buildings and premises in the performance of their
duties. The aforesaid officers and their authorized agents shall have the right to take independent samples of any discharge from any industrial user to
determine compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-9-2: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the director of public works has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
and welfare of the community, then the director of public works may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Fresno County superior court. (Ord. 2014-

8-2-10: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Confidential information is information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge
permits, and monitoring programs, and from the director of public works' inspection and sampling activities, and shall be available to the public without
restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director of public works, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord.
2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-11: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The director of public works shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the
users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The
term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
A. "Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits", defined herein as those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all of the wastewater
measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or
requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined by section 8-2-1-4 of this chapter;
B. "Technical review criteria (TRC) violations", defined herein as those in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of all of the wastewater measurements
taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits as defined by section 8-2-1-4 of this chapter multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease,
and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by section 8-2-1-4 of this chapter (daily maximum, long term
average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference
or pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director of public works'
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with

G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s) which the director of public works determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-12: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
8-2-12-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the director of public works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director of public works may serve upon that user a written notice of
violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof,
to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director of public works. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director of public
works to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-
2014)
8-2-12-2: CONSENT ORDERS:
The director of public works may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 8-2-
12-4 and 8-2-12-5 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-12-3: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 206/391
The director of public works may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director of public works and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.
Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-12-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the director of public works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director of public works may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-12-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the director of public works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director of public works
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-
2014)
8-2-12-6: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
A. When the director of public works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or

2. Three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per day for failing or refusing to timely comply with any compliance schedule established by the city;
3. Five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day for discharges in violation of any wastes discharge limitation, permit condition, or requirement issued,
reissued or adopted by the city; and
4. Ten dollars ($10.00) per gallon for discharges in violation of any suspension, cease and desist order or other orders, or prohibition issued, reissued,
or adopted by the city.
B. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after sixty (60) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of twenty five percent (25%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent (1%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director of public works to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director of public works may convene a hearing on the
matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The director
of public works may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-12-7: APPEALS:
Any person affected by any decision, action, or determination by the director of public works, interpreting or implementing the provisions of this chapter,
including, without limitations, the provisions of this chapter, or any industrial wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder by the director of public works,
excepting therefrom any decision, action, or determination of the director of public works to pursue either criminal penalties or civil judicial enforcement,
may file with the city clerk, within ten (10) days of the date of service of such decision, action or determination, a notice of appeal to the city council
appealing such decision, action or determination by the director of public works. The notice of appeal shall set forth in detail all facts supporting the
industrial user's appeal of the decision of the director of public works. The filing of the notice of appeal shall stay all further action required under any
notice of violation or cease and desist orders and accumulation of interest upon penalties thereon, pending final decision by the city council on the appeal;
provided, however, that nothing stated herein shall limit the authority of the director of public works to take such action or to make such directives as the
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 207/391
director of public works deems necessary to stop or prevent an ongoing or threatened violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, including actions or
directives to prevent or stop threatened damage to the POTW, pass-through, or threatened harm to the health or safety of the public. Such action shall
include, without limitation, continuing to physically block the industrial user's access to the sewer until the appeal is heard and decided by the city council.
(Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-12-8: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The director of public works may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The director of public works may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director of public works may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of
the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director of public
works may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director of public works that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 8-2-12-9 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing
the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director of public works prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under sections 8-2-12-3 and 8-2-12-9 of this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-12-9: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to the provisions in section 8-2-7-13 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
A. Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
B. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
C. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
D. Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
E. Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections 8-2-5-1, 8-2-5-2, and 8-2-5-3 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 8-2-12-3 of this
chapter why a proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director of public works shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-13: JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
8-2-13-1: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the director of public works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director of public works may petition the Fresno County superior court
through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of

of public works may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director of public works is empowered to take more
than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)
8-2-14: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
8-2-14-1: UPSET:
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused
by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of
subsection C of this section, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
3. The user has submitted the following information to the director of public works within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days:
a. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;
and
c. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)

8-2-14-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 8-2-5-
1A of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in subsection 8-2-5-1B of this chapter, with the exception of subsection B1, B2, or B8, if it can prove that it did
not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference
and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or
interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly
in compliance with its WDR/NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

8-2-14-3: BYPASS:
A. Definitions: For the purposes of this section:
BYPASS: The definition provided in section 8-2-1-4 of this chapter.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. Allowable Bypass: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also
is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections C and D of this section.
C. Notice Requirements:
1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director of public works, at least ten (10) days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
2. A user shall submit oral notice to the director of public works of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director of public works may waive the written report on a case by case
basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24) hours.
D. Prohibited Bypass:
1. Bypass is prohibited, and the director of public works may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
c. The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this section.
2. The director of public works may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director of public works determines that it
will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section. (Ord. 2014-003, 7-22-2014)

3. Where a boundary line is not indicated as following a street or alley and does not follow or coincide approximately with a lot line or property
ownership line, the boundary line shall be determined by the use of the scale designated on the zone plan.

no lot shall be deemed to be a legal substandard lot within the exception of the minimum lot area requirements where such lot, at the time of
adoption of this title had, or any time after the adoption of this title, has a common side lot line with another lot under a common ownership.
H. Where a group of legal substandard lots have common side lot lines and are under a common ownership, and have in the aggregate less than the

A. Definitions:
CORNER CUTOFF AREA: The triangular area of a reversed corner lot, where the rear and street side yard property lines meet. Said area is
determined by measuring from that intersection along both the rear and street side property lines, a distance equal to the front yard setback distance of
the abutting property, then connecting those points, thereby forming that triangle.
FENCE: Any structural device forming a vertical physical barrier, other than a wall (solid masonry wall) as described below, intended to either mark the
boundary of property, or act as a visual, noise, or security barrier. A fence may be made of a variety of materials including wire mesh, steel mesh,
chainlink, ornamental iron, masonry, louvered glass, wood slat or stake and other similar materials, and constructed with or without openings: e.g.,
open framework such as wrought iron or a solid fence such as cedar or redwood planks.
HEDGE: A series of plant material arranged in a formal pattern to create a barrier of plants which are cut, clipped, or hedged to create a living fence.
WALL, OR SOLID MASONRY WALL: Any structure or device approved by the director designed to prevent the passage of light, air, and vision, and
substantially reduce noise levels.
B. Standards:
1. No fence, hedge or wall over three feet (3') in height shall be permitted in any required front yard setback area or within the excepted "corner cutoff
area" defined above.
2. Alternatively, a wrought iron or tubular steel type fence, whereas at least ninety percent (90%) of the fence shall be open for the passage of light and
air, may be constructed to a maximum height of four feet (4') in the front yard setback area, except within any defined corner cutoff area (see
subsection C of this section).
3. Fences, hedges, and walls, not greater than seven feet (7') in height, shall be permitted on all rear and side property lines, and on or to the rear of all
front yard setback lines.
4. If a residential district is adjacent to, or the adjoining property line which is a district boundary is abutting a commercial, office, or industrial district, it
shall be separated therefrom by erecting a six foot (6') high wall on said property line.
5. The height of a fence, hedge or wall, shall be measured from the ground to the high point of the fence, hedge or wall, excluding the post or column.
In the case of a fence or wall, whenever the posts/columns are spaced eight feet (8') apart or more, they may extend a maximum of six inches (6")
above the top of the fence/wall. Whenever there is a grade separation at the fence/property line between two (2) or more abutting properties, the
height shall be measured from the highest grade.

permitted in the required side or rear yard subject to an administrative review process.
7. A fence or wall shall be constructed along the perimeter of all areas considered by the council or planning commission to be dangerous to the public
health and safety. Solid masonry walls to mitigate noise generated by vehicular traffic may be constructed on property lines abutting arterial streets,
expressways, highways, and freeways. The height of such wall shall be determined by the council in relation to the danger or hazard involved. Said
fence or wall may be required when a use requires a permit or at the discretion of the council according to the danger or hazard involved.
8. Notwithstanding other provisions of this code, the director may approve, with good cause, an increased height of any required fence, hedge or wall
to a maximum of eight feet (8').

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
10-11-1: PURPOSES:
Planned unit developments (PUDs), involving the careful application of design, are encouraged to achieve a more functional, aesthetically pleasing and
harmonious living and working environment within the city which otherwise might not be possible by strict adherence to the regulations of this title.
In certain instances, the objectives of this title may be achieved by the development of planned units which do not conform in all respects with the land use
pattern designated on the zone plan or the district regulations prescribed by this title. A planned unit development may include a combination of different
dwelling types and/or a variety of land uses which are made to complement each other and harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity,
by design. In order to provide locations for such well planned developments, the planning commission is empowered to grant use permits for planned unit
developments, subject to appeal to the city council, provided that such developments comply with the regulations prescribed in this chapter. Lands may
also be zoned for PUD under the provisions of chapter 22 of this title. (Ord. 98-04, 4-14-1998)
10-11-2: DISTRICTS:
A PUD may be located in any district upon the granting of a use permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or by applying the PUD combining
district in accordance with the provisions of chapter 22 of this title. (Ord. 98-04, 4-14-1998)
10-11-3: PERMITTED USES:
A PUD shall include only those uses permitted, either as permitted uses or conditional uses, in the zoning district in which the planned unit development is
located, subject to the following exceptions:
A. Any use permitted in any R, RM or PO district as a permitted use or conditional use, or any combination of such uses may be included in a PUD located
in a UR, R or RM district.
B. Any use permitted in any RM, PO or CS district as a permitted use or conditional use or a combination of such uses may be located in a PUD located in
a CC district.
C. Any use permitted in any CS, ML or MH district as a permitted use or conditional use, or any combination of such uses may be located in a PUD
located in an ML or MH district.
D. Only mobile home dwellings located on permanent foundations may be included within a planned unit development for a mobile home subdivision.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 275/391
10-11-4: SITE AREA:
The minimum site area for a PUD shall be one acre. (Ord. 98-04, 4-14-1998)
10-11-5: STANDARDS:
A. The standards of site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, distances between structures, off street parking and off street loading facilities
and landscaped areas need not be equivalent to the standards prescribed for the regulations for the district in which the PUD is located if the applicant
has demonstrated by his design proposal that the objectives of this title and the objectives of this chapter will be achieved.
B. The average population density per net acre may exceed by not more than twenty five percent (25%) the maximum population density prescribed by the
site area regulations or the site area per dwelling unit regulations for the district in which the PUD is to be located, if the applicant can demonstrate by
his design proposal and such additional evidence as may be submitted, that the objectives of this chapter will be achieved. Since a planned unit
development may also involve the subdivision process, the applicant must be prepared to show what changes in conventional street and lot design will
be necessary to achieve desired goals. (Ord. 98-04, 4-14-1998)
10-11-6: REQUIRED CONDITIONS:
No use shall be permitted and no process, equipment or materials shall be employed which are found by the planning commission to be objectionable to
persons residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to property located in the vicinity by reason of odor, fumes, dust, smoke, cinders, dirt, refuse, water
carried wastes, noise, vibration, illumination, glare, unsightliness or heavy truck traffic or to involve any hazard of fire or explosion. (Ord. 98-04, 4-14-1998)
10-11-7: USE PERMIT PROCEDURE:
The regulations prescribed in sections 10-18-2 through 10-18-16 of this title shall control the procedure for making application for and processing of a use
permit for a planned unit development, subject to the following procedures:
A. In lieu of the drawing of the site prescribed in subsection 10-18-3G of this title, the application shall be accompanied by a general development plan of
the entire planned unit development, drawn to scale and showing provisions for: draining of surface waters, watercourses, railroad and public utility
rights of way, streets, driveways and pedestrian walks, off street parking and loading facilities, reservations and dedications for public uses, private
uses including dwelling types, lot layout, locations, heights and elevations of structures and landscaped areas.
B. In addition to the data and drawings prescribed in section 10-18-3 of this title and subsection A of this section, the application shall be accompanied by
a tabulation of the area proposed to be devoted to each land use and a tabulation of the average population density and number of housing units per
net acre in the area or areas proposed to be devoted to residential use.
C. When a PUD involves proposals which necessitate the filing of a tentative subdivision map and/or which would also necessitate the granting of
exceptions of the regulations of the subdivision ordinance, the planning commission may grant tentative approval of the proposal. Where such tentative
approval is requested by the applicant, the requirements of subsections A and B of this section may be waived temporarily, provided the applicant
submits the following:
1. In lieu of the drawing of the site prescribed in subsection A of this section, the application shall be accompanied by a schematic drawing drawn to a
minimum scale of one inch equals one hundred feet (1" = 100'), showing the general relationships contemplated among all public and private uses
and existing and proposed physical features.
2. A written statement setting forth the source of water supply, method of sewage disposal, means of drainage, dwelling types, nonresidential uses, lot
layout, public and private access, height of structures, lighting, landscaped areas and provisions for maintenance of landscaped areas, area to be
devoted to various uses and population density per net acre contemplated by the applicant.
Upon approval of a tentative subdivision map, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the subdivision ordinance, the applicant shall submit
a development plan in accordance with the requirements of subsections A and B of this section before the planning commission may grant a final
approval of the applicant's proposal.
D. The planning commission shall give written notice to the applicant of the time when the application will be considered by the planning commission.
E. The commission may grant a use permit for a PUD as the use permit was applied for or in modified form if, on the basis of the application and the
evidence submitted, the commission makes the following findings:
1. That the proposed location of the PUD is in accordance with the objectives of this title.
2. That the proposed location of the PUD and the conditions under which it would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.
3. That the proposed PUD will comply with each of the applicable provisions of this section.
4. That the standards of population density, site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, height of structures, distance between structures, off
street parking and off street loading facilities, landscaped areas and street design will produce an environment of stable and desirable character
consistent with the objectives of this title, and will not generate more traffic than the streets in the vicinity can carry without congestion and will not
overload utilities.
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 276/391
5. That the combination of different dwelling types and/or variety of land uses in the development will complement each other and will harmonize with
existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity.
F. The planning commission may deny an application for a use permit for a planned unit development if it is unable to make one or more of the required
findings.
G. Planning commission decisions regarding use permits for planned unit developments may be appealed and such appeals shall be processed in
accordance with the provisions of sections 10-18-20 and 10-18-21 of this title. The city council may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the
planning commission on an application for a use permit for a planned unit development; provided that if a decision denying a use permit is reversed or
a decision granting a use permit is modified, the city council shall, on the basis of the record transmitted by the planning commission and such
additional evidence as may be submitted, make the findings prerequisite to the granting of a use permit for a PUD prescribed in subsection E of this
section.
H. A decision on a use permit which has been the subject of an appeal to the city council shall become final immediately on the date on which the decision
is made by the city council. (Ord. 98-04, 4-14-1998)
Chapter 12
OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING
10-12-1: PURPOSES AND APPLICATION:
In order to alleviate progressively or to prevent traffic congestion and shortage of curb spaces, off street parking and off street loading facilities shall be
provided incidental to new land uses and major alterations and enlargements of existing land uses. The number of parking spaces and the number of
loading berths prescribed in this chapter or to be prescribed by the planning commission shall be in proportion to the need for such facilities created by the
particular type of land use. Off street parking and loading areas are to be laid out in a manner which will ensure their usefulness, protect the public safety
and, where appropriate, insulate surrounding land uses from their impact.
Provisions of this chapter are also intended to deal with major problems, conditions and needs which are apparent in attempting to provide sufficient off
street parking facilities in areas of intense commercial development, including: the difficulty in assembling land by private means; the often excessive time
required in assembling land by private means; the varying financial capabilities and traffic generating characteristics among the various types of
commercial enterprise; the importance of avoiding the development of a fragmented pattern of off street parking facilities which may bear little relation to
the needs of a commercial area as a whole; the importance of prescribing regulations which will not inadvertently discourage private investment within the
community, while alleviating or preventing traffic congestion; and the importance of achieving a reasonable distribution of burden among private interests
and the public at large consistent with their individual and collective responsibilities to provide off street parking facilities. (Ord. 622, 9-2-1980)
10-12-2: OFF STREET PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED:

In the side or front area of the property, provided that a variance is requested and approved by the planning commission and city council prior to such
installation. In requesting a variance, the applicant must provide the following:
a. The applicant must show that a usable satellite signal is not obtainable from the rear yard location on the property.
b. That the view from public rights of way can be screened by aesthetically attractive means in keeping with the neighborhood without unreasonably

A. Intent: The intent of this section is to encourage more dense and orderly development of urban uses which include gathering places where residents
may interact, work, and obtain goods and services in the same general location. There should be an emphasis on pedestrian activities and linkages,
priority transit routes and facilities to serve the development, and reducing the number of vehicular miles traveled by promoting alternative modes of
transportation, including pedestrian pathways, bicycling pathways, and public transportation as major facets in the design of each project. The director
may use his/her discretion to modify the project design, including, but not limited to: requiring that all or a portion of the ground (street) level floor space
be dedicated to residential uses, accessibility from adjacent public and/or private sidewalks, requiring parking areas and open space orientation that
encourages accessibility to pedestrians and separates pedestrians from vehicles, requiring dedicated footpaths, and requiring any other modification to
project design that encourages pedestrian use, including its interaction with the surrounding planned and existing development, street patterns,
neighborhoods, and the city.
B. Applicable Zone Districts Where A Mixed Use Project Is Permitted:

SIGNS AND OUTDOOR ADVERTISING
10-14-0: INTENT:
This chapter shall be known and cited as the SIGN ORDINANCE. When used, "this chapter" means the sign ordinance. This chapter shall control the
regulation of signs and/or advertising, and shall supersede all provisions of the zoning ordinance pertaining to the regulation of signs and/or advertising.
(Ord. 2013-006, 1-14-2014)
10-14-1: PURPOSE AND APPLICATION:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations and procedures for regulating signs, including the type, size, location and construction standards of
signs by zone district. Signs have an obvious impact on the character and quality of the city. The intent of these regulations is to provide a set of standards
for on site and off site signs to safeguard the life, health, property, and the public welfare, while encouraging creativity, variety and compatibility and
enhancement of the image of the city of Reedley.
The objectives of this chapter include the following:
A. To reinforce that the sign should serve primarily to identify the general nature of an establishment or to direct attention to a project, activity, place,
person, organization, or enterprise.
B. As identification devices, signs must not subject the public to excessive competition for their visual attention. As appropriate identification devices, signs
must harmonize with the building, the neighborhood, and other signs in the area.
C. The city intends to encourage the installation of signs that improve the appearance of the property and the neighborhood and to enhance the economic
effectiveness of signs.
D. The provisions in this chapter provide standards to safeguard life, health, property, and public welfare in keeping with the character of the city by
regulating the size, height, structural design, quality of materials, construction, location, electrification, illumination, animation, and maintenance of all
types of signs and sign structures.
E. The provisions in this chapter present criteria indicating whether or not signs conform to the above intentions of suitability and safety. (Ord. 2013-006, 1-
14-2014)

immediate vicinity. Freestanding signs shall be finished with the same or compatible materials as the building on the site.
B. Sign Area: The area of individual signs shall be measured as follows:
1. Sign Faces Counted: Where a sign has two (2) faces containing sign copy which are oriented back to back and separated by not more than twenty
four inches (24") at any point, the area of the sign shall be measured using one sign face only.
2. Wall Mounted Letters: Where a sign is composed of letters individually mounted or painted on a building wall, without a border or decorative
enclosure, the sign area is that of the smallest area within which all letters and words can be enclosed.
3. Three-Dimensional Signs: Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects such as balls, cubes, clusters of objects, or sculptural or
statue type trademarks, the sign area shall be measured as the area of the smallest rectangle within which the object(s) can be enclosed, when
viewed from a point where the largest area of the object(s) can be seen.
4. Size: Notwithstanding applicable sign standards elsewhere in this chapter, sign size shall be proportionate to the size and scale of the site and
building upon which the sign is proposed. Sign dimensions as specified in this chapter are maximum allowable dimensions; it may be necessary that
signs be smaller than the maximum allowed in order to be proportionate in size and scale to achieve the design objectives of this section.
5. Commercial And Industrial Center Signs: Individual tenant signs within multi-tenant centers shall be coordinated in size, location, materials and
illumination.
6. Color: Colors shall be used in coordinated groupings, and shall be compatible with those colors used in the building or project design. In general, a
dark sign background is preferred with light colored copy (characters/graphics).
7. Logos And Trademarks: The use of established corporate colors or logos shall not be prohibited by this section. When established corporate colors
are incompatible with building's colors, compatibility in design with the surrounding development shall be accomplished through the use of
appropriate background colors or other design features.
8. Lighting Intensity: The light emitted or reflected by a sign, or emitted by a light source, shall be of reasonable intensity and shall be compatible with
the architecture of the building and the immediate vicinity. Artificial light sources shall be shielded to prevent light spillage, glare or annoyance to
persons on or inside adjoining properties or to public or private rights of way.
9. Illumination: Internally illuminated signs where the entire face of the sign is illuminated rather than just the graphics, are not consistent with the
desired character of signs within the city and are discouraged. Illumination of established corporate logos or trademarks shall not be prohibited by
this provision.
10. Sign Bases And Frames: Freestanding signs shall be either housed in a frame, or set onto a base, presenting a solid, attractive, and well
proportioned appearance. The size and shape of the frame or base shall be proportionate to the size and mass of the sign and should be low profile
in design. Pole type signs are not permitted.
11. Landscaping: Freestanding signs shall be located in a landscaped area proportionate to the size of the sign. Appropriate accent landscaping should
be placed at the base of the sign.

nature of the business along with address of the site. On freestanding signs, sign copy shall be designed to contribute to the design of the structure
on which it is displayed. In all cases, freestanding sign design and sign copy should be coordinated to provide an attractively designed freestanding
element which identifies the development or project. On freestanding signs, a sign containing a telephone number and/or website of the business on
site may be displayed between the pedestal and the base of the sign, measuring no more than one foot (1') in length and no more than forty percent

adopt standards regarding murals, their location and design.
1. Location: Murals may be located on the sides of buildings and walls on property in any Commercial, Industrial or Public/Quasi-Public Zone District
within the City.
2. Mural Design Approval: Prior to painting, installation and execution of a mural, an application shall be submitted to the Community Development
Department. The application shall include a detailed drawing or sketch of the mural plus other details as prescribed on the application or deemed by
the Community Development Department staff to be pertinent. The Community Development Department shall forward the application, with a
recommendation, to the City Council. The City Council shall review and approve, approve with modifications, or deny the application as submitted.
3. Criteria For Design Of Murals:
a. Subject Matter: The subject matter shall be of historical significance regarding the growth and development of the City and its surrounding
environs and be of such high quality as to be appropriate. A mural shall not contain elements that advertise an existing business or product.
b. Paint: The paint to be used shall be appropriate for use in an outdoor locale, for an artistic rendition and shall be of a permanent, long lasting
variety.
c. Qualified Artists: The mural shall be designed and painted by qualified mural artists with sufficient knowledge in the design and painting of such
projects.
d. Vandal Resistant: To the extent feasible, the mural shall be vandal and graffiti resistant.
e. City Council Approval: Approval of a mural design shall occur only after public notice and an opportunity for interested parties to present any
appropriate comments, either in writing or orally, to the Planning Commission.
f. Mural Design Amendment: Prior to amending an approved mural design (whether painted or not painted), an application for an amendment shall

I. Real Estate Signage: It is the intent of the City Council, for purposes of promoting the local economy, tourism, and for further purposes of beautifying the
City, to adopt standards regarding real estate signage, their location and design.
1. For Sale Or Lease: On-site or structure signs not exceeding four (4) square feet for single-family or duplexes and sixteen (16) square feet for
multifamily, business, and industrial sites of up to two (2) acres in area, thirty two (32) square feet total sign area for multifamily, business, and
industrial sites of two (2) acres or larger, and one in number per street frontage;
2. Open House; On Site: On-site or structure signs, between the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. daily, not exceeding
four (4) square feet per sign and one in number per site or structure; and
3. Open House; Off-Site Residential: Open house signs for single-family, including duplexes, between the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. and seven
o'clock (7:00) P.M. daily, not exceeding four (4) square feet per sign and one in number in the neighborhood of sales; not to be located in any center
median of a public road or in a sidewalk right-of-way; and directional arrows with addresses not exceeding six (6) in number in the neighborhood of
sales. In adopting this exemption for off-site residential open house signs, the Council finds as follows:
a. The City has a compelling interest to exempt certain signs to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter and to allow for the use of signs
with minimal aesthetic impact because of their size and temporary nature.
b. The single-family residential real estate industry is distinct from other industries in that there are generally no storefronts available for advertising
and most homes are not located adjacent to heavily traveled streets. This makes off-site signs that advertise available homes necessary for
potential buyers to find them.
c. Real estate signs do not advertise goods or services, but actual locations. Directing potential buyers to an available home is necessary to facilitate
real estate transactions as potential buyers must be able to find and view the available homes.
d. Single-family real estate sales are temporary and infrequent as opposed to sales from commercial businesses. Exempting single-family open
house real estate signs will not lead to a proliferation of unsightly signs because they will be used only during very limited times when there is an
open house, will be removed at the end of each day of use, and once a home is sold will no longer be used.
e. Exempting off-site open house real estate signs is necessary to allow homeowners to efficiently advertise and sell their properties as quickly as
possible and to assist potential buyers in finding available homes within our community. (Ord. 2018-008, 1-8-2019)
10-14-11: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
The lawful use of a sign existing on the effective date of this chapter, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, may be thus
continued; provided, however, a nonconforming sign which has been abandoned, or the use for which it is advertised has ceased to function for a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days or more, shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
A. No nonconforming sign shall in any manner (except for face changes) be structurally altered, reconstructed, or moved without being made to comply
with the provisions of this chapter; however, nothing herein shall prohibit the painting, maintenance, or repairing of such sign, including the face and
changing of copy.
B. If, at any time, any sign in existence or maintained on the effective date of this chapter, which does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, is
destroyed by fire, accident, explosion or act of nature to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the value thereof, such sign shall be subject to all
the provisions of this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, the value of any sign shall be the estimated cost of replacement of the sign in kind as
determined by the chief building official.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 304/391
C. The chief building official or his/her designee shall immediately cause the removal of any sign which, in the judgment of the Community Development

any or a combination of the following methods using sound judgment under the circumstances:
1. Removal or modification of said sign by City staff with business owner (or property owner if business has ceased operations) to be billed for time and
materials.

A minor deviation of up to ten percent (10%) in permitted sign area standards may be granted by the Community Development Director upon written
request, subject to such conditions as the Director may impose without any notice or appeal, if the Community Development Director finds that granting
the minor deviation would not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property and improvements in the area in which the property is located.
A. Findings: A minor deviation may be granted upon making the following findings:
1. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions which apply to the property involved or the existing or intended use of the
property which do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning district.
2. Granting of a minor deviation will not negatively impact surrounding properties. (Ord. 2013-006, 1-14-2014)

USES PERMITTED BY ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL
10-17-1: PURPOSE:
A. The purpose of requiring administrative approval of certain enumerated uses is to determine whether or not, in any particular case, a use listed under
provisions in the district regulations entitled "Permitted Uses Requiring Administrative Approval" should be treated as a conditional use because of the
peculiar circumstances and conditions of the case. This chapter sets forth the procedure for approval of such use by an administrative act where
findings can be made that such use is in conformance with the intent and provisions of the district regulations and other applicable regulations of this
title. The provisions of this chapter take cognizance of the impracticality of listing certain uses as categorically possessing the characteristics of those
uses listed under either the permitted uses or conditional uses sections of the various districts provided in this title.

10-18A-6: DEFINITIONS:
The provisions of this section shall be known as the definitions. The purpose of these provisions is to promote consistency and precision in the
interpretation of the deemed approved alcoholic beverage sale regulations. The meaning and construction of words and phrases as hereinafter set forth
shall apply throughout the deemed approved alcoholic beverage sale regulations, except where the context of such words or phrases clearly indicates a
different meaning or construction.
As used in this article:
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE: Alcohol, spirits, liquor, wine, beer, and every liquid or solid containing alcohol, spirits, wine, or beer, which contains one-half of
one percent or more of alcohol by volume and which is fit for beverage purposes either alone or when diluted, mixed, or combined with other substances,
and sales of which requires a state department of alcoholic beverage control license.
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE SALES COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY: The retail sale, for on or off premises consumption, of liquor, beer, wine, or other alcoholic
beverages, excluding full service restaurants that comply with the definition of Full Service Restaurant.
CONDITION OF APPROVAL: A requirement which must be carried out by the activity in order to retain its deemed approved status.
DEEMED APPROVED ACTIVITY: Any legal nonconforming alcoholic beverage sales commercial activity, as defined in this section, in existence
immediately prior to the effective date of the deemed approved alcoholic beverage sale regulations shall be considered a deemed approved activity as
long as it complies with the deemed approved performance standards as set forth in section 10-18A-5 of this article, and shall no longer be considered a
legal nonconforming activity.
DEEMED APPROVED STATUS: The status conferred upon a deemed approved activity. Deemed approved status replaces legal nonconforming status.
FULL SERVICE RESTAURANT: A place which is regularly and in a bona fide manner used and kept open for the serving of at least lunch and dinner to
guests for compensation and which has suitable kitchen facilities connected therewith, containing conveniences for cooking an assortment of foods which
may be required for such meals. The sale or service of sandwiches (whether prepared in a kitchen or made elsewhere and heated up on the premises) or
snack foods shall not constitute a full service restaurant. To be considered a full service restaurant under this article, the establishment must meet the
following criteria; the following criteria are intended to reflect guidelines established by ABC for licensed restaurants:
A. A "full service restaurant" shall serve "meals" to guests at all times the establishment is open for business. An establishment shall not be considered
a "full service restaurant" if it serves alcohol without "meal" service being provided with the exception that alcohol sales to restaurant patrons may
continue for up to two (2) hours after meal service has ceased to allow guests to comfortably complete their meals.
B. There shall be a real offer or holding out to sell "meals". Premises shall make an offer or holding out of sales of "meals" to the public by maintaining
and displaying a printed menu and/or a menu board. A two-thirds (2/3) majority of the items offered on the menu shall be available at any given time
the establishment is open. The mere offering of "meals" without actual sales shall not be deemed sufficient.
C. The "offer" of "meals" is not adequate to meet the above criteria. A "full service restaurant" shall make actual and substantial sales of "meals" to
guests for compensation. Substantial sales shall mean that no less than sixty percent (60%) of total revenue shall be generated from food service
and no more than forty percent (40%) of revenue from the sales of alcohol.
D. "Meals" means the usual assortment of foods commonly ordered at various times of the day for the cuisine served. The service of snack foods
and/or appetizers alone shall not be deemed compliance with this requirement. "Meals" shall be prepared on the premises. Heating of food prepared
elsewhere shall not constitute a meal for the purposes of this definition.
E. Premises shall be equipped for meal service and maintained in good faith. Premises must possess and maintain appliances for the cooking of a
variety of foods such as stoves, ovens, broilers, or other devices, as well as pots, pans, or containers that can be used for cooking. Premises shall
possess the necessary utensils, table service, and condiment dispensers with which to serve "meals" to the public.
F. A full service restaurant shall comply with all local health department standards.
G. A full service restaurant may have a separate lounge or bar area provided that the restaurant and bar/lounge area operate as a single entity. The
physical layout, entry location(s), spatial connection between the areas, and operational characteristics, among other factors, shall be used to
determine compliance. Any bar/lounge area cannot remain open when the dining area is closed. However, the dining area may be open while the
bar/lounge area is closed.
H. To the extent that ABC regulations conflict with the above criteria, a full service restaurant shall comply with all state department of alcoholic
beverage control regulations related to "bona fide public eating place, meals".
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY: An activity which has been finally determined to be in noncompliance with the deemed approved performance standards in this
article. Such an activity shall lose its deemed approved status and shall no longer be considered a deemed approved activity.
LEGAL NONCONFORMING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE SALES COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY OR LEGAL NONCONFORMING ACTIVITY: An alcoholic
beverage sales commercial activity which was a nonconforming use pursuant to the nonconforming use regulations in section 10-15-7 of this title, and for
which a valid state of California alcoholic beverage control license had been issued and used in the exercise of the rights and privileges conferred by the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 324/391

a deemed approved activity, and shall no longer be considered a legal nonconforming activity, except such activity shall be subject to those zoning
regulations relating to nonconforming uses as specified in section 10-15-7 of this title, as of the effective date of the deemed approved alcoholic beverage
sale regulations.

approved status of the deemed approved activity in question shall be reviewed by the planning commission at a public hearing. Notification of the public
hearing shall be in accordance with section 10-18-4 of this chapter.

appellant in those cases where the applicant is not the appellant; the adverse party or parties, or to the attorney, spokesperson, or representative of such
party or parties; other interested groups and neighborhood associations who have requested notification; and to similar groups and individuals as
appropriate, of the date and place of the hearing on the appeal.

standards and/or conditions of approval, and may continue or revoke a deemed approved status; or require such changes in the existing use or impose
such reasonable conditions of approval as are, in its judgment, necessary to ensure conformity to said performance standards.
The city council shall vote on the appeal within thirty (30) days after its first hearing of the appeal. If the council is unable to decide the appeal at that

required to:
1. Dedicate all necessary rights of way to widen a bordering minor or collector street to the extent of one-half (1/2) the ultimate width established by the
city as the standard for such minor or collector street, or the full extent required for a frontage road.

10-19-9: RELATIONSHIP TO ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTING PROCEDURES:
A. Environmental Impact Assessment: A site plan approved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be considered in relation to requirements of city
policy governing the preparation of environmental impact assessments.
It is the intent of this chapter that an environmental impact assessment (EIA) be made concurrently with and as part of the site plan review process,
and that a site plan may be approved with conditions that will permit the city council to find that the proposed project will not have a significant effect on
the environment and that a negative declaration should be prepared.
B. Environmental Impact Reports: Where it is determined by the city that an environmental impact report (EIR) is required for a proposed project, action on
a proposed site plan shall be deferred until such time as the EIR has been prepared and reviewed pursuant to provisions of the city's guidelines and
state law. The planning commission and city council shall, at the completion of said EIR review, attach such conditions to the approval of the site plan
as in their judgment will mitigate or reduce to acceptable levels any of the environmental impacts identified during review of the EIR. The planning
commission or city council may deny a site plan if it is found that such mitigation or reduction of environmental impacts is not feasible. (Ord. 622, 9-2-
1980)

that the proposed building location, facilities and improvements are in conformity with the approved site plan. Before a building may be occupied or a sign
erected, the building official shall certify to the planning commission that such improvements have been made in conformity with the plans and conditions
approved by the city. (Ord. 622, 9-2-1980)
10-19-11: LAPSE OF SITE PLAN APPROVAL:
A site plan approval shall lapse and shall become void one year following the date on which approval by the planning director, planning commission or city
council became effective unless, prior to the expiration of one year, a building permit is issued by the building official and construction is commenced and
diligently pursued toward completion of the site or structures which were the subject of the site plan. Approval may be extended for an additional period or
periods of one year upon written application to the planning director before expiration of the first approval. (Ord. 622, 9-2-1980)
10-19-12: REVOCATION:
The revocation of a site plan shall be governed by the provisions of section 10-18-14 of this title. (Ord. 622, 9-2-1980)
10-19-13: SITE PLAN APPROVAL TO RUN WITH THE LAND:
A site plan approved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall run with the land and shall continue to be valid upon a change of ownership of the site
which was the subject of the site plan. (Ord. 622, 9-2-1980)

1. That there are special circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved, such that strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the
specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties classified in the same zoning district.
2. That the granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties classified in the
vicinity and in the same zoning district.
B. The board may grant a variance to a regulation prescribed by this title, with respect to off street parking facilities or off street loading facilities as the
variance was applied for or in modified form, if, on the basis of the application, investigation and the evidence submitted, the commission makes the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 363/391
11-4-1: FILING OF MAP:
Whenever a tentative subdivision map or tentative parcel map is required to be filed, the subdivider may instead file a vesting tentative map. In such case,
the words "vesting tentative map" shall be printed conspicuously on the face of the map at the time of its filing. Except as expressly provided otherwise in
this chapter, the filing and processing of a vesting tentative map, including extension of the term thereof, shall be subject to all requirements for tentative
maps under chapter 2 of this title, or to tentative parcel maps under chapter 3 of this title, as applicable. (Ord. 2000-05, 4-25-2000)
11-4-2: RIGHTS OF MAP:
A. The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map in accordance with chapter 2 or 3 of this title, as applicable, shall confer a vested right to
proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards of the city in effect at the date the vesting tentative
map application is determined to be complete; provided, however, that if the city has initiated proceedings by means of ordinance, resolution or motion
to amend applicable plans or ordinances, and if the city has given notice of the proposed change as required by law, the city may apply any
ordinances, policies or standards resulting from such proceedings which are in effect on the date the city approves, conditionally approves or
disapproves the vesting tentative map.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, the city may condition or deny a permit, approval, extension or entitlement if it makes any
of the following determinations:
1. A failure to do so would place residents of the subdivision or parceled land or residents in the immediate community in a condition dangerous to their
health or safety, or both.
2. The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law.
C. The rights described in this section shall expire if a final map or a final parcel map is not approved by the city prior to the expiration of the vesting
tentative map. If the final map or a final parcel map is approved, these rights shall last for an initial time period of twelve (12) months from the date of
recording of the final map or final parcel map. Where several final maps or final parcel maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a
single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map or final parcel map for that phase is recorded.
D. The initial time period set forth under subsection C of this section shall be automatically extended by any time required by the city for the processing of
a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review for all or part of the development within the proposed subdivision or
area covered by the final parcel map, if such processing exceeds thirty (30) days from the date that a such complete grading permit or design or
architectural review application is filed.
E. At any time prior to the expiration of the initial time period described in subsection C of this section, a subdivider may apply for a one year extension of
such period. An application for an extension shall be submitted, in writing, to the department and shall state specifically those circumstances which are
or were beyond the ability of the applicant to control and which justify the request. The applicant shall have the burden of proving justification for the
extension of the initial time period. The planning commission may approve an application for an extension, may conditionally approve the application as
permitted by law, or may deny the application. If the application for extension is denied or conditionally approved, the applicant may appeal the denial
or conditional approval to the city council by filing a written appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days after the date of the planning commission
action. The appeal shall state, in writing, specifically why the applicant claims there was an error or abuse of discretion by the commission or why the
commission's decision is not supported by the preponderance of the evidence in the record.
The city council shall hear the appeal at its first regular meeting at which the matter may be legally heard following the close of the appeal period. The
applicant and any interested person shall be given an opportunity to be heard and present evidence. Upon close of the hearing, the city council may
affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the planning commission. If the city council reverses denial of the extension or modifies conditional approval of
the extension, the city council shall make findings in support of its decision.
F. If the applicant submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified under subsections C through E of this section,
the rights described in subsections A and B of this section shall continue until the expiration of the permit or any extension of the permit by the city.
(Ord. 2000-05, 4-25-2000)
11-4-3: AMENDMENTS TO MAP:
If the ordinances, policies or standards of the city are changed subsequent to the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map, the
subdivider or his assignee, at any time prior to expiration of the vesting tentative map, may apply for an amendment to the vesting tentative map to secure
vested rights to proceed with the changed ordinances, policies, or standards. The application shall be filed, in writing, with the community development
department and shall clearly specify the changed ordinances, policies, standards for which the amendment is sought. The application shall be reviewed
and processed in the same manner as a vesting tentative map application. (Ord. 2000-05, 4-25-2000)
11-4-4: EFFECT OF INCONSISTENT ZONING:
Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning code in existence at that
time, such inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The planning commission or city council may deny such vesting tentative map or approve it
conditioned on the subdivider, or the subdivider's designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning code to eliminate the inconsistency. If the
change in the zoning code is obtained, approval or conditional approval of the vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with
development, as described in section 11-4-2 of this chapter, in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning code and the map as approved. (Ord.
2000-05, 4-25-2000)

subsection 11-5-11G of this chapter, the following procedure and requirements shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of underground
easements and the installation of facilities for cable television (CATV) service:
A. The subdivider shall contact and survey all CATV operators who have received a franchise from the city pursuant to title 7, chapter 7 of this code to
ascertain which operators desire to provide CATV service to the subdivision. The subdivider may establish a reasonable deadline to receive CATV
operator responses. The final map or final parcel map, or in the case of residential projects not requiring a subdivision or parcel map, the final site plan
or (if none) final building plans, shall indicate the CATV operators that have agreed to serve the development.
B. If two (2) or more CATV operators wish to provide service, the subdivider shall accommodate them in a joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory
shared cost basis. If fewer than two (2) CATV operators indicate interest, the subdivider shall provide conduit to accommodate two (2) sets of CATV
cables and dedicate to the city any initially unoccupied conduit. The subdivider shall be entitled to recover the costs of installing such initially
unoccupied conduit if the city subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any CATV operator. Recovery of such costs shall be subject to
the terms, conditions and limitations of a written agreement between the subdivider and the city.
C. The subdivider shall provide at least ten (10) working days' written notice of the date that utility trenches will be open to the franchised CATV operators
that have agreed to serve the development. If a CATV operator does not reply to the subdivider within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, the
CATV operator shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to install its CATV facilities during the period the trenches are open. When the trenches
are open, CATV operators shall have two (2) working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five (5) working days after beginning installation
to complete installation.
D. For residential subdivisions, compliance with this section shall be imposed as a condition of approval of any tentative map or tentative parcel map. The
final map or final parcel map shall not be approved, or, for residential projects not requiring a subdivision map, the final site plan shall not be approved
or a building permit shall not be issued (whichever is applicable), until the subdivider or developer submits evidence that it has, or has agreed in a
subdivision agreement, parcel map agreement or other development agreement with the city that it will:
1. Notify each franchised CATV operator that underground utility trenches are to be open as of an estimated date, and that each franchised CATV
operator will be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual homes or home sites, on specified
nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
2. Pursuant to subsection C of this section, receive and accept a written reply from a CATV operator that it intends to install its facilities during the
period the trenches are open on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the subdivider
or the developer and CATV operator, subject to a CATV operator's waiver of such opportunity as provided in subsection C of this section.
E. Participating CATV operators shall share the joint utilities trench subject to compliance with state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such
compliance is not possible, the subdivider shall provide a separate trench for the television cables, with the entire cost shared among the subdivider
and participating CATV operators. With the concurrence of the subdivider, the affected utilities, CATV operators and the city engineer, alternative
installation procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law.
F. Any CATV operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated costs.
G. If the city grants an encroachment permit to an applicant for a CATV franchise to install conduit and/or cable pursuant to subsection 7-7-6E8 of this
code, the city may require the applicant to provide a separate trench for its conduit and/or cable, at the applicant's cost. The construction of such

C. Subsections A and B of this section do not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contract for sale or lease, or sold or
leased in compliance with or exempt from any law, including this title or other city ordinance, regulating subdivision design and improvements in effect
at the time the subdivision was established.
D. Nothing contained in either subsection A or B of this section shall prohibit an offer or contract to finance, lease or sell property or to construct
improvements thereon where the financing, lease or sale or the start of construction is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final map
or final parcel map as required by this title and the subdivision map act. (Ord. 2000-05, 4-25-2000)
11-11-2: REMEDIES:
A. Nothing in this chapter or in any other provision of this title shall bar any legal, equitable or summary remedy to which the city, any other public agency,
or any person, firm or corporation may otherwise be entitled. The city, such other public agency, or such person, firm or corporation may file a suit in
the superior court of Fresno County to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision or financing, lease or sale in violation of the subdivision
map act or this title.
B. The city shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a
division, in violation of the provisions of this title or the subdivision map act if the city finds that such development would be contrary to public health or
safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of record of the property at the
time of the violation or whether the applicant is the current owner of record of the property, or a vendee of the current owner of record pursuant to a
contract of sale for the property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of acquiring his interest in the property.
C. If the city issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any property subdivided, financed, sold or leased in violation of this title or the
subdivision map act, the city may impose those conditions which would have been applicable to division of the property at the time the applicant
acquired his interest in the property. However, if the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation, and by grant created a parcel
or parcels in violation of this title or the subdivision map act, the city may impose conditions applicable to a current division of the property. If a
conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record, only those conditions stipulated therein shall be applicable. (Ord. 2000-05, 4-25-2000)
11-11-3: CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE:
A. Request For Property Compliance: Any person owning real property or a vendee of that person under a contract of sale may request, in writing, the
community development director to determine, and the community development director shall determine, whether the property complies with the
provisions of this title and the subdivision map act.
B. Certificate Issued And Recorded: Upon making the determination that the property complies with this title and the subdivision map act, the community
development director shall issue a certificate of compliance and cause it to be filed for record with the county recorder.
The certificate of compliance shall identify the property and state that the division of land complies with this title and the subdivision map act.

this chapter. Upon making a determination and establishing the conditions, the city shall issue a conditional certificate of compliance and cause it to be
filed for record with the Fresno County recorder. The certificate shall serve as notice to property owner or vendee who has applied for the certificate, a
grantee of the property owner, and any transferee or assignee of the property, that the fulfillment and implementation of these conditions shall be
required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property. Compliance with the conditions shall not
be required until a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property is issued by the city.
D. Approval For Development: A certificate of compliance shall be issued for any property which has been approved for development pursuant to
subsection 11-11-2B of this chapter.

certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance to the city council. The appeal shall be filed, noticed, heard, and decided according to
the procedures, rules, burdens and requirements in section 11-2-8 of this title. (Ord. 2000-05, 4-25-2000)
11-11-4: NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
If the community development department has knowledge that property has been divided in violation of the provisions of this title or the subdivision map
act, a notice of intention to record a notice of violation shall be mailed by certified mail to the current owner of record. The notice shall describe the
property in detail, name the owner(s), describe the violation and state that an opportunity will be given to the owner(s) to present evidence. The notice
shall also contain an explanation of why the subject parcel is not lawful under subsection (a) or (b) of section 66412.6 of the subdivision map act. The
notice shall contain the date, time and place for a meeting at which time the owner(s) may present evidence to the community development director,
serving as advisory agency for this purpose, why a notice of violation should not be recorded.
The meeting shall take place no sooner than thirty (30) days and no later than sixty (60) days from the date of mailing. If the owner(s) of the property fails,
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a notice of violation, to inform the community development director in writing of objection to recording of the notice,
the director shall record the notice of violation with the county recorder. If, after the owner(s) have presented evidence, it is determined that there has been
no violation, the director shall mail a clearance letter to the current owner of record. If, however, after the owner(s) have presented evidence, the director
determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, the director shall record the notice of violation with the county recorder. (Ord. 2000-05, 4-25-
2000)

FLOOD CONTROL
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 381/391
Chapter 1
DEVELOPMENT IN FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
12-1-1: AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS; PURPOSE; METHODS:
A. Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state has in Government Code sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does hereby
adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
B. Findings Of Fact:
1. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss.
C. Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blighted areas caused by flood damage;
7. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
8. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.
D. Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. 95-001, 2-14-1995)
12-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

map, the flood boundary and floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD RELATED EROSION: The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by
waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water,
accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and
unforeseeable event which results in flooding.
FLOOD RELATED EROSION AREA MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood
related erosion damage including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood related erosion control works and floodplain management
regulations.
FLOOD RELATED EROSION AREA OR FLOOD RELATED EROSION PRONE AREA: A land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water
which, due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind driven currents, is likely to suffer flood related erosion damage.

FLOODWAY FRINGE: That area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.
FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION: As related to section 12-1-6 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the
public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 383/391
a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject,
during all those years, to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the
costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that
it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship
repair facilities, and does not include long term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
HARDSHIP: As related to section 12-1-6 of this chapter, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance.
The city requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as
a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is
more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is:
A. Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a listing maintained by the U.S. department of the interior) or preliminarily determined by
the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the national register;
B. Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a
district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;
C. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of
the interior; or
D. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an
approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or directly by the secretary of the interior in states with approved programs.
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain,
control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area (see definition of Basement) is not considered a building's lowest floor;
provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter. (Note:
This definition allows attached garages to be built at grade. Below grade garages are not allowed as they are considered to be basements.)
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent
or sale.
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum to which
base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final
site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community.
OBSTRUCTION: Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water,
or is likely to be carried downstream.
ONE HUNDRED YEAR OR 100-YEAR FLOOD: See definition of Base Flood.
PRIMARY FRONTAL DUNE: A continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately
landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the
primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope.
PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE: A structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use.
PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE: As related to section 12-1-6 of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is
injurious to safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use,
in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal or basin.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is:

FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, E, M.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred
eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include
the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, that is principally aboveground. This includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have
been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
B. Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or development without the elevation
certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation
is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified), of floods
of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

subsection E1 of this section.
F. Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 12-1-3B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
1. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement and other new development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 388/391
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
G. Flood Related Erosion Prone Areas:
1. The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood related erosion prone areas as
known to the community.
2. Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood
related erosion and will not cause flood related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard.
3. If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be
relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard.
4. Within zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from the riverfront or other body of water to create a
safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood related erosion hazard and
erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated useful life of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic and climatic
characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife
habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. (Ord. 95-001, 2-14-1995)
12-1-6: VARIANCE PROCEDURES; NATURE OF VARIANCES:
The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not
personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this
chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and
not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners.
It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built
below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare.
A. Appeal Board:
1. The city council shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. In passing upon requests for variances, the city
council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
a. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b. Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage, and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future
owners of the property;
d. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
f. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
g. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
i. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
k. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such
as sewer, gas, electrical and water system and streets and bridges.
2. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the city that:
a. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
b. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain
administrator in the office of the county recorder.
3. The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued
in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration of the federal emergency management agency.
B. Conditions For Variances:
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of
one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that
the procedures of sections 12-1-4 and 12-1-5 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 389/391
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of an historic structure, as defined in section 12-1-2 of this chapter, upon a determination that
the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
"Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. In the case of variances to an
elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. Showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship", as defined in section 12-1-2 of this chapter, to the applicant;
and
c. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public
expense; create a nuisance1, cause fraud or victimization of the public, as defined in section 12-1-2 of this chapter, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
6. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use; provided that the provisions of subsections B1 through B5 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and
does not create a public nuisance.
7. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection A5 of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 95-001, 2-14-1995)

the property or an increase of less than three thousand (3,000) square feet in covered area of the property, whichever is less, as a result of the
addition or accessory building construction. The increases in covered area referred to in this subsection shall be accumulative over the life of the
original improvements as they exist on the date of adoption hereof.
3. The reconstruction of an existing building which has been destroyed by fire or natural disaster, either partially or completely; provided that, based on
the covered area generated by the original building before said destruction, such reconstruction results in an increase of less than fifteen percent
(15%) in covered area of the property or an increase of less than three thousand (3,000) square feet in covered area of the property, whichever is
less.
4. Construction of a swimming pool, patio cover, driveway or driveway approach or construction, modification or enlargement of concrete or asphalt
surfaces all incidental to an existing single-family residential use.

incidental to an existing use other than single-family residential which results in an increase of less than fifteen percent (15%) in covered area or an
increase less than three thousand (3,000) square feet in covered area of the property, which ever is less. The increases in covered area referred to
in this subsection shall be accumulative over the life of the original improvements as they exist on the date of adoption hereof.
E. The charge shall be computed on the gross area of the property being improved, such area being defined as the parcel of land being developed or
redeveloped including half of all adjacent dedicated streets and alleys, and all of interior dedicated streets and alleys.
F. The charge shall be levied and payable to prior to issuance of a building permit, approval of conditional use permit or approval of final map, or parcel
map, whichever comes first. (Ord. 652, 2-2-1982)
12-2-6: CONSTRUCTION FUND:
There is hereby established and set up a storm drainage construction fund. All money collected from the storm drainage systems acreage charge shall be
placed in said fund and disbursed therefrom to reimburse the city for construction of storm drainage systems, to provide the city with funds for construction
of storm drainage systems and to reimburse others who have constructed or advanced the construction of storm drainage systems as provided for in this
chapter. All interest earned on monies deposited in the fund shall be retained in the fund. (Ord. 652, 2-2-1982)
12-2-7: FEASIBILITY OF FUNDING AND/OR CONSTRUCTION:

6/3/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=564 391/391
12-2-8: FUNDING AND/OR CONSTRUCTION, NOT FEASIBLE:
If, in the opinion of the city council, construction of a storm drainage system is not feasible because the construction fund and/or the charges to be
collected are insufficient to guarantee the construction of the storm drainage system, then the city council may pass a resolution in accordance with one of
the following:
A. That the request, development or redevelopment is premature to the basic development or redevelopment of the general area as a whole and that such
request, development or redevelopment is denied or held in abeyance.
B. That in the case of development or redevelopment that the developer or redeveloper pay such charges due as set forth in this chapter and detain on
site all stormwater runoff from said development or redevelopment by means or methods approved by the city engineer in such a way as to not cause
any damage to properties receiving stormwater overflows.
C. The requested development or redevelopment necessitates a storm drainage system and that the construction thereof is not feasible only because the
construction fund and/or the charges to be collected are deemed insufficient as set forth herein, and therefore, said property owner, developer or
redeveloper may pay such charges due as set forth in this chapter and construct or advance the cost of construction of the storm drainage system and
