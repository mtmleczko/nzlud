PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1963 Code, as supplemented through 1983, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1963 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 9 is numbered 9-1 and the tenth section of Chapter 4 is 4-10. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-2 and 3-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-2.1, 3-2.2 and 3-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of B. Meade White of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance through the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to the officials of the city for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

    The mayor and council of said city shall have the power and authority at any time, whenever in the judgement of said mayor and council the paving originally laid on any street or alley is worn out to such extent that it is no longer useful or good pavement, to repave such street or alley, or cause same to be repaved, and to carry into effect the authority herein granted, the said mayor and council shall have full power and authority to assess fifty (50) per cent of the actual total cost of repaving said street or alley against the real estate abutting on each side of said street or alley, upon which said work is done, and the owners thereof, in just proportions to the frontage by the foot of said property, that is, twenty-five (25) per cent of the total cost of such repaving shall be assessed against the real estate abutting on one side of said street or alley, and twenty-five (25) per cent of the total cost of such repaving shall be assessed against the opposite side of said street or alley. The city shall pay fifty (50) per cent of the total cost of such repaving. Provided, however, that corner property shall be assessed as follows: (a) where the repaving abuts property only on the front, the property shall be assessed for the amount of frontage, and (b) where the repaving abuts property on both the front and the side, the property shall be assessed for the frontage and for the side, but one hundred (100) feet of the side shall be exempted from assessment, and (c) where the repaving abuts property only on the side, the side shall be assessed, but one hundred (100) feet of the side shall be exempted from assessment. 
    The mayor and council shall have full power and authority to determine the manner, materials and methods to be employed in the repaving, curbing or guttering of any street.

    When such repaving has been completed, the mayor and council shall adopt an ordinance assessing and apportioning the actual total cost thereof in just proportions to the frontage by the foot against the abutting real estate, as provided in this section of this Act. The cost of such repaving shall not constitute a lien against the abutting real estate until the work has been completed and an ordinance has been adopted assessing the costs thereof, but after such time said assessments shall constitute a lien against the abutting real estate superior to all other liens except liens for taxes, and such liens shall be enforceable, and the assessments collectable by execution in the same manner as provided for the collection of delinquent taxes due the city.

Corner property shall be assessed and exempted in the same manner as corner property is assessed and exempted for street repaving, as provided in section 1 of this Act [section 9-1].

Said mayor and council shall in all cases, in their discretion, have the power to grant a stay of execution for said assessment for such times as they may see fit, and collect the interest on the same at the rate of seven (7) per cent per annum. 
(S. B. No. 289, § 3-10-64) 
Sec. 9-4. - Transfer of liens and assessments. 
    The city shall have the right, power and authority to sell and transfer all such liens and assessments at their full value plus accrued interest, and the purchasers or transferees of such liens and assessments shall be protected by the same lien and to the same extent and in the same manner as said city was protected prior to such sale or transfer of such liens. Nothing in this section shall deprive any abutting lot owner of the right to pay his or her pro rata share of the cost of such improvement in cash at or before completion of the work.

    City. The terms "the city" and "this city" shall mean the City of College Park, Georgia. 
    Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or an act to be done, a certain length of time before any proceeding shall be had, the day on which such notice is given, or such act is done, shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which such proceeding is to be had shall not be counted. 
    County. The terms "the county" and "this county" shall mean the County of Fulton or the County of Clayton, or both, whichever is proper in the circumstances. 
    Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department or other officer or employee of the city to do the same act or make certain inspections it is to be construed to authorize the head of the department or other officer or employee to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to perform the required act or make the required inspection unless the terms of the provision or section designate otherwise.

    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, it shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of the Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the general provision imposed by the Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling.

State Law reference- Rules of construction and definitions, O.C.G.A. §§ 1-3-1-1-3-3. 
Sec. 1-3. - Catchlines of section. 
    The catchlines of the several sections of the Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or re-enacted. 
Sec. 1-4. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
    The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinances in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect. 
    The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising under the ordinance repealed. 
(Code 1963, § 1-4) 
Sec. 1-5. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contractor or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the governing body. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts or ordinances passed by the governing body or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. Charter amendments will be included in like manner. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them in a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing sections or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-6. - Amendments to code; amendatory language. 
    All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. 
    Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section _______ of the city Code is hereby amended to read as follows:..." The new provisions may then be set out in full as desired. 
    In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "That the city Code is hereby amended by adding a section (or article or chapter) to be numbered _______, which said section reads as follows:..." The new section may then be set out in full as desired. 
    All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the case may be. 
Sec. 1-7. - Altering code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever except by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the governing body, which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
Sec. 1-8. - General penalty; continuing violations. 
    Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment in the city jail for not more than one hundred and eighty (180) days, or work in the workgang on the public streets or on such public works as the authorities may employ the workgang for not more than thirty (30) days, or by any one or more of these punishments, subject to all limitations contained in the Charter of the City. Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
    However, unless otherwise specifically authorized by another city ordinance, the city judge, after prescribing a determinate jail sentence in days or months (if imprisonment is imposed), may not sentence a defendant to serve actual time in the city jail without first considering the extenuating and aggravating factors surrounding the case and the circumstances affecting the individual defendant. In fact, the city judge may suspend any and all jail time where a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment in the city jail if the imposition of such sentence, at the discretion of the judge, will not serve the interest of justice. 
    In exercising his or her discretion, when determining whether imprisonment of the defendant is in the best interest of justice, the city judge shall consider the extenuating and aggravating factors and circumstances surrounding the case and the individual defendant. Aggravating factors include, but are not limited to, the amount of damages caused by the defendant's actions to third parties, whether the defendant is a multiple offender, whether the defendant has prior criminal convictions, whether the defendant is employed, and such similar factors. Extenuating circumstances shall include, but are not limited to, whether the defendant is a first time offender, whether the defendant has repaired and/or repaid any damages caused as a result of his or her actions, whether the defendant is employed and has the ability to pay a fine, and such similar factors. 
    In addition to the penalties hereinabove provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated by the city as provided by law, and each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.

Sec. 1-8.1. - Legislative findings and purpose. 
    It is the finding of the mayor and council that it is in the best interest of justice that in those cases where a defendant or defendants enter a guilty plea or are found guilty of violating a city ordinance, that they be punished by the imposition of a fine rather than by imprisonment in the city jail. The mayor and council further find that the punishment of imprisonment should be used at the discretion of the judge in those cases in which, under the facts of the case and the circumstances surrounding the individual defendant, a fine may not be the appropriate punishment. The mayor and council further find that there should be guidelines for the judge to help him/her determine whether or not imprisonment is the appropriate punishment under the circumstances of the case after a defendant enters a guilty plea or is found guilty of violating a city ordinance. 
    Accordingly, the mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to provide guidelines for the imposition of the punishment of imprisonment in the city jail provided by section 1-8 of this Code of Ordinances. It is a matter of governmental interest and concern and in the interest of the public welfare to use the punishment of imprisonment in those cases in which the court, in its discretion and under the circumstances of the case, considers this punishment fitting in order to properly enforce the city ordinances. To that end, the ordinance from which this section derives is hereby adopted. 
    This ordinance is not intended as a de facto prohibition of the judge's discretion. This ordinance is intended to guide that discretion given to the judge by section 7-8 of the City Charter.

(Ord. No. 2016-32, § III, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 5-173. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 5-173(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsection 5-173(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 5-174(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. Tit. 12, Ch. 5, Pt. 6, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. Tit. 12, Ch. 5, Art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(17)  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. Tit. 12, Ch. 5 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 5-173(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2016-32, § IV, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 5-174. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of College Park without first obtaining a permit from the engineering director to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the engineering director and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 5-174(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 5-173(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two (2) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 5-173(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 5-174(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 5-173(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsection 5-173(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 5-174(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 2016-32, § V, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 5-175. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The certified inspector will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The certified inspector shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Ord. No. 2016-32, § VI, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 5-176. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; and 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.

Sec. 5-299.36. - Variance procedures. 
    The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. 
(1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the city engineer. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city engineer. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city engineer shall have the right to appeal such decision to the mayor and council as established by the city in accordance with procedures adopted by the mayor and council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the mayor and council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Fulton County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the city engineer and the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(8)  Conditions for variances. 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property , and that such costs may be as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage provided. 
d.  The city engineer shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city engineer and mayor and council shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city engineer and the mayor and council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article. 
(11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

(Ord. No. 2006-27, § 1, 9-18-06) 
DIVISION 2. - LAND DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 5-307. - Buffer and setback requirements. 
    All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for fifty (50) feet, measured horizontally, on both banks, as applicable, of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank; 
(b)  An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback; and 
(c)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
(Ord. No. 2006-27, § 1, 9-18-06) 
Sec. 5-308. - Variance procedures. 
(1)  Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(a)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the EPD finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the EPD may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel; and 
(b)  Except as provided above, the EPD shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the EPD. The EPD shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The EPD shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
(2)  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
(a)  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions, existing at the time of the adoption of this article, prevents land development, unless a buffer variance is granted; 
(b)  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the article would create an extreme hardship. Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property; 
(3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
(a)  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
(b)  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
(c)  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
(d)  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
(e)  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
(f)  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
(g)  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
(h)  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
(a)  The shape, size topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
(b)  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
(c)  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
(d)  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
(e)  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
(f)  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective as natural resources and the environment.

(b)  All property located within the boundaries set forth in subsection (a) above, shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01) 
Sec. 5-331. - Site development standards. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of these site development standards is to establish minimum standards for improvements to downtown properties. The purpose of these standards is to foster attractive development promoting consistency in design and materials, while recognizing the overall design of the downtown area as one of zero lot line development with shared public parking. 
(b)  Vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems. 
(1)  All new construction shall provide for sidewalks installed along public rights-of-way of no less than eight (8) feet in width, linking such site with adjacent sidewalks throughout the Downtown Business District. 
(2)  Drive-in windows for commercial uses shall not be located on a building's principal facade and shall be shielded from view from the street on which the building fronts. 
(3)  Curb-cuts for driveway installations shall be approved by the city engineering department and shall comply with city safety standards for distance from adjacent driveways and from the intersection of nearby public rights-of-way. 
(c)  Loading areas. Loading areas shall be completely screened from view from the right-of-way on which the building faces. Where new construction permits sufficient space, loading areas shall be completely screened from view of users of public rights-of-way by masonry or stone walls, opaque fences or continuous vegetative buffers. Vegetative buffers shall be comprised of shrubs and tree species having dense foliage and of such size and spacing so as to form a continuous visual screen within two (2) years of installation of plant materials. 
(d)  Site lighting. 
(1)  All parking areas and walk-ways shall provide area lighting sufficient to achieve a minimum illumination of two and four-tenths (2.4) foot candles of light as measured at grade or ground level and recommended in the ISNA Lighting Handbook. 
(2)  Lighting fixture height, style, design and illumination levels shall be compatible with the building design and height and shall consider safety, function and aesthetics. 
(3)  Lighting shall be designed to prevent glare on adjacent properties, whether public or private.

    Many businesses in College Park originally had cloth or metal awnings to protect customers and merchandise from the elements. The use of traditional cloth or canvas awnings is permitted and encouraged. Awnings should be made of opaque material; i.e., canvas. 
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01) 
Sec. 5-333. - Windows. 
    Original windows are an important character-defining element. The shape of openings, the type of windows, and of light divisions (number of panes), are very important to the character of buildings. Owners wishing to replace windows should meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Many old windows can be repaired rather than replaced. Repair should always be the first choice. 
(2)  If new windows are required, they should require no major alterations of the opening. 
(3)  New windows should match the original materials or replicate the same appearance. Wood windows, for example, should replace the original wood, metal should replace metal, and if the original wooden windows have been replaced with metal, wooden windows should replace the second-generation metal windows. 
(4)  New windows should match the pane divisions of the original windows. For example, multi-paned sash windows should not be installed in buildings that originally had one over one sashes. 
(5)  Care should be taken to obtain windows that fit original casings. In these cases, where possible, replacement sash rather than replacement of whole windows should be adhered to. 
(6)  Bay windows are out of character in the Downtown Business District and therein shall not be located on the front of buildings or on facades visible from any public street. 
(Ord. No. 2001-18, § 1, 5-21-01) 
Sec. 5-334. - Storm windows and doors.

(1)  Storm windows and doors should have minimal impact on building facades. Owners should consider proper weather-stripping and repairs first as an alternative to installation of storm doors and windows. 
(2)  New storm doors and windows must match the color of the existing sash wherever possible. 
(3)  Clear panes are recommended for storm doors which permit the original door to be fully visible.

(e)  Any additional franchise granted by the city to provide cable service in a part of the city in which a franchise has already been granted and where an existing grantee is providing service shall require the new grantee to provide service throughout its service area within a reasonable time and in a sequence which does not discriminate against lower income residents.

Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise and/or cable system without the consent of the council shall be null and void. This provision shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. No consent from the city shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a corporation, partnership, subsidiary or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with grantee; provided that any such intercorporate transfer shall be reported to the city and grantee shall be responsible for providing the city with current information on names and addresses of responsible persons following any such transfer.

(1)  The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of grantee's assets; 
(2)  The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interests in grantee by one (1) or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in grantee;

(c)  Except as provided below, no grantee may sell or otherwise transfer ownership in a franchise and/or cable system within a thirty-six-month period following either the acquisition or initial construction of said system by grantee. In the case of a sale of multiple systems, if the terms of the sale require the buyer to subsequently transfer ownership of one (1) or more such systems to one (1) or more third parties, such transfer shall be considered a part of the initial transaction. The above-described thirty-six-month holding period shall not apply to: 
(1)  Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise and/or cable system which is not subject to federal income tax liability; 
(2)  Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency, and state or political subdivision or the city; or 
(3)  Any sale, assignment, or transfer, to one (1) or more purchasers, assignees, or transferees controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, the seller, assignor, or transferor.

It the city fails to render a final decision on the request within one hundred twenty (120) days from receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension time. 
(e)  Grantee shall notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale or other termination of all or a substantial part of the cable system of the grantee. Such notification shall be considered by the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of the city to such change in control of ownership shall apply. 
(f)  For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee shall cooperate with the city in any such inquiry. No consent of the city shall be given in the absence of the transferee completing an application in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the city, which application shall include the information required under local, state and federal law as well as under section 5.5-6 of this chapter and indicating compliance with the terms of this chapter, state and federal law. An application, acceptable to the city, shall be submitted to the city not less than ninety (90) days prior to the date of proposed transfer. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and maintain the cable system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If, after considering the legal, financial, character and technical qualities of the proposed transferee and determining that they are satisfactory, the city finds that such transfer is acceptable, the city shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise to the proposed transferee. The consent of the city to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied. 
(g)  Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or a grantee's assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it or its designee satisfactory to the city shall take control of and operate the cable television system, in the event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation within thirty (30) days of assuming such control that will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the cable system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the cable system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the city in its discretion and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another grantee.

(c)  In those areas of the city where a grantee's cables are located on the above ground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone and electric power service and in the event that the facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are placed underground, then the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost, provided that grantee may request a waiver, in writing, of the requirement for underground placement where such underground placement would be technologically unfeasible. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in above-ground closures. 
(d)  If the grades or lines of the street within the service area are changed at any time during the term of a franchise, then the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city, protect or promptly alter or relocate the cable system, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event that the grantee refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the cable system, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the cable system without any liability to the city and the grantee shall pay to the city all costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alternation, or relocation. 
(e)  In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade, or removal of the cable system, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city and all designated landmarks. The grantee agrees that it shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair and restore to its previous serviceable condition, in a manner as may be specified by the city, any street or municipal structure involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the cable system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of the grantee. 
(f)  In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade, or removal of the cable system, the grantee shall not obstruct the streets, railways, passenger travel, river navigation, or other traffic to, from, or within the service area without prior consent of the city and any other appropriate authorities. All such work shall be performed so as to cause minimal interference with users of the streets and adjoining property owners. 
(g)  The company shall, upon prior written notice by the city or any person holding a permit to move any structure, temporarily move its wires to permit the moving of said structure. The grantee may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the city for any such movement of its wires. 
(h)  The grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences, barricades, watchmen, and suitable and sufficient lighting. 
(i)  The city may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster, or other emergency, as determined by the city, in its sole discretion, cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the cable system, in which event the city shall not incur any liability to the grantee, any affiliated person or any other person. When possible, the grantee shall be consulted prior to any such cutting or movement of its wires and be given the opportunity to perform such work itself. All costs to repair or replace such wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances or other parts of the cable system shall be borne by the grantee. This provision shall not apply to routine work performed by the city or other supplier of private utilities unless an actual emergency arises during the course of that work.

(k)  Erection, removal, and common uses of poles. 
(1)  No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without first having entered into a pole attachment agreement with the city. However, no location of any pole or wireholding structure of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the council determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(2)  Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the city are available for use by the grantee on reasonable terms, the council may require the grantee to use such poles and structures. If a grantee believes the terms with a private supplier to be unreasonable, it may apply, in writing, to the city for a waiver of this requirement. 
(3)  Where the city or a public utility serving the city desires to make use of the poles or other wire holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the council may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the council shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the council determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations.

(g)  Grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the public.

Upon such request for payment, the city shall notify the grantee of the amount and date thereof. 
(d)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the letter of credit are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any other right the city may have.

(a)  Fire lane access to buildings by fire apparatus referred to in the fire prevention code are hereby established as follows: All premises which the fire department may be called upon to protect in case of fire, and which are not readily accessible from public roads, shall be provided with suitable gates, access roads, and fire lanes so that all buildings on the premises are readily accessible to fire apparatus. All exposures within the city (except single-and two-family dwellings) shall have fire apparatus access to a public thoroughfare a minimum width of twenty (20) feet, as approved by the fire marshal on at least one side of the exposure. Access to alternate sides of the exposure shall be provided for fire apparatus in cases where more than two hundred (200) feet of hose lay, as measured from the access side of the exposure, would be required to reach the far side of the exposure. Hose lay may be increased to four hundred (400) feet, provided the exposure has a total sprinkler system. All access requirements shall be approved by the fire marshal. 
(b)  These lanes shall be established on private property, devoted to public use, where the parking of motor vehicles or other obstructions can interfere with the ingress and egress of fire department vehicles for the protection of persons and property, such as at shopping centers, bowling lanes, theaters, hospitals, churches, and similar locations. The width and route of such lanes shall be specifically determined by the city. 
(c)  The marking of fire lanes on private property devoted to public use, shall be approved by the chief of the fire department and the chief of the police department. When it is determined that fire lanes are needed, the designation of the area as a fire lane shall be prepared with a description of the area. Copies of the description and the designation shall be signed by the fire chief and the police chief and shall be filed in the city clerk's office. Marking of the fire lanes shall be done by installing a "no parking, fire lane" sign, and the owner of the location shall provide yellow markings on the street and curb to identify the fire lane area. Markings shall be as determined by the fire chief. The fire chief may waive the requirement for yellow markings on the curb, but not on the street, upon a showing to his or her professional satisfaction that yellow markings on the street alone will be so designed as to provide an equal level of protection of the safety of the public as yellow markings on both the curb and the street. 
(d)  Parking of motor vehicles obstructing fire lanes shall be prohibited. 
(e)  Any person who shall park in a designated fire lane, in violation of the markings at said location, shall, upon the entering of a plea of guilty, nolo contendere, or a finding of guilty, be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00).

(d)  Fire hydrants installed in multiple housing developments shall be spaced a maximum of five hundred (500) feet apart and located in such a way as to permit hose lays of no more than four hundred (400) feet. Should it become necessary for the city to place hydrants on private property to meet the above requirements, the owners of said properties so serviced shall be required to maintain said hydrants according to the specifications of the city. 
(e)  Fire hydrants installed by private companies and individuals must comply with installation specifications of the city. 
(f)  All owners of private property, including owners of multi-family structures, within the city, with existing exposures which do not meet the current code requirements for fire hydrants and water main installations, shall be required to meet the following minimum standards:

(c)  In those areas of the city where a grantee's cables or facilities are located on the above-ground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone, electric power, or other service, and in the event that the facilities of such public utilities subsequently are placed underground, then the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost, provided that grantee may request a waiver, in writing, of the requirement for underground placement where such underground placement would be technologically unfeasible. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in above-ground closures. 
(d)  If the grades, lines or right-of-way of any street within the service area are changed at any time during the term of a franchise, then the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades, lines, or right-of-way. In the event that the grantee refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the city and the grantee shall pay to the city all costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alternation, or relocation.

The city also reserves the right to inspect the installation and maintenance of grantee's facilities in or on the city's property. 
(f)  The grantee shall provide as-built drawings, acceptable to the city detailing the number and location of facilities installed pursuant to this chapter. The number and location of facilities may be reasonably regulated as set forth in this chapter.

The grantee agrees that it shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair and restore to its previous serviceable condition, in a manner as may be specified by the city, any street or any municipal structure involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the facilities that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of the grantee. 
(i)  In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade, or removal of the facility, the grantee shall not obstruct the streets, railways, passenger travel, river navigation, or other traffic to, from, or within the public rights-of-way without prior consent of the city and any other appropriate authorities. All such work shall be performed so as to cause minimal interference with users of the streets and adjoining property owners. 
(j)  The grantee shall, upon prior written notice by the city or any person holding a permit to move any structure, temporarily move its wires to permit the moving of said structure. The grantee may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the city for any such movement of its wires. However, imposition of such a charge shall not be deemed to constitute an easement benefiting grantee.

(l)  Erection, removal and common uses of poles. 
(1)  No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without first having entered into a pole attachment agreement with the city. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the council determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby.

(d)  In the event the person or entity fully liable for all monetary obligations arising from the city's provision of a utility service to a property fails to remit to the city monies for all amounts shown on the bill required by subsection (a) before 11:59 p.m. on the seventh (7 th ) calendar day after the past due date indicated on such bill, the city shall have the right, pursuant to section 10-13(b), to discontinue the utility service. In addition to the right to discontinue such service, the failure to remit to the city all amounts shown on such bill by 11:59 p.m. on the seventh (7 th ) calendar day after the past due date indicated on the utility service bill shall result in the imposition by the city of an administrative charge as determined by resolution of the mayor and council. The purpose of such administrative charge is to defray the cost to the city of identifying, and monitoring delinquent accounts. 
(e)  (1)  For a period of four (4) years after the date of each bill issued on an account established for the provision of utility service, the city shall maintain a record of each such bill. Said record shall indicate the date of the bill; the date the bill was issued; the name and mailing address of the person or entity to whom the bill was sent; the amount owed under the bill, any prior, unpaid balance owed upon the account prior to the issuance of the bill; and any payments or credits reflected upon the bill. Said record shall also include any information as to whether any bill was returned to the city due to the inability of the mail carrier to deliver such item to the listed mailing address or any information indicating any other delivery issue. 
(2)  Where the city's records show a bill was issued to the person or entity fully liable for all monetary obligations arising from the provision of the utility service at the current mailing address provided to the city by such person or entity and said records do not indicate the bill was returned by the mail carrier as undelivered or any other delivery issue, a rebuttable presumption arises that such bill was actually received by the person or entity fully liable for said monetary obligations within five (5) calendar days after the date the bill was issued.

Should the results of the check show the meter to be functioning accurately and in accordance with the city's standards, the deposit will be forfeited by the customer. Should the results of the check show the registration of the meter to be in error in excess of the city's standards or show the meter is registering more utility than actually is passing through that device, the city will refund the deposit to the customer. 
(c)  Repair or replacement of meter. If the results of the meter test performed by the city under this section show the registration of the meter to be in error in excess of the city's standards or show the meter is registering more utility than actually is passing through the device, the city shall repair or replace the meter at no charge to the customer.

e.  Any other ground for which the administrator, in his/her discretion, determines that an adjustment is appropriate and that the grant of such adjustment would not violate any provision of this article or any other ordinance of the city. 
(3)  The following conditions and restrictions shall apply to any administrative adjustment sought under subsection (a)(2)d.: 
a.  No administrative adjustment may be granted for excessive water loss due solely to a faulty or malfunctioning faucet, spigot or toilet. 
b.  To be eligible for such adjustment, the requestor must submit to the administrator documentation or other evidence establishing that the faulty water heater, the faulty meter or the water pipe leak that caused the excessive water loss has been repaired. 
c.  In determining the monetary amount of any administrative adjustment, the administrator may not consider account information or charges on any account statement that was issued by the city more than six (6) months before the date of the bill in issue. 
(4)  Individual financial hardship. In the case of individual financial hardship, the requestor may obtain an administrative adjustment that extends (for a maximum of six (6) months) the period in which the requestor may have to remit to the city the full amount due under a utility service account. The administrator may grant an administrative adjustment due to a requestor's individual financial hardship under the following terms:

c.  A requestor may obtain only one (1) administrative adjustment due to an individual financial hardship in any twelve-month period. 
(5)  Medical condition.

The administrator may grant an administrative adjustment due to such medical condition under the following terms: 
a.  The requestor can obtain only an extension of the time in which to pay and cannot obtain a reduction of any charge (other than penalties assessed under section 10-5(c)).

(1)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, the submission of a written request for an administrative adjustment does not automatically extend the due date for the full payment of all charges and assessments shown on a bill or relieve the requestor from the monetary obligation for any such charge or assessment. Notwithstanding a pending written adjustment request, the failure to timely remit full payment for all charges and assessments shown on a bill shall be grounds for the involuntary discontinuance of utility service under section 10-13(b). The administrator has the discretion to waive the requirements of this subsection and to set a new due date for the full payment. 
(2)  Where the written request for an administrative adjustment is sought under subsection (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, the due date for the full payment of all charges and assessments for the adjustment is sought shall be automatically extended until seven (7) days after the date the administrator's decision on the request.

(2)  If applicable, determine the amount of any necessary credits toward a future charge or assessment for an excess monies received pursuant to subsection (c); 
(3)  If applicable, establish a schedule for the payment of all outstanding balances; and 
(4)  If applicable, waive accumulated interest and penalties. 
The decision of the administrator under this subsection shall be dated, in writing, and delivered to the requestor at the mailing address shown in the city's records.

Secs. 10-167-10-169. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 5. - STORMWATER UTILITY. 

Sec. 10-170. - Findings. 
    The mayor and council of the City of College Park make the following findings: 
(a)  Stormwater management is needed throughout the city limits. While specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within City of College Park is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(b)  Addressing the stormwater management needs in the city is essential to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. The provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of City of College Park in a variety of ways. 
(c)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding, stream bank and ditch erosion, property damage and degradation of water quality, aquatic habitat and biological communities. Failure to manage these impacts can put the city's ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk. 
(d)  The volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property, therefore, the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees. 
(e)  The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge. 
(f)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for Stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
(g)  The City of College Park presently owns and operates stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, there must be adequate and stable funding for the city's stormwater management program's operating needs and capital. 
(h)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city engineer. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the stormwater contribution from the property benefited by such systems. 
(i)  As a result, the city's governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and the city's governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding storm water management services in the city.

(c)  Other developed land and groups of detached single-family dwelling units or improvements on other developed land which are developed as part of a common development plan which includes within the development, but not on the lots on which the detached single-family dwelling units or the improvements on other developed land are located, privately owned, maintained or operated stormwater control systems, facilities, assets, services or activities that reduce the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities, may receive a credit based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the stormwater service charge credit technical manual. The stormwater service charge credit for privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site stormwater control systems, facilities or assets that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property may be up to 50 percent of the stormwater service charge applicable to the property, and shall be proportional to the extent that such stormwater control systems, facilities or assets provided, operated and maintained by private persons may reduce or mitigate the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities. The credit for services and activities that reduce or mitigate the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities shall be proportional to the reduced costs realized by the city stormwater utility, but shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the person providing such services and activities, and shall not exceed 50 percent of the Stormwater service charge applicable to the subject property. 
(d)  In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city engineer on forms provided for such purpose. When the city engineer deems an application for a credit complete, the city manager will then issue a decision granting the credit in whole or in part, or denying the credit within thirty (30) days thereafter. Credits applied for by the property owner in fiscal year 2008, and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater service charges accruing in fiscal year 2008. Beginning July 1, 2008 credits applied for by the property owner, and granted in whole or in part, shall apply from the first day of the calendar month immediately following the date on which a complete application for the credit has been filed with the city. 
(e)  A property owner shall not have to reapply annually for the credit granted, but the city engineer may review the credit and the basis therefore no more frequently than annually, and may terminate the credit if he finds grounds therefore. If such credit is terminated, the property owner may appeal such determination pursuant to section 10-175, or may, if possible, correct the deficiencies which caused the termination and reapply for the credit. A property owner with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, however, must submit the report prescribed in the NPDES permit to the city engineer to continue to receive the credit from the city associated with the NPDES permit. 
(f)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on (1) continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as may be updated or amended from time to time; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this division. 
(g)  Stormwater utility fees may be adjusted retroactively to the date that the city received the completed application. 
(h)  A customer shall reapply every five (5) years for the credit granted, however, the city may terminate the credit if city finds the facility does not comply with the original approved credit application. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 6-18-07) 
Sec. 10-182. - Inspection of private facilities. 
    Continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards may be verified by the city's inspection of the systems or facilities upon which the credit is based. No credit shall be given under this article unless the property owner agrees in writing in its application that the city shall have the right for its designated officers, representatives, agents, and employees to enter upon private and public property, upon reasonable notice to the owner of such property, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering testing, on such property in order to assure compliance with the design and performance standards and the applicant's credit application. On-site systems or facilities determined to no longer comply with the county's design and performance standards or the applicant's original credit application shall subject the property owner to revocation of all, or a portion of, stormwater service charge credits based on the city inspectors' estimate of capacity reduction for a period of not less than one (1) year.

The Director shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the Director shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors. 
(c)  Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: 
(1)  When the director determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; 
(2)  when a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or 
(3)  When notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record. 
(d)  The notice of violation shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: Notice of Violation-Name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the Director that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this ordinance; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the City to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense. 
(e)  Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with the city for a hearing before the director to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance. 
(f)  Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Fulton/Clayton County. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this mArticle, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.

(d)  The occupation tax clerk shall classify the entire gross receipts of the applicant by the dominant line or product of the applicant. 
(e)  Where the gross receipts of a business or practitioner do not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) in a year, or where federal or state law precludes the imposition of a gross receipts taxes on a particular class of business, trade, occupation or profession, including but not limited to the airline industry, which business, trade or occupation is otherwise subject to taxation by the city, such occupation tax levied shall be based only upon the number of employees of the business or practitioner and the administrative fee. 
(f)  Real estate brokers, agents, or companies that sell real property located in the city but that do not maintain a principal or branch office within the city shall only have taxes levied upon them based on the administrative fee and profitability ratios in combination with gross receipts. 
(g)  (1)  No business or practitioner shall be required to pay more than one (1) occupation tax for each of its locations. 
(2)  No occupation tax will be required upon more than one hundred (100) per cent of a business's gross receipts.

(5)  An occupation tax shall not be levied in any manner other than that described in this section. 
(6)  Occupation taxes are limited to the gross receipts earned in the taxing jurisdiction or in the state. 
(7)  Out-of-state businesses with no location in Georgia shall be assessed occupation taxes based on the gross receipts of the business, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-7, which are reasonably attributable to sales or services in the state. 
(Ord. No. 2013-13, § 1, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 11-7. - Paying occupation tax of business with no location in Georgia: exemption for tax paid in other state. 
(a)  Registration and assessment of an occupation tax is hereby imposed on those businesses and practitioners of professions with no location or office in the state if the business's largest dollar volume of business in Georgia is in the city and the business or practitioner: 
(1)  Has one (1) or more employees or agents who exert substantial efforts within the jurisdiction of the city for the purpose of soliciting business or serving customers or clients; or 
(2)  Owns personal or real property which generates income and which is located within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(b)  Any business or practitioner of a profession with no location or office in the state shall be exempt from assessment of an occupation tax under this article if such business or practitioner submits proof of payment of a local business or occupation tax in another state on the business's or practitioner's sales or services in the state. 
(Ord. No. 2013-13, § 1, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 11-8. - Professionals as classified in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-9(c).

(2)  A fee per practitioner with an office or location in the city who is licensed to provide the service; provided, however, that a practitioner paying according to this paragraph shall not be required to provide information to the local government relating to the gross receipts of the business or practitioner. The per-practitioner fee applies to each person employed by the business who qualifies as a practitioner under the state's regulatory guidelines and framework. The fee referenced above shall be established by the mayor and council by resolution from time to time. 
(b)  This election is to be made on an annual basis and must be done March 31 of each year. If no election is made, the tax shall be levied as if subsection (a)(2) above were elected. 
(c)  It is the intention of the mayor and council that no portion of this taxation plan be construed to be, or have the practical effect of, regulation of or a precondition on the practice of state regulated professions. If any provision hereof shall be construed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be an unlawful regulation of such profession, then such provision shall be considered rescinded by the mayor and council as if such provision had not been adopted, and in such case, the remaining provisions of this article shall be applied to such practitioner. 
(Ord. No. 2013-13, § 1, 11-4-13; Ord. No. 2014-20, § 3, 10-20-14)

(Ord. No. 2013-13, § 1, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 11-10. - When tax due and payable; effect of transacting business when tax delinquent.

If the occupation tax is not paid by April 1 of each year, a ten (10) per cent penalty will be assessed on the tax or fee due. On any new trade, profession or occupation begun in the city, the occupation tax return and tax shall be delinquent if not obtained thirty (30) days after commencement of the business. An administrative fee will accrue at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) per cent per month on the entire unpaid balance and a ten (10) per cent penalty shall be imposed if the balance due is not paid ninety (90) days from the due date. 
(b)  Except for practitioners of professions and occupations, upon filling an occupation tax return and paying all due taxes, fees and penalties, an occupation tax certificate shall be issued by the occupation tax clerk. If any person, firm, or corporation whose duty it is to obtain an occupation tax certificate shall, after said occupation tax becomes delinquent, transact or offer to transact, in the city, any business, profession, trade or occupation subject to this article without having first obtained said certificate, such offender upon conviction by the municipal judge shall be subject to a civil fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) which may be enforced by the contempt power of the municipal court and such offender will also be subject to penalties and administrative fees imposed herein on delinquent tax returns and payments. In the case of practitioners of professions and occupations, if any person, firm, or corporation whose duty it is to pay the occupation tax shall fail to pay such tax in a timely fashion, such offender, upon conviction by a municipal judge, may be subject to a civil fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), which may be collected in the same manner as delinquent taxes pursuant to section 11-24. Such person may also be subject to the penalties imposed on delinquent tax payments found in subsection (a) of this Code section and O.C.G.A. § 48-13-21. All penalties listed in this subsection shall only be invoked by delinquency of tax payment rather than by continuation of operations after failure to pay tax is due.

Sec. 11-11. - Allocation of gross receipts of business with multiple intra- or interstate locations. 
(a)  Where a business or profession is operated at more than one (1) location or where the business includes more than one (1) line, said business or profession shall be required to obtain the necessary occupation tax certificate for each location and line and pay an occupation tax in accordance with the prevailing taxing method and tax rate for each location and line.

Except for practitioners of professions and occupations, no business shall conduct any line of business without first having that line of business registered with the occupation tax clerk.

Where the dollar amount of gross receipts attributed locally cannot be determined in those businesses with multiple locations, the total gross receipts will be divided by the total number of locations in the city and elsewhere and allotted to those locations. At the time of annual registration, the business or practitioner with a location or office situated in more than one (1) jurisdiction may be required to provide the city the following: 
(1)  Financial information necessary to allocate the gross receipts of the business or practitioner among the jurisdictions in which the business or practitioner has a location or office; and 
(2)  Information relating to the allocation of the business's or practitioners' gross receipts by other local governments.

(8)  While it is the intent of the city to honor each permit, the issuance of such permit shall not grant the producer a constitutionally protected property interest.

The consultation must occur no later than three (3) business days after submittal of the application to the department. 
(7)  Prior to denying an application, if the director determines that the requested filming includes one (1) or more of the conditions described in subsections 11-436(6)a., b., c., or d. above, the director or his/her designee shall employ reasonable efforts to identify alternative filming locations, times and/or dates that eliminate the unacceptable condition(s) and that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city.

(8)  Prior to denying an application, if the director determines that the requested filming or related activity creates a violation as described in subsection 11-436(6)c. above, the director shall allow the applicant to revise the application so that the filming activities comply with applicable law. The applicant shall submit the requested modifications within two (2) business days after the request to do so. 
(9)  Prior to denying an application pursuant to subsections 11-436(6)f. or g. above, the director shall notify the applicant and producer of the potential denial and allow her/him to remedy the conditions described in those subsections within two (2) business days.

Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the director from also notifying the applicant orally. 
(12)  If the director denies an application, the applicant shall have the right to appeal the decision to the city manager or her/his designee, provided that a written request for such appeal is made to the city manager within three (3) business days after the applicant's receipt of the director's determination. The appeal shall be heard or considered within five (5) business days after the city manager receives the applicant's request, and the city manager shall evaluate the application and the director's decision in accordance with the criteria of this article XXVI. 
(13)  The city manager or his/her designee may issue her/his decision verbally, and shall issue a written decision within three (3) business days after the hearing. The written decision shall be the final decision of the city regarding the application. The applicant or producer may appeal the decision by writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Fulton County pursuant to the procedures set forth by Georgia law. Any applicant seeking a permit must bear in mind the potential for initial denial of his or her application and the subsequent time-frame needed for an appeal to be conducted. An applicant should submit his or her application to allow enough time before the proposed initial filming date for any appeal that may be required to be conducted, as the city shall not be responsible for any delay caused to the proposed filming schedule by denial and appeal of the initial application.

(Ord. No. 2017-17, § 1, 11-20-17) 
Sec. 11-437. - Modification, suspension or cancellation of a permit. 
(1)  After receiving a permit, the producer may request a material modification of the permit at any time by submitting to the department a change request and change fee as set forth in Code section 11-440. The department's ability to process the change request shall be determined pursuant to the provisions established for processing applications, as set forth in subsections 11-432(2) and (3) above. The director's decision of whether to grant or deny the modification request shall be determined as set forth in subsections 11-436(4) through 11-436(14). Submission of a change request will not impact the validity of the permit already issued, except upon written request of the producer. 
(2)  Where a producer has obtained a permit and abides by the material requirements thereof, the permit shall prevent the city's stoppage of activities that are authorized by the permit, except as otherwise set forth in subsection 11-437(3) below or as a result of applicable law. 
(3)  In the event that the College Park Police Department, College Park Fire and Rescue, and/or other member of the filming committee identifies a substantial public health or safety risk arising from or caused by the filming, and the producer is in material compliance with the permit, the following shall occur: 
(a)  Where the substantial risk is identified prior to the commencement of the filming, the director and the applicable filming committee member shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the filming committee. 
(b)  Where the substantial risk is not imminent and is identified after the commencement of the filming, the director and the applicable filming committee member shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the filming committee. 
(c)  Where the substantial risk is imminent as reasonably determined by a filming committee member and is identified after the commencement of filming, the applicable filming committee member may place a stop work order on the filming if it finds that the order will likely alleviate the substantial risk. The stop work order may be issued without advance notice where the filming committee member deems that a delay of the order will jeopardize public health and safety, and shall be lifted as quickly as possible after the risk is eliminated. The filming committee shall notify the director of the stop work order within two hours of its issuance. The director and filming committee shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, that will minimize the length and impact of the stop work order as decided by the producer, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s) as determined by the filming committee. 
(d)  Changes made to the permit pursuant to this subsection 11-437(3) shall not require payment of a change fee. 
(4)  Where the director, or a filming committee member in consultation with the director, determines that the producer is violating material term(s) of the permit, the director shall decide the appropriate remedial actions after consulting with the filming committee and the producer. If the director and/or filming committee find that a substantial public health or safety risk is arising from or caused by the material violation, the filming committee in consultation with the director may place an immediate stop work order on the filming without prior notice to the producer, and consultation with the producer shall occur after the work stoppage. The consultation between the director, filming committee member and producer shall evaluate the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional, whether permit modifications should be made, whether the stop work order should be lifted (where applicable), and what other actions should be taken (if any). Where the violation creates a substantial public health and/or safety risk, the remedial actions decided by the director will not be deemed final until the filming committee reviews the remedial actions and confirms that they will eliminate the health and safety risks. 
(Ord. No. 2017-17, § 1, 11-20-17) 
Sec. 11-438. - Responsibilities of a producer once a permit is obtained. 
(1)  A producer or producer's designee must have the permit on site at the time and location of the filming, and must also have on site any other permits required for that location by the department or any other governmental agency. 
(2)  A producer must confine filming to the locations, times, guidelines and conditions specified in the permit and must abide by all other material terms of the permit. 
(3)  Permits are not transferable.

Additionally, producer must clean and repair the filming location, and restore it to the condition it was in immediately prior to the filming, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the director and the producer. The department will inspect the filming location after the filming is completed to ascertain whether this requirement has been met. Where a producer fails to fulfill this requirement, the producer shall forfeit his or her sanitation bond as discussed in subsection 11-440(4). If the cost for the cleaning, repair and/or restoration of the filming location exceeds the amount of the sanitation bond, the director shall bill the producer for these costs and the producer must pay the invoice in full within thirty (30) days of receipt. 
(5)  The producer shall notify the department within three (3) hours or sooner of learning of any emergency event regarding or arising from the filming that involves the media, the police or fire departments or emergency medical services. 
(6)  A producer is responsible for: (a) knowing and complying with all city ordinances and other laws applicable to the filming and to the other activities arising from the producer's permit; and (b) requiring and using commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the requirement that any person working for or at the direction of the producer (including without limitation contractors) complies with all city ordinances and other laws applicable to the filming and to the other activities arising from the permit. Applicable city ordinances include, without limitation, the College Park Noise Ordinance, set forth in chapter 8, article II of the College Park Code of Ordinances. 
(7)  The requirements of subsection (6) above shall include, without limitation, that the producer is responsible for obtaining any and all permissions, licenses or other required authorizations for use of intellectual property, including intellectual property which is on public property but is not owned by the city. 
(8)  A producer is prohibited from acting as a representative or agent of the city, and from indicating city endorsement of the filming, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the director. 
(9)  Any use of the city logo must be approved by the director. 
(10)  Written notification of filming shall be sent by the producer to residents and businesses within a three-block radius of a location for which a filming permit has been issued. The notification must state that a filming permit has been issued, and must include the date(s), time(s), location(s) and activities that are authorized by the permit. Additionally, notification shall be given to the councilmember representing the district in which the filming will occur. The department shall determine the most effective means and timing of notification based upon factors such as the type of impact that the filming will have on the neighborhood, the time between receipt of the application and commencement of the filming, the producer's budget and previous communications from a neighborhood regarding notification preferences. 
(Ord. No. 2017-17, § 1, 11-20-17) 
Sec. 11-439. - Other permit requirements. 
    After a permit has been approved by the director, it will be issued once the following have occurred: 
(1)  The producer signs an indemnification provision on the permit, whereby the producer agrees to indemnify the city and its officials and employees from all claims, losses and expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs, that may arise from the permit and any of the activities performed pursuant to the permit by, on behalf of, or at the direction of the producer, except to the extent that claims, losses and/or expenses are caused by the negligence or intentional misconduct of the city, its officials and/or employees; 
(2)  The producer signs a provision agreeing to comply with all applicable environmental laws, including an agreement not to allow legally-prohibited contaminants from entering the sewage and stormwater drainage systems serving the area where the filming will occur.

(3)  The producer obtains insurance coverage in an amount determined by the city's risk manager, covers the city as an additional insured on the policy, and provides proof of the coverage in a manner established by the city's risk manager. In no event shall the risk manager base any decisions regarding the filming on the criteria set forth in subsection 11-436(14) above; and 
(4)  The producer pays the permit fee and any other applicable fees set forth in section 11-440 below. 
(Ord. No. 2017-17, § 1, 11-20-17) 
Sec. 11-440. - Fee schedule. 
    The mayor and council shall set all applicable fees arising pursuant to this article by resolution, and the department shall collect all applicable fees. These fees shall be set forth in the filming application available from the department and in other applicable sections of the code pertaining to the cost of services or goods provided by other city departments as applicable. Where the department receives funds that are attributable to services performed by another city department, such funds shall be paid to the department providing those services where prescribed by the Code. 
    Such fees are as follows: 
(1)  Nonrefundable application fee. An application for filming on either public property or private property must be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee. An application shall not be deemed complete until the application fee is received by the department. 
(2)  Filming permit fee. The filming permit fee is required for a particular filming project during a calendar month, regardless of the number of filming locations. A filming permit is valid through the last day of the calendar month and may be renewed for additional calendar months. 
a.  Standard permit fee. The standard permit fees apply when the completed application is submitted to the department more than ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the permit. 
b.  Rush permit fee. If a completed application is submitted to the department ten (10) or fewer business days prior to the effective date of the permit, the applicant must pay the standard permit fee plus a rush permit fee. Additionally, if an applicant submits an application more than ten (10) business days prior to the desired effective date of the permit, the applicant may voluntarily pay the standard permit fee plus the rush permit fee in order to have the application processed within ten (10) or fewer business days. 
c.  Material changes to filming permit. 
(i)  There is no charge for modifying a filming permit where the director reasonably determines that the modification is not material. For purposes of this article XXVI, "material" means that processing the requested change will require an expenditure of city staff time or services that is more than de minimus. 
(ii)  There is no charge for a material change to a filming permit where a completed change request is submitted to the department more than five (5) business days prior to the effective date of the permit. Where a material change is requested after the permit has taken effect, there will be no charge if the completed change request is submitted to the department more than five (5) business days prior to the implementation of the requested change. 
(iii)  If a change request for a material change is submitted to the department five (5) or fewer business days prior to the effective date of the permit or the implementation date of the change, as described in subsection 11-440(2)c.(ii) above, the applicant must pay a change fee. Additionally, if an applicant submits a change request more than five (5) business days prior to the implementation of the requested change, the applicant may voluntarily pay the change fee in order to have the change request processed within five (5) or fewer business days. 
d.  Cancellation fee. 
(i)  Except as set forth in subsections 11-440(2)d.(ii) and (2)d.(iii) below, a filming permit fee is nonrefundable. 
(ii)  If the applicant submits a change request to the department and the change results in cancellation of a filming permit for a particular calendar month, the applicant may utilize the filming permit fee for the cancelled month to purchase a new filming permit for the same project for a different calendar month. Regardless of whether a new filming permit fee is owed, the department shall determine whether a change fee is applicable based upon the timing of the change request and the standards set forth in subsection 11-440(2)c. above. 
(iii)  A filming permit fee is refundable if cancellation is required because of extraordinary circumstances for which the producer is not responsible and which are not within the producer's control. Inclement weather, except for declared states of emergency, and common illness shall not be deemed extraordinary circumstances. 
(3)  On-site services fees. On-site services fees shall be as described in subsections (a) and (b) below: 
a.  Standard on-site services fee. When submitting an application to the department seeking authorization to film at the site more than ten (10) business days (or in the event of a change request, more than five (5) business days) prior to the day of filming, the applicant may select the specific on-site services s/he needs to conduct the filming from the list of services provided in the application on an individual basis. The on-site services listed and made available to the applicant on the application each carry an individual charge as provided on the application. If the applicant requires additional on-site services not included on the application, the director or his/her designee shall coordinate with the department and film committee to (i) determine whether such services are available and (ii) to identify a cost for such services. The cost of such special on-site services, if any, shall be made known to the applicant and shall be added to the cost of on-site services if the applicant chooses to avail him or herself of the special services. 
b.  Rush on-site services fee. When submitting an application to the department seeking authorization to film at the site less than ten (10) business days (or in the event of a change request, five (5) or fewer business days) prior to the day of filming, the applicant must pay the standard on-site services fees discussed in subsection a. above plus a rush on-site services fee. There is no daily maximum regarding this rush fee. 
c.  Cancellation fee. 
(i)  Except as set forth in subsections 11-440(3)c.(ii) and (3)c.(iii) below, on-site services fees are nonrefundable. 
(ii)  If the applicant submits a change request to the department that results in cancellation of requested on-site services for a particular day, the applicant may utilize the on-site services fees for the cancelled day to pay for on-site services for the same project for a day that is within three (3) calendar days of the cancelled day. If the change request is submitted five (5) or fewer business days prior to the filming day requested in the original application or the filming day requested in the change request, whichever is earlier, a rush on-site service fee shall be owed. 
(iii)  On-site services fees are refundable if cancellation is required because of extraordinary circumstances for which the producer is not responsible and which are not within the producer's control. Inclement weather, except for declared states of emergency, and common illness shall not be deemed extraordinary circumstances. 
(4)  Sanitation bond. A sanitation bond is assessed for each public property location where filming occurs, as authorized by the filming permit. Where a producer films at more than three locations in a day for the same filming project, s/he shall be charged sanitation bond only for the first three (3) locations. The sanitation bond shall be refundable upon the conclusion of the filming and upon review of the public property location(s) by the department followed by a determination that all garbage, refuse, recyclable materials, discarded materials, and other waste produced in association with the filming project has been removed from the location(s) and properly discarded. 
(5)  Sanitation services fees. In addition to the sanitation bond required pursuant to subsection 11-440(4) above, sanitation services shall be contracted through the department of public works unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the director and producer. Applicant may select the specific sanitation services s/he needs to conduct the filming from the list of services provided in the application on an individual basis. The services listed and made available to the applicant on the application each carry an individual charge as provided on the application. 
(6)  Traffic control plans. 
a.  Entertainment industry work performed at certain locations will require a traffic control plan. The department is authorized, but not required, to coordinate the preparation of traffic control plans associated with entertainment industry work with the College Park Police Department. The cost of having the department prepare a traffic control plan is included within the permit fee and any on-site services fees. 
b.  The department's preparation of a traffic control plan will include submitting the plan to the College Park Police Department for review and to the office of transportation for approval, and editing the plan as needed to meet the requirements of the two reviewing departments, all at no additional charge to the producer. 
c.  The producer is not required to have the department prepare the traffic control plan, and there will be no penalty against or differential treatment of any producer who has the plan created by a person or entity other than the department. However, any traffic control plan the producer has had created by an entity other than the department must be submitted to the department for timely review in accordance with subsection 11-436(3) above. 
(7)  Street closures permits-Minimum notice. Any and all street closures must be approved by the College Park Police Department. The director may help coordinate the acquisition of a street closure permit for city streets from the College Park Police Department. For closure of a state road and/or highway located within or crossing through the city, the applicant must also complete any application required by the Georgia Department of Transportation for said closures and must receive a permit for said closure(s) from the Georgia Department of Transportation before said closure(s) will be approved by the College Park Police Department. A full street closure, whether for city or state roads, will not be permitted unless the application or change request is submitted at least fifteen (15) business days prior to the closure. Rush fees may not be utilized for full street closure requests. Street closures may be incorporated into any traffic control plan developed in accordance with subsection (6) above provided said street closures and the subsequent traffic control plan are approved by the College Park Police Department.

ARTICLE IV. - CURFEW FOR MINORS 

Sec. 12-60. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the Curfew for Minors Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97) 
Sec. 12-61. - Findings; purpose. 
    The mayor and council after having received and studied reports compiled by the police department are alarmed and concerned for the safety and well-being of juveniles within the city, as well as the high number of incidents of thefts, including, but not limited to burglary and motor vehicle thefts being perpetrated by juveniles within the city. With the interstate highways, rapid transit system, and Hartsfield International Airport bringing thousands of nonresident transient people into and through the city at all hours of the day and night, juveniles are found to be at a high risk. The national epidemic of drugs and crimes of violence are of such nature that all reasonable and constitutional efforts must be employed to insulate and protect our youthful citizens from the influence and dangers associated with such activities. It is the intent of this article to make the parents the primary agents of enforcement, and, in addition to promote family life by encouraging children to be at home. 
    Prevailing community standards of family responsibility, public good, safety and welfare have determined that there is a proper time for cessation of outdoor activities by minors. This standard takes into consideration the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for exposure of minors to potential risks incident to immaturity, along with exceptions and provisions so as to not prohibit or unnecessary infringe upon reasonable legitimate purposes of any person. 
    Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm. Legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effect and, as parental control increases, the likelihood of juvenile delinquency and danger to minors decreases. The cooperative enforcement of this curfew by the city, the parents, and the minor will provide for a more safe and healthy community environment and will achieve the purposes hereinbefore stated. 
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97) 
Sec. 12-62. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article: 
(1)  City is the City of College Park, Fulton and Clayton Counties, Georgia. 
(2)  Minor is any person under the age of seventeen (17), or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person sixteen (16) or less years of age. 
(3)  Parent is any person having legal custody of a minor (i) as a natural or adoptive parent, (ii) as a legal guardian, (iii) as a person who stands in loco parentis or (iv) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court. 
(4)  Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, alone or with others, in such manner that any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in section 12-64 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence type curfew ordinance. More and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended for use of the meaningful phrase "be or remain." 
(5)  Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel, or in the case of a sidewalk, for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right of way of a street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what is called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise. 
(6)  Time of night referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the City of College Park, prima facie the time then observed in the College Park Administrative Office. 
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97) 
Sec. 12-63. - Curfew for minors. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person sixteen (16) or less years of age (under seventeen (17)) to be or remain in or upon the streets within the City of College Park at night during the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning: 
(1)  At 8:00 p.m. for minors thirteen (13) or less years of age; 
(2)  At 10:00 p.m. for minors fourteen (14), fifteen (15) or sixteen (16) years of age. 
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97; Ord. No. 2008-15, § 1, 11-3-08) 
Sec. 12-64. - Exception. 
(a)  In the following exceptional cases a minor on a College Park street during the nocturnal hours for which section 12-63 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation (and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and their fellow citizens) shall not, however, be considered in violation of the curfew ordinance. 
(1)  When accompanied by a parent of such minor. 
(2)  When accompanied by an adult authorized and approved by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)  When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly, provided that the exercise of such right is clearly evidenced by the minor's conduct. 
(4)  When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor who has not communicated an object to the police officer. 
(5)  When returning home, by a direct route from (and with thirty (30) minutes of the termination of) a school activity of a religious or other parentally-approved association. 
(6)  When authorized, by action by the mayor and council or chief of police or his or her assistant, in cases or reasonable necessity. Normally such action by the mayor and council or chief of police permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicly through news media and through other agencies such as the schools and churches, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more than thirty (30) minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity, and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this curfew ordinance. 
(7)  When traveling from or to the minor's residence and a verifiable place of employment and within thirty (30) minutes of the minor's time of departure or arrival. 
(8)  When in a motor vehicle with parental consent and engaged in bona fide interstate movement through the city, particularly on normal routes such as U.S. Highway 29 and interstate highways I-85 and I-285. This also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in the city. 
(b)  Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, are severable, as hereinafter provided, but here reemphasized; and additional, also severable, other exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary, middle and high schools, will be considered by the mayor and council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward, precinct and neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency. 
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97) 
Sec. 12-65. - Parental responsibility. 
    It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow, such minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, the curfew ordinance. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. 
(Ord. No. 97-10, § 1, 4-21-97) 
Sec. 12-66. - Police procedures. 
(a)  A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the curfew ordinance, normally shall take the minor into custody. A parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor, and upon arrival the parent shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgement in determining age. 
(b)  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or is known. 
(c)  In any event such police officer shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, file a written report with the department. 
(d)  When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent. 
(e)  In the case of a first violation by a minor, the city, at its discretion, may issue: (1) a warning citation to the minor's parent so as to apprise the parent that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance, including enforcement of the parental responsibility provisions in section 12-65 and the penalties in section 12-67; or (2) an actual citation to the minor's parent fully enforcing the curfew ordinance, including enforcement of the parental responsibility provisions in section 12-65 and the penalties in section 12-67.

Sec. 12-67. - Penalties. 
    Prevailing community standards, as to when minors should be off the streets as reflected in this curfew ordinance, are the basis for the following legal sanctions. 
(1)  For the first violation by a parent of section 12-65, the parent shall be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) and, for each subsequent violation of 12-65 by that parent, the fine shall be increased by an additional one hundred dollars ($100.00), i.e., two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the second offense, three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the third offense. For purposes of this section, a warning citation given to a parent pursuant to section 12-66(e)(1) shall not constitute the first violation by that parent. The city judge, upon finding a parent guilty, or upon acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, shall sentence the parent to pay such fine and the costs of prosecution, and upon refusal to pay such fine and costs, the parent may be imprisoned for a period not exceeding ten (10) days. 
(2)  Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of the curfew ordinance more than two (2) times shall be reported to the juvenile court in the county of his residence with an appropriate petition filed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 15-11-1 et seq.

ARTICLE V. - TRUANCY 

Sec. 12-80. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the Truancy Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97) 
Sec. 12-81. - Findings; purpose. 
    The mayor and council after having received and studied reports compiled by the police department are alarmed and concerned for the safety and well-being of juveniles within the city, as well as with the high number of incidents of thefts, including but not limited to burglary and motor vehicle thefts being perpetrated by juveniles within the city. With the interstate highways, rapid transit system, and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport bringing thousands of nonresident transient people into and through the city at all hours of the day and night, juveniles are found to be at a high risk. The national epidemic of drugs and crimes of violence are of such nature that all reasonable and constitutional efforts must be employed to insulate and protect our youthful citizens from the influence and dangers associated with such activities. It is the intent of this article to make the parents the primary agents of enforcement, and, in addition, to enforce the mandatory education requirements in the State of Georgia. 
    The Official Code of Georgia Annotated provides that any child between the ages of six (6) and sixteen (16) shall be enrolled in and attend a public school, private school, or a home study program. While this requirement supports the state's goal of providing an education to its residents, information has been provided to the mayor and council which indicates an extremely high truancy rate in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The goal of this article, therefore, is to support compulsory education and to reduce the truancy rate within the city. 
    Parental responsibility for enrolling children in school is required. Legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effect and, as parental control increases, the likelihood of school absences, juvenile delinquency, and danger to minors decreases. The cooperative enforcement of this article by the city, the parents, and the minor will support the Mandatory Attendance Law, will provide for a more safe and healthy community environment, and will achieve the purposes hereinbefore stated. 
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97; Ord. No. 2016-16, § 1, 5-2-16) 
Sec. 12-82. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article: 
(1)  City is the City of College Park, Fulton and Clayton Counties, Georgia. 
(2)  Minor is any person between their sixth and sixteenth birthdays, or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, between the ages of six (6) and sixteen (16) years of age. 
(3)  Parent is any person having legal custody of a minor (i) as a natural or adoptive parent, (ii) as a legal guardian, (iii) as a person who stands in loco parentis or (iv) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court. 
(4)  Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, alone or with others, in such manner that any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in section 12-84 so that is not a mere prohibitory or presence type truancy ordinance. More and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of meaningful phrase "be or remain." 
(5)  School day is any day which the Clayton County or Fulton County Boards of Education have scheduled as a day when schools will be open and student attendance is required. 
(6)  Street is a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what is called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, or road or otherwise. 
(7)  Time of day referred to herein as based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the City of College Park, prima facie the time then observed in the College Park Administrative Office. 
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97; Ord. No. 2016-16, § 2, 5-2-16) 
Sec. 12-83. - Truancy. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person between the ages of six (6) and sixteen (16) years of age to be or remain in or upon the streets within the City of College Park during the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on any school day. 
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97; Ord. No. 2016-16, § 3, 5-2-16) 
Sec. 12-84. - Exceptions. 
(a)  In the following exceptional cases a minor on a College Park street during school hours for which section 12-83 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation (and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and their fellow-citizens) shall not, however, be considered in violation of the truancy ordinance: 
(1)  When the minor has a valid excuse from school attendance and is: 
a.  Accompanied by a parent of such minor; 
b.  Accompanied by an adult authorized and approved by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area; 
c.  On the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides; 
d.  Participating in an approved school or study activity which requires the minor to be off of school property, or returning to school or home, by a direct route from (and with thirty (30) minutes of the termination of) such activity;

f.  When the minor is enrolled in a valid home study program as authorized by O.C.G.A. § 20-2-690; 
(2)  When in a motor vehicle with parental consent and engaged bona fide interstate movement through the city, particularly on normal routes such as U.S. Highway 29 and interstate highways I-85 and I-285. This also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in the city; 
(3)  When the minor has completed all course study requirements for high school graduation; 
(4)  When the minor is married in accordance with applicable law; 
(5)  When a parent has failed to enroll the minor in a public school, private school, or home study program; provided, however, that in such instance, the parent shall be issued a citation for violation of O.C.G.A. § 20-2-690.1. 
(b)  Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, are severable, as hereinafter provided, but here reemphasized; and additional, also severable, other exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary, middle and high schools, will be considered by the mayor and council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward, precinct and neighborhood spokesman, parents, officers and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency. 
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97) 
Sec. 12-85. - Parental responsibility. 
    It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow, such minor to be or remain upon any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, the truancy ordinance. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. 
(Ord. No. 97-05, § 1, 3-3-97) 
Sec. 12-86. - Police procedures. 
(a)  A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the truancy ordinance, normally shall take the minor into temporary custody and deliver the child to the school from which the child is absent, or to the juvenile authorities. A parent shall immediately be notified to come to the school or to the juvenile authorities, and upon arrival, the minor's parent shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age. 
(b)  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a minor of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or is known. 
(c)  In any event such police officer shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, file a written report with the department. 
(d)  When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the school from which the minor is absent, or to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent. 
(e)  In the case of a first violation by a minor, the city, at its discretion, may issue: (1) a warning citation to the minor's parent so as to apprise the parent that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the truancy ordinance, including enforcement of the parental responsibility provisions in section 12-85 and the penalties in section 12-87; or (2) an actual citation to the minor's parent fully enforcing the truancy ordinance, including enforcement of the parental responsibility provisions in section 12-85 and the penalties in section 12-87. Where the parent has failed to enroll the minor in a public school, a private school, or a home study program that meets the requirements for a public school, a private school, or a home study program in violation of O.C.G.A. § 20-2-690.1, the parent shall be issued a citation under that statute instead of this ordinance.

Sec. 12-87. - Penalties. 
    Prevailing community standards, as to when minors should be off the streets and in school as reflected in this truancy ordinance, are the basis for the following legal sanctions. 
(1)  For the first violation by a parent of section 12-85, the parent shall be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) and, for each subsequent violation of 12-85 by that parent, the fine shall be increased by an additional one hundred dollars ($100.00), i.e., two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the second offense, three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the third offense. For purposes of this section, a warning citation given to a parent pursuant to section 12-86(e)(1) shall not constitute the first violation by that parent. The city judge, upon finding a parent guilty, or upon acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, shall sentence the parent to pay such fine and the costs of prosecution, and upon refusal to pay such fine and costs, the parent may be imprisoned for a period not exceeding ten (10) days. 
(2)  Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of the truancy ordinance more than two (2) times shall be reported to the juvenile court in the county of his residence with an appropriate petition filed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 15-11-1 et seq.

If a minor child receives a pension hereunder and the right to continue to receive same terminates because of the death or marriage or attainment of majority by all minor children, upon certification of such facts to the pension board, a pension shall be continued without a new application to the surviving spouse qualified to receive benefits hereunder for the period of time that such spouse remains unmarried.

Any employee who has been in the active service and on the payroll of the city for twenty-five (25) years or more, of which service five (5) years or more has immediately preceded the right to have benefits under the provisions of this pension plan, and whose health during said period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity, shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and to receive from the pension fund a disability pension equal in amount to the normal service pension to which such employee would otherwise be entitled. This disability pension shall be allowed without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto.

In the absence of any other disability pension from the city, a service-related disability pension in an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent of the accrued benefit, having a minimum monthly payment of no less than two hundred dollars ($200.00), shall be paid to a disabled employee, without regard to age or length of service, who shall become totally and permanently disabled as the direct and proximate result of any of the following causes:

(2)  An occupational or industrial disease due to specific poisons, mechanical or chemical irritants and the like, which are recognized as a peculiar hazard of the occupation in the service of the city in which such person was engaged and of a character which other persons not so engaged do not contract; or 
(3)  A disease or illness resulting immediately and exclusively from emergency exposure in the line of duty as an officer or employee of the city without the intervention of natural causes. 
(c)  Nonservice-related disability. An employee who is not otherwise eligible for a disability pension, but who has been in the active service and on the payroll of the city for the immediately preceding ten (10) years and whose health during such period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity, shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and to receive from the pension fund, for the period that such employee's health continues to be totally and permanently impaired, a disability pension in an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent of the accrued benefits. This disability pension shall be provided without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto. In no event shall the monthly benefit payment be less than two hundred dollars ($200.00). 
(d)  Double collection. Under no circumstances shall any employee be allowed to collect a disability pension while also collecting a normal service pension from the city. 
(e)  Continuance of disability prerequisite to payments: 
(1)  Investigation. Any disability pension except that resulting from the provisions of subsection (a), shall be paid only during the continuance of such employee's total disability. If the status of an employee's total disability comes into question, the pension board shall be authorized from time to time, but no more frequently than once every six (6) months, to investigate and inquire into the physical condition of the employee. If deemed necessary by the pension board, the employee shall be examined by a physician selected by the pension board for determination of the employee's disability status. An issue regarding continuance of disability and eligibility of the employee to receive a pension may be framed at the request of any member of the pension board or by any member of the governing body. Thereupon, the pension board shall proceed, after twenty (20) days' notice to the employee, to fully investigate and inquire into the question of continuance of disability. 
(2)  Testimony, etc. The city and the employee shall have the right to present sworn and documentary testimony upon the question of the continuance of total disability and both parties shall have the means of compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses and the right to be represented by counsel. In the event that the judgment of the pension board should be that total disability has ceased, judgment shall be entered accordingly and the pension theretofore allowed shall immediately cease and no longer be payable to the employee. Said judgment shall be entered upon the minutes of the board and shall constitute a final judgment, which either the governing body or the employee may appeal by writ of certiorari as now provided by law. 
(3)  Authority of the pension board. The authority of the pension board to enter a new judgment terminating a disability pension formerly allowed to a disabled employee must be exercised during the employee's lifetime. If such authority is not exercised during the employee's lifetime, the question of continuance of the employee's disability pension may never be raised. 
(f)  Reports of injury in line of duty. Every employee shall be required, within thirty (30) days after an injury in the line of duty as an officer or employee of the city, to file with the clerk of the pension board, upon forms provided for such purpose, a written report of such injury, indicating the cause and extent of injury to the best of the employee's knowledge and belief. Said written report shall include all other pertinent information requested by the pension board or by the clerk. Notice of injury properly given to the city pursuant to the workers' compensation laws of the state shall meet the notice requirements of this subsection. The minutes of the pension board shall from month to month show the date of filing of each such report, the names of the persons filing such reports and a brief statement of the nature and cause of injury claimed. Written reports shall be preserved by the clerk as part of the permanent records of the pension board. Any employee so injured and failing without excuse to file such report shall be forever barred from basing a claim for a disability pension on the injury so received. 
(g)  Medical and laboratory examination; reports.

Sec. 14-68. - Classes and amounts of pensions. 
(a)  The term "employees" wherever used in this division shall refer only to full-time officers and employees who have been on the payroll of the city for more than six (6) months. "Probationary employees" as herein defined are excluded from all benefits in said pension system during the first six (6) months of their employment. 
(b)  As used in this division the words, "average monthly salary or wage," shall mean an amount equivalent to the average monthly salary or wages paid during the last twenty-four (24) months that such employees received a salary or wages as an officer or employee of the city. To illustrate, if a person upon whose service a pension depends drew, during the last twelve (12) months that such employee received wages as an employee of the city, the sum of one hundred seventy dollars ($170.00) per month and during the preceding twelve (12) months the sum of one hundred forty dollars ($140.00) per month, the "average monthly salary or wage" of such employee would be the sum of one hundred fifty-five dollars ($155.00) per month. If the same employee during the last nine (9) months of employment by the city drew the sum of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) per month and during the preceding fifteen (15) months the sum of one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00) per month, the average monthly salary or wage of such employee as used in this division would be the sum of one hundred ninety-six dollars and eighty-seven and one-half cents ($196.871/2) per month. 
(Code 1963, § 2-69) 
Sec. 14-69. - Service pension. 
    Any such employee who has attained the age of sixty-five (65) with ten (10) years of service, or who has attained the age of fifty-five (55) and completed twenty-five (25) years of service on the payroll of the city, of which five (5) years or more must have been immediately preceding the right to have benefits under this division, shall be entitled to retire as a matter of right and to receive a service pension in an amount equal to one-half (1/2) the average monthly salary or wage as herein defined, paid to such employee, but not exceeding the sum of one thousand three hundred dollars ($1,300.00) per annum in any instance, which service pension shall be paid monthly during the remainder of the natural life of such employee, except that such pension shall cease immediately upon acceptance of such employee of other public employment of the nature defined by section 14-71. Pension benefits for an employee who has not attained the age of fifty-five (55) and completed twenty-five (25) years of service shall be computed on the same basis as provided for a partial pension for disability. 
(Code 1963, § 2-70) 
Sec. 14-70. - Service connected disability pensions. 
    A service connected disability pension in an amount equal to one-half (1/2) the average monthly salary or wage as herein defined, but not exceeding thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300.00) per annum in any instance, shall be paid to a disabled employee without regard to age or length of service, who shall become totally and permanently disabled as the direct and proximate result of any of the following causes: 
(1)  Accident suffered in line of duty as an officer or employee of the city resulting immediately in total and permanent disability of such person; 
(2)  An occupational or industrial disease due to specific poisons, mechanical or chemical irritants and the like, which are recognized as a peculiar hazard of the occupation in the service of the city in which such person was engaged and of a character which other persons not so engaged do not contract; or 
(3)  From a disease or illness resulting immediately and exclusively from emergency exposure in the line of duty as an officer or employee of the city, without the intervention of natural causes. 
(Code 1963, § 2-71) 
Sec. 14-71. - Pension for disability. 
(a)  Full pension. Any employee of the city who has been in the active service and on the payroll of the city for twenty-five (25) years or more, of which service five (5) years or more must have been immediately preceding the right to have benefits under this division and whose health during said period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity, shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and to receive from the pension fund hereby created a disability pension equal in amount to the normal retirement pension to which such employee would otherwise be entitled. The disability pension provided by this section shall be allowed without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto. 
(b)  Partial pension. Any employee of the city who is not entitled to a pension as described in subsection (a), but who has been in the active service and on the payroll of the city for ten (10) years or more of which service five (5) years or more must have been immediately preceding the right to have benefits under this division and whose health during said period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and to receive from the pension fund hereby created for the period that such employee's health continues to be totally and permanently impaired, a disability pension in an amount proportionate to the total number of whole years of service to the city by such employees. The disability pension provided by this section shall be allowed without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto. The amount of such disability pension shall be such proportionate part of the service pension allowed after twenty-five (25) years of service for an employee earning the same salary or wages that the number of whole years of service by such disabled employee bears to twenty-five (25) years. To illustrate, the amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00) after fifteen (15) years of service to the city would be fifteen-twenty-fifths of one-half of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00), or the sum of fifty-two dollars and fifty cents ($52.50) per month. The amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) would after nineteen and one-half (191/2) years of service be nineteen-twenty-fifths of one-half of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) per month or the sum of eighty-five dollars and fifty cents ($85.50) per month. The amount of pension allowed for disability under this subsection shall never exceed the sum of thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300) per annum with respect to employees in the employ of the city prior to July, 1, 1965, who retain their status in the pension plan of the city as said plan existed to the year 1965. 
(c)  Under no circumstances shall any employee of said city be allowed to collect a disability pension and a normal retirement pension. 
(Code 1963, § 2-72) 
Cross reference- For amendment to this section, see § 14-90(7). 
Sec. 14-72. - Increase in amount of pension. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision herein, every person now entitled to and receiving a pension hereunder and so entitled and so receiving the same on January 1, 1980, shall be entitled and so receiving an additional and extra fifty dollars ($50.00) per month. This section is to become effective January 1, 1981, and shall not apply to any person not entitled to and receiving a pension from the city as of January 1, 1980. 
(Code 1963, § 2-73) 
Sec. 14-73. - Continuance of disability prerequisite to payments. 
(a)  Investigation. Any disability pension allowed to any city employee from any cause, that is either the service connected disability pension or the disability pension allowed after ten (10) years or more of service, except the disability pension allowed after twenty-five (25) years or more of service, shall be allowed and paid only during the continuance of such employee's total disability, except that such pension may be continued to the employee's qualified widow or qualified minor children in a reduced amount if the employee makes the additional contributions provided by section 14-79. If a question should arise at any time as to the continuance of total disability and the eligibility for that reason of the pensioner to continue to receive a pension, the pension board shall be authorized from time to time, but not oftener than once each six (6) months, to investigate and inquire into the physical condition of such pensioner and if it deems advisable to have such pensioner examined by a physician selected by the pension board for that purpose. An issue regarding continuance of disability and eligibility of the pensioner to receive a pension may be framed at the request of any member of the pension board or of any member of the governing body. Thereupon, the pension board shall proceed, after twenty (20) days' notice to the pensioner, to fully investigate and inquire into the question of continuance of disability. 
(b)  Testimony. Both parties, that is, both the pensioner and the governing body shall have the right to present sworn and documentary testimony upon the question of the continuance of total disability and both parties shall have compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses and the right to be represented by counsel. In the event that the judgment of the pension board should be that total disability ceased during the pensioner's lifetime, judgment shall be entered accordingly and the pension theretofore allowed to the pensioner for total and permanent disability shall immediately cease and determine and shall no longer be payable either to the pensioner or the pensioner's beneficiary. The judgment of the pension board upon an issue of continuance of disability shall be entered upon the minutes of the board and shall constitute a final judgment which either the governing body or the pensioner may review by writ of certiorari as now provided by law. 
(c)  Authority of board. The right of the pension board to enter a new judgment terminating a disability pension formerly allowed to a disabled employee must be exercised during the employee's lifetime. If such right is not exercised during the employee's lifetime and if such employee has made all contributions required by this division for benefits to such employee's widow or minor children, the question of continuance of the employee's disability pension to such employee's qualified widow or qualified minor child, at the reduced amount provided by this division, may never again be raised.

Said written report shall include all other pertinent information requested by the board on its forms or by the clerk. The minutes of the pension board shall from month to month show the date of filing of each such report, the name of the person or persons filing same and a brief statement of the nature and cause of injury claimed. Written reports shall be preserved by the secretary as a part of the permanent records of the board. Any employee so injured and failing without excuse to file such report shall be forever barred from basing a claim for a pension on the injury so received. 
(Code 1963, § 2-75) 
Sec. 14-75. - Medical and laboratory examinations; reports. 
    All persons hereafter employed by the city, all probationary employees and all employees injured in line of duty shall stand such physical examination, including laboratory and X-ray examination, as the governing body may from time to time require. Such examinations shall be conducted by the persons designated by the governing body and written reports thereof shall be directed to the governing body, filed with the pension board and preserved as a part of the records of the board. Such reports shall be prima facie evidence in any future proceeding before the pension board of facts stated therein regarding the physical condition of such employees. The expense of examination of any person injured in the line of duty as a city employee shall be borne by the governing body. The expense of examination of other employees or prospective employees shall be borne in such manner as the governing body may from time to time require. 
(Code 1963, § 2-76) 
Sec. 14-76. - Death of employee not otherwise entitled to pension; pension right of survivors in certain cases.

(Code 1963, § 2-77) 
Sec. 14-77. - Death of employee due to injury in course of employment. 
    Any employee of the city who is making regular contributions into the pension fund of the city under this division and who dies as a result of any injury or personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of such person's employment with the city (the words "injury" and "personal injury" being defined as follows: "Injury" and "personal injury" shall mean only injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment and shall not include a disease in any form except where it results naturally and unavoidably from the accident, nor shall "injury" and "personal injury" include injury caused by the wilful act of a third person directed against an employee for reasons personal to such employee), shall be conclusively entitled to a service-connected disability pension as of the date of such employee's death, the amount of which shall be determined as service-connected disability pension is determined under section 14-60, and it is specifically provided that any widow or minor children who shall be the beneficiary or beneficiaries of any pension of such an employee shall have the right to make application for and receive said pension in the amount of seventy-five (75) per cent of the amount of the pension such an employee would be entitled to receive under this provision and such pension shall be continued to such beneficiary or beneficiaries in the regular and normal manner as is provided for continuing pensions to a widow or minor children under this law.

(Code 1963, § 2-78) 
Sec. 14-78. - Pension fund; accumulation, maintenance. 
(a)  Employee contributions. All pensions provided by the terms of this division shall be payable out of the pension fund accumulated and maintained by contributions by the employees and by the governing body in the following manner: Beginning with the first calendar month following approval of this division, there shall be deducted from the salaries and wages of all fulltime employees of the city (except probationary employees and officers elected by the people who cannot share in said fund) the sum of three (3) per cent of such salary or wages earned during each calendar month, but not exceeding the sum of six dollars ($6.00) per month for each employee, which amount so deducted shall be paid to the treasurer of the pension board and credited to the pension account of each respective employee. If such employee desires that such employee's widow or the employee's minor child or children succeed to the employee's rights as a pensioner, either upon employee's death after retirement on a pension or after the employee was eligible to retire, such employee may provide therefor by making the necessary designation of a beneficiary as herein provided and by paying within the time required by this division, in addition to the ordinary contribution of three (3) per cent of wages, an extra one per cent of such salary or wages, but not exceeding the sum of two dollars ($2.00) per month in any instance for widow's and children's benefits. If such additional deduction for benefits to widows and minor children is authorized, said extra one per cent of salary or wages shall be paid to the treasurer of the pension fund and credited to the pension account of such contributing employee. 
(b)  Employer contributions. The governing body shall, beginning with the calendar year 1946 and annually thereafter, appropriate and pay into the pension fund created by this division an amount equal to the contributions thereto by all employees of the city during each calendar year, thereby matching dollar for dollar the contributions of all employees to said pension fund. 
(c)  Fund management. Said pension fund shall be managed and invested by the pension board for the use and benefit of all employees of the city participating therein, and for the use and benefit of widows and dependent minor children of employees who have made for their protection the additional contribution of wages which is provided by this division. All investments of pension funds shall be authorized by the pension board. The board is specifically authorized to place funds held by it with banks or trust companies having corporate trust powers and authorized to do business in this state, and to authorize any such bank or trust company to invest and reinvest such funds for its account, subject to the provisions relating to investments by domestic insurance companies under the laws of the state. The board is further authorized to employ such banks and trust companies as agents for the keeping of records and the receipt and disbursement of funds held by or due the board. The board shall prescribe the powers and duties of such trustees in accordance with this division. The board is specifically authorized to place funds held by it with insurance companies authorized to do business in this state for the purpose of investment at guaranteed or anticipated rates of interest. The board is further authorized to purchase insurance contracts on the lives of participating employees and to purchase annuity contracts to provide retirement benefits to participating employees and pay all premiums thereon. The board is further authorized to employ such insurance companies to provide actuarial advice and to provide services in the keeping of records, and the receipt and disbursement of funds held by or due the board. The board is authorized to invest and reinvest funds held by it in any investments which are legal investments for domestic insurance companies under the laws of the state. 
(d)  Deficiency in fund. In case of deficiency in the pension fund at any time or inability to pay or to meet any claim lawfully allowed by the pension board and payable therefrom, the governing body shall provide for such payment out of other lawful revenue and pay to the pension board such sum of money as may be necessary to pay all lawful claims against the pension fund hereby created, and if necessary shall levy a tax to provide funds for said purpose. 
(Code 1963, § 2-79) 
Sec. 14-79. - Beneficiaries; designation; contribution required; payment of pension. 
(a)  Designation. In order to have the benefits of this section, an employee now on the payroll of the city (except a probationary employee) shall within thirty (30) days after approval of the ordinance from which this section is derived, and a person thereafter employed or a probationary employee shall within six (6) months after employment commences, file with the clerk of the pension board on forms provided for that purpose a request in writing that either the employee's spouse or minor child or children be recorded as beneficiary to receive benefits for which the employee agrees to make the additional contributions provided by this section. In addition to designation of beneficiary, such form shall state the names and ages of all members of the family of such employee. Beneficiary may be changed to the other class, that is, from spouse to children or from children to spouse, at any time. Such written requests shall be kept by the clerk as a part of the permanent records of the pension board. 
(b)  Additional contributions. Thereafter, an additional one per cent of such employee's salary or wages shall be deducted each month and paid into the pension fund created hereby, except that such additional payment shall not exceed the sum of two dollars ($2.00) per month in any instance. 
(c)  Rights of beneficiary. Except as herein provided, the last beneficiary so specified shall succeed to the rights of such employee as pensioner, upon such employee's death after retirement on pension, or being eligible to retire, except that the amount of pension paid to a beneficiary so designated shall be seventy-five (75) per cent of the amount of the pension that such employee was receiving, or entitled to receive, at the time of the employee's death. 
(d)  Eligibility of beneficiary. A widow cannot receive a pension hereunder after she remarries, or unless she had been married to the employee upon whose service the pension depends at least five (5) years before such employee retired or became eligible for retirement. A minor child cannot receive a pension hereunder if more than eighteen (18) years of age, or after marriage. If there should in any case be more than one minor child unmarried and eighteen (18) years of age or under, then any pension payable to minor children hereunder shall be payable to and divided in equal shares between all minor children who, as it appears from the record filed with the pension board, are entitled to benefits under this division. Disbursement of pensions to minor children shall be made to their legally qualified guardian. 
(e)  Nonexistence of qualified widow. If an employee specified his widow and there is no widow qualified to receive a pension under this division, but there are one or more minor children who would be qualified to receive a pension if they had been designated by the employee, such qualified minor children or their guardian may make application to the pension board and receive a pension as if designated by the employee to receive same. If a widow receives a pension hereunder and her right to continue to receive same terminates because of her death or remarriage, upon certification of the facts to the pension board such pension shall be continued without a new application to the minor child or children qualified to receive a pension under this division. 
(f)  Nonexistence of qualified minor. If an employee specifies such employee's minor child or children and there is no minor child qualified to receive a pension under this division, but there is a widow who would be qualified if she had been designated by the employee, then such qualified widow may make application to the pension board and receive a pension as if designated by the employee to receive same. If a minor child or children receive a pension hereunder and the right to continue to receive same terminates because of the death or the marriage or attainment by all minor children of more than eighteen (18) years of age, upon certification of the facts to the pension board such pension shall be continued without a new application to the surviving widow qualified to receive benefits hereunder for the period of time that she remains unmarried. 
(g)  Death of beneficiary. Upon death of either a minor child or widow, such person's estate shall be entitled to no benefits under this division. A pension payable to a widow under this division shall be payable for the term of her natural life or widowhood. 
(Code 1963, § 2-80) 
Cross reference- For amendment to this section, see § 14-90(6). 
Sec. 14-80. - Death of pensioner. 
    Upon the death of any pensioner of any of the classes set forth in this division, such pensioner's pension shall cease and determine and shall not continue to be paid to such pensioner's heirs, executors or administrators, except as herein provided. 
(Code 1963, § 2-81) 
Sec. 14-81. - Probation period of six months required. 
    Notwithstanding any provision or clause of this division, no employee of the governing body shall be required to make any contribution to the pension fund established by this division and no pension rights shall accrue to such employee or such employee's widow or minor child for a period of six (6) months after the commencement of such employee's employment as an employee of the city. In the event such new employee continues in the service of the city after the six (6) month period, then the full amount of contributions required by this division of other employees making the same salary or wages during the same six (6) months shall be deducted from the employee's wages during the seventh month of employment and, together with all contributions required by this division during the seventh and succeeding months, shall be paid into the pension fund and credited to the account of such contributing employee. The amount of such deduction during the seventh month, where three (3) per cent with maximum of six dollars ($6.00) per month or four (4) per cent with maximum of eight dollars ($8.00) per month, shall depend upon whether such probationary employee made the election for benefits for widow and minor children within the six (6)-month period as required by this division. 
    Beginning with the seventh month of employment, but not before, such new employee and such employee's beneficiaries herein named shall acquire pension rights under this division. After such pension status is acquired, the period of service of such new employee for the purpose of measuring benefits under this division shall date from the beginning of the period of original employment by the city. 
    It is the intention of this section of this division to require in all cases a six-month probation period, during which time a new employee shall not contribute to, nor acquire rights under, the pension system hereby created for the city, but that after the termination of the probationary period such new employee shall acquire pension rights which, if such employee remains in the service of the city that length of time, shall date back to such employee's first employment on probation by the governing body.

    No refund of any portion of the contribution of an employee to the pension fund shall be made under any circumstances, either to a former employee, an employee leaving the service of the city, or the executor, administrator or heirs-at-law for a former employee, except that if an employee leaves the service of the city subsequent to February 1, 1959, after at least five (5) years' continuous service and desires to surrender all pension rights under this division, the employee shall, upon application therefor within ninety (90) days after leaving the service of the city, be entitled to a refund of three-fourths (3/4) of the total contributions made by such employee, and except that if an employee is discharged by the governing body to enable a returning veteran to resume the position that such veteran formerly held with the city, then all contributions made by such displaced employee shall be refunded to such employee.

DIVISION 4. - 1965 PENSION PLAN 

Sec. 14-90. - Establishment and applicability of plan. 
    The pension benefits provided by this section and the several subsections of this section shall be in lieu of the pension benefits provided to employees under laws affording pension benefits to employees of the city in existence prior to the adoption of the enactment from which this section is derived, approved by the General Assembly during the year 1965. 
(1)  Any officer or employee of the city who was so employed on the effective date of such enactment, and who is otherwise eligible for pension benefits under the act approved January 30, 1946 (Ga. L. 1946, pp. 432 through 454) and sections 14-66 through 14-83, may elect to come under the provisions of this section, and the several subsections hereof, in lieu of other pension benefits and obligations which the applicant might have been entitled to from the city under the pension plan of the city as same existed prior to the effective date of such enactment, to the extent that the provisions of this section are in conflict with prior acts establishing or amending the pension plan for employees of the city. All officers and employees employed by the city on the effective date of this section, who do not in writing elect to accept the benefits and obligations of this section, and the several subsections hereof, shall have the rights and obligations with respect to the employees pension plan of the city determined under the law as it existed prior to this section. Employees and officers of the city who become employed by the city after the effective date of the enactment from which this section is derived shall have their benefits and obligations with respect to the pension plan of the city determined with reference to and fixed by the provisions of said pension plan as amended by this section. 
(2)  Any officer or employee of the city who elects to come under the provisions of this section, and the several subsections hereof, or who becomes employed by the city subsequent to the effective date of the enactment from which this section is derived and who retires as a matter of right and after reaching the age of fifty-five (55), shall be entitled to receive a service pension in an amount equal to two (2) per cent of the first three hundred dollars ($300.00) of such employee's average monthly salary, plus one and one-half (11/2) per cent of such employee's average monthly salary over three hundred dollars ($300.00), multiplied by the number of years of service. For example, an employee who retires as a matter of right after twenty-five (25) years of service, whose monthly salary is five hundred dollars ($500.00), is entitled to a monthly pension in the amount of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) determined as follows: Two (2) per cent of the first three hundred dollars ($300.00) of average monthly salary equals six dollars ($6.00). One and one-half (11/2) per cent of the average monthly salary over three hundred dollars ($300.00), (which excess is two hundred dollars ($200.00) in this illustration), equals three dollars ($3.00). The sum of six dollars ($6.00) and three dollars ($3.00) thus obtained, or nine dollars ($9.00), is then multiplied by twenty-five (25), (the number of years of service), to arrive at the monthly pension of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00). Pensions benefits of that class of employees having retired under this section prior to July 1, 1979, shall be increased by the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per annum. 
(3)  The sum of five (5) per cent of the salary or wages of officers and employees coming under the provisions of this section, and the subsections hereof, and who do not provide for the payment of a pension to a widow or minor child or children, shall be deducted from the salary or wages earned by such officers and employees during each calendar month. The sum of six (6) per cent of the salary or wages of officers and employees coming under the provisions of this section, and the subsections hereof, and who desire that the employee's widow or minor child or children succeed to the employee's rights as a pensioner (as authorized by sections 14-50 through 14-62) shall be deducted from the salary or wages earned by such officers and employees during each calendar month. 
(4)  With respect to officers and employees in the service of the city on the date the enactment from which this section is derived became effective, and who elect to come under the provisions of this section, the sums required to be paid as deductions from salary or wages under this section, and the subsections hereof, shall be deducted from all sums paid such officers and employees as salary or wages subsequent to the date on which the officer or employee files with the pension board a written application to elect to come under the provisions of this section. With respect to persons coming into the service of the city after such effective date, an employee's contributions shall commence after such employee's probationary period (as described in section 14-66) has been served. 
(5)  Any person in the service of the city on such effective date, who elects to come under the provisions of this section, and the subsections hereof, and who shall voluntarily retire within three (3) years immediately following such effective date, shall pay into the pension fund an amount which, when added to the amounts deducted by the city, will equal the total amount that would have been deducted during such three-year period had the person remained in the service of the city for the full three-year period at the salary or wages such employee was drawing at the time of such employee's retirement. Such payment shall be made within six (6) months after retirement. In case the required payment is not made within said six-month period, the pension board shall collect the amount by deductions from future pension payments, in such amounts as the board may fix, whether such payments are made to the employee or a surviving widow or children designated as beneficiary by the employee. Past due payments shall bear interest at six (6) per cent per annum. No payments shall be required in case of involuntary retirement, but shall be required in case of death of an employee, within three (3) years of the date of approval of this section, who has designated a widow or minor children as beneficiary to succeed to the employee's rights as a pensioner, where the widow or minor children designated are eligible for and actually receive pension payments. 
(6)  There is hereby added to section 14-79, following the sentence ending with the word "widowhood" at the end of such section, the following provisions: 
"Provided that if a widow of the pensioner receiving service pension benefits is more than five (5) years younger than the pensioner there shall be deducted from her pension one-twelfth of two (2) per cent per month for each month that she is more than five (5) years younger than the pensioner; provided, however, that said reduction of one-twelfth of two (2) per cent shall not apply if the widow is fifty-five (55) years or more of age at the time she becomes eligible for benefits. 
"The words minor 'child' or 'children' shall mean the natural or legally adopted minor child or children of an employee who were in life or adopted prior to the pensioner's retirement from active service." 
(7)  The following sentence contained in section 14-71, commencing in the eleventh line from the top of page 442 of said original act, is deleted in its entirety, to wit: "The amount of pension allowed for disability shall never exceed the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month in any instance." And the following is substituted in lieu thereof: "The amount of pension allowed for disability shall never exceed the sum of thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300.00) per annum with respect to employees in the employ of the city prior to July 1, 1965, who retain their status in the pension plan of the city as said plan existed prior to the year 1965." 
(8)  There is hereby added to this division the following provisions: "If an employee who has contributed to the pension fund and who has at least five (5) years of continuous service should resign or be dismissed from the city without having received or become eligible to receive a pension of any kind (except an employee displaced by a returning veteran), such employee shall be entitled to receive a refund of seventy-five (75) per cent of the total contributions made by the employee to the pension fund, and the payment by the pension board of such refund to such employee shall terminate such employee's rights under this law. Such refund shall be paid within ninety (90) days of the employee's date of termination of service; and should such an employee die before receiving said refund, said refund shall be paid to such employee's estate. No employee who has resigned or been dismissed from service with the city and who has been paid a refund of a portion of such employee's contributions to the pension fund, and who is reemployed by the city, shall be entitled to receive credit on such employee's service record for prior year's service until all of the amount received as refund (together with three (3) per cent interest per annum thereon from the date of terminating employment to date of repayment of the refund) shall be repaid to the pension fund; and such repayment must be made by the employee during such employee's lifetime and while in the employ of the city. 
"If an employee who has contributed to the fund should die without having received or become entitled to receive a pension of any kind under this law, and without leaving a qualified widow or minor child eligible to receive a pension of any kind under this law, the estate of such deceased employee shall be entitled to receive a refund of ninety-five (95) per cent of the total contributions made by the employee to the pension fund. No pension shall be paid under this division to any person except to a qualified employee or to the qualified widow or minor child or children of a qualified employee. 
"If any employee is discharged from employment by the city for the purpose of enabling a returning veteran to resume the position formerly held by said veteran, all contributions to the pension fund made by such displaced employee shall be refunded to such employee." 
(Code 1963, § 2-91) 
Editor's note- Senate Bill No. 79, 1965, § 1 amended the pension Act originally included in the charter and presently codified as this article by enacting the provisions codified as § 14-90 above. 
Sec. 14-91. - Annual appropriation in addition to matching fund. 
(a)  Effective July 22, 1974, the governing body shall have annually appropriated and paid into the pension fund an amount equal to the contributions previously required of the employee as set forth in the employees' selected pension plan. This payment shall be in lieu of the payment previously required of said employees, and shall be in addition to the matching fund required of the city. It is the intent of this provision that the city pay the entire sum required for the funding of the city employee pension fund. 
(b)  Any refund or estate benefit which an employee or such employee's estate becomes eligible to receive under the law prior to enactment of this amendment shall be limited to the actual contributions paid by said employee prior to this amendment.

Sec. 15-21. - Old National Corridor enterprise zone. 
(a)  Statement of findings. The mayor and council of the city find that: 
(1)  The area surrounding Old National Highway (the Old National Corridor) in the southern portion of the city is suffering from severe decline, disinvestment and encroaching blight; 
(2)  Unemployment levels surrounding the Old National Corridor are significantly higher, by at least ten (10) percent, than the state average unemployment rate; 
(3)  A disproportionately higher rate of crime exists in the Old National Corridor or Zone 3 of the city as compared with the remainder of the corporate limits; 
(4)  A total of five hundred eighty-six thousand six hundred fifty-five (586,655) square feet of retail space has been abandoned from January 1, 1997 to the present time along the Old National Corridor; 
(5)  The area surrounding Old National Corridor has seen the issuance of only two (2) land disturbance permits between 2003 and 2007; and that 
(6)  Without significant governmental intervention by the city, deterioration of the Old National Corridor area will most likely continue, resulting in an ever destabilized tax base, increased blight and ever-increasing crime rate for that area. 
(b)  Enterprise zone established; criteria of state met. 
(1)  There is hereby created and established the Old National Corridor Enterprise Zone. The boundaries of such Enterprise Zone are delineated on Exhibits A and B to Ord. No. 2003-06 which are incorporated herein by reference as fully as though set out at length. The Enterprise Zone shall also include the following tax parcels as identified in the tax records of Fulton County, Georgia: 
a.  13-0067-LL-075-6, and 
b.  13-0067-LL-079-8. 
(2)  The Old National Corridor Enterprise Zone, as configured herein, meets the criteria for establishment of enterprise zones under O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6. 
(c)  Definitions. In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this section, those terms defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-88-3 are incorporated by reference into this section and made a part hereof. 
(d)  Entitlement to incentives; standards; applicability. 
(1)  In order for a business or service enterprise to qualify for the incentives outlined in subsection (g), such business or service enterprise must, as an initial threshold, increase employment in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-88-4(b) at a physical facility located within the enterprise zone, in such manner as to provide additional economic stimulus in the zone. Additionally, the business or service enterprise must engage in new construction; make additions to existing structures; engage in substantial renovation of existing structures; make a significant investment in equipment replacement or expansion; or otherwise alter the physical premises in which the business or service enterprise operates in a manner which adds substantial value to the structures. Cosmetic changes or remodeling to the appearance of a structure which does not increase the assessed valuation of the property by more than twenty-five (25) per cent does not meet the construction or renovation standards of this paragraph. 
(2)  The determination of the number of increased full-time job equivalents required to qualify and whether a business or service enterprise qualifies for the incentives of this section shall be made on a case-by-case basis by the mayor and council upon application of the criteria established in this section. In making such determination, the mayor and council may rely upon information provided by the applicant, staff reports, economic studies, or other information determined by the mayor and council to provide a reliable indicator of economic stimulus. The burden shall be on an applicant to establish that the applicant meets the criteria set out in this section. 
(e)  Maintenance and continuation of qualifying criteria. In order to maintain the incentives established by this section, a qualifying business or service enterprise shall maintain the new full-time job equivalents for an entire ten-year period. Every qualifying business or service enterprise shall provide to the city's director of development by December 31 of each year a written report on the full-time job equivalents for that calendar year. The director of development shall be responsible for monitoring compliance by every qualifying business or service enterprise with this section. Failure to maintain the incentive qualification shall result in revocation and recapture of all incentives granted prior to the expiration of the incentive term. The agreement between the city and the qualifying business entered into pursuant to subsection (g)(1) shall include a clause granting the city's director of development to enter into the qualifying business facility at any time to audit and/or monitor compliance with this section. 
(f)  Duration of enterprise zone. The Old National Corridor Enterprise Zone shall be established effective with the date of re-adoption of this section [August 17, 2009] and shall continue for a period of ten (10) years.

Sec. 15-22. - Downtown Area enterprise zone. 
(a)  Statement of findings. The mayor and council of the City of College Park find that: 
(1)  The downtown area of the City of College Park, as described and defined in subsection (b) of this section (the "Downtown Area") is suffering from severe decline, disinvestment and encroaching blight; 
(2)  Unemployment levels surrounding the downtown area are significantly higher, by at least ten (10) per cent, than the state average unemployment rate; 
(3)  The downtown area has seen a seventy (70) per cent population decline, a sharp rise in dilapidated and/or abandoned structures and is generally in distress; 
(4)  The downtown area has pervasive poverty in that twenty-one (21) per cent of the population have incomes below the poverty index, and portions of the area show sixty (60) per cent of the population having income levels below the poverty index; 
(5)  The downtown area suffers from significant underdevelopment; 
(6)  Without significant governmental intervention by the city, deterioration of the downtown area will most likely continue, resulting in an ever destabilized tax base, increased blight and ever-increasing crime rate for that area. 
(b)  Enterprise zone established; criteria of state met. 
(1)  There is hereby created and established the Downtown Area Enterprise Zone. The boundaries of such Enterprise Zone are delineated on Exhibit A which is incorporated herein by reference as fully as though set out at length.

ARTICLE II. - RIDE SHARE 
DIVISION 1. - BIKE SHARING INFRASTRUCTURE 

Sec. 16-25. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The public health, safety and welfare will be enhanced by the implementation of a self-service bicycle rental program. The program, which will establish bike sharing infrastructure, both in the public right-of-way and on private property in the City of College Park, and which will be fully paid for by one or more vendors ("providers") selected by the city, will accomplish the city's goals of establishing a positive and useful program for the general public while eliminating city costs and expenses if the city were to directly implement the program. 
(b)  The location of bike share infrastructure on public property is intended to increase utilization of other public transit modes by providing a first mile and last mile travel alternative that will increase the range of destinations served. 
(c)  The bike sharing experience of the general public will be enhanced by the ability of the city to contract with providers to install and manage bike share infrastructure on public property including the public right-of-way for the installation around the city of multiple rental stations ("stations" or "kiosks") that house rental bicycles. 
(d)  The system will allow the general public to rent bicycles from stations located around the city, use a bicycle for trips of varying times and durations and return the bicycle to a different station. Such programs provide a convenience for residents, workers and visitors because bicycles are available on an as-needed basis and are available for one-way trips. The program, made available by the city, can operate on a cooperative basis and link with other programs sponsored by other entities to grow the system quickly and expand the reach of the program beyond the city.

(b)  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land; 
(c)  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat; 
(d)  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development; 
(e)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development; 
(f)  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community; 
(g)  To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions; 
(h)  To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood; 
(i)  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries; 
(j)  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles; 
(k)  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space; and 
(l)  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.

(b)  The written notice given to the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes shall notify such person of the public officer's determination the real property is being maintained in a blighted condition and shall advise such person of the hours and location at which the person may inspect and copy the public officer's determination and any supporting documentation.

ARTICLE V. - RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING 

Sec. 19-80. - Statement of findings. 
    The mayor and council finds that older residential areas of the city neighboring certain business, commercial, and educational uses have a shortage of parking as a result of minimal lot widths and high concentrations of visitors during certain hours. The result of such problems is that residents of the city have insufficient parking to accommodate their own vehicles. Additionally, in certain areas, as a result of parking congestion, there is insufficient space for movement of emergency vehicles to adequately respond in the event of emergency. The mayor and council find that such situations necessitate an innovative solution which will relieve parking congestion while supporting city neighborhoods.

(c)  Taxicabs providing taxicab services shall be subject to two (2) random inspections of taximeters per calendar year. The following will be inspected: 
Taximeter inspection criteria. All taxicabs shall comply with the following at all times, and all random inspections shall be conducted by the department at a designated location and time and shall consist of the following inspection: 
a.  Design of indicating elements. 
i.  Generally. A taximeter shall be equipped with a primary indicating element. 
ii.  Advancement of indicating elements. Except when a taximeter is being cleared, the primary indicating elements shall be susceptible of advancement only by the rotation of the vehicle wheels or by the time mechanism. 
iii.  Visibility of indications. Except when a taximeter is being cleared, indications of fare and extras shall be clearly shown on its face at all times and at least ten (10) millimeter high for the fare and four (4) millimeter high for all other indications. 
iv.  Actuation of fare-indicating mechanism. When a taximeter designed to calculate fares upon the basis of a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed is operative with respect to fare indication, the fare-indicating mechanism shall be actuated by the distance mechanism whenever the vehicle is in motion at such a speed that the rate of distance revenue equals or exceeds the time rate and may be actuated by the time mechanism whenever the vehicle speed is less than this and when the vehicle is not in motion. Means shall be provided for the vehicle operator to render the time mechanism either operative or inoperative with respect to the fare-indicating mechanism. 
b.  Operating condition. 
i.  Generally. Whenever the indicating elements of a taximeter are set to indicate a charge for the hire of the vehicle, the character of the fare indication shall be clearly shown on the taximeter face. When a taximeter is cleared, the indication "not registering," "vacant" or an equivalent expression shall be shown. 
ii.  Single-tariff taximeter. Whenever a single-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the indication "registering," "hired" or an equivalent expression shall be shown on the taximeter face. 
iii.  Multiple-tariff taximeter. Whenever a multiple-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the basis for the particular tariff for which it is set shall be shown on the taximeter face. 
iv.  Extra charges. Extra charges shall be indicated as a separate item and shall not be included in the fare indication. They shall be identified by the term "extras" or by an equivalent expression. Values shall be defined by suitable words or monetary signs. 
v.  Protection of indications. Indications of fare and extras shall be displayed on the taximeter face through and entirely protected by glass or other suitable transparent material securely attached to the housing of the taximeter. 
vi.  Basis of fare calculations. A taximeter shall calculate fares only upon the basis of distance traveled, time elapsed or a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed. 
c.  Design of operating control. 
i.  Means of control. A control lever-arm knob, handle or other convenient and effective means shall be provided to set the taximeter mechanism for the desired operating condition and to clear the taximeter. 
ii.  Positions of control. The several positions of the control lever shall be mechanically defined, and displacement from any of these positions shall be sufficiently obstructed that the accidental or inadvertent changing of the operating condition of the taximeter is improbable. Possible movement of this control to an operating position immediately following its movement to the cleared position shall automatically be delayed enough to permit the taximeter mechanism to come to complete rest in the cleared condition. 
d.  Provision for security seals. Adequate provision shall be made for affixing lead-and-wire seals to a taximeter and to other parts required for service operation of a complete installation on a vehicle so that no adjustments, alterations or replacements affecting in any way the accuracy or indications of the device or the assembly can be made without mutilating the seals. The sealing means shall be such that it is not necessary to disassemble or remove any part of the device or of the vehicle to apply or inspect the seals. 
e.  Distance test methods. To determine compliance with distance tolerances, a distance test of a taximeter shall be conducted utilizing a road test. 
f.  Tolerance values. 
i.  Distance tests. Maintenance and acceptance tolerances for taximeters shall be as follows: 
A.  On overregistration, one percent of the interval under test. 
B.  On underregistration, four percent of the interval under test, with an added tolerance of one hundred (100) feet or thirty (30) miles whenever the initial interval is included in the interval under test. 
ii.  Time tests on individual time intervals. Maintenance and acceptance tolerances on individual time intervals shall be as follows: 
A.  On overregistration, three (3) seconds per minute (five (5) percent). 
B.  On underregistration, nine (9) seconds per minute (fifteen (15) percent) on the initial interval and six (6) seconds per minute (ten (10) percent) on subsequent intervals. 
g.  Time mechanism tests. The time mechanism shall be tested at least through the first five (5) time intervals. 
h.  User requirements. 
i.  Position and illumination of taximeter. When mounted upon a vehicle, a taximeter shall be so located that its face can be seen by a passenger from the rear compartment of the vehicle. Adequate lighting facilities shall be provided for so illuminating the face of the taximeter that the indications thereof may be conveniently read by the passenger, and the face of the taximeter shall be so illuminated whenever the taximeter is in operation and artificial illumination is necessary for the convenient reading of its indications. 
ii.  Statement of rates. The distance and time rates for which a taximeter is adjusted shall be given. 
(d)  The regulatory fee shall encompass the fee(s) for inspections performed under this chapter. 
(e)  Taxicabs will be identified by their vehicle identification numbers (VIN) for purposes of inspections. 
(f)  At least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the date of inspection, the provider will be contacted by the department by certified mail, return receipt requested, at its last known address, and informed that a certain taxicab's inspection is to be performed at a certain date, time and location. Notwithstanding subsection (d) of this section, should such taxicab fail to appear at the designated location at the designated date, time and location, the provider and/or the driver of such taxicab is subject to a no-show fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
(g)  Should a taxicab fail any inspection, the taxicab shall be subject to random bi-weekly inspections until compliance is achieved. Notwithstanding subsection (d) of this section, the provider and/or driver of such taxicab shall pay a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per bi-weekly inspection under this subsection.

(a)  Engaging in the business of buying or accepting in barter or trade used or previously owned goods within the incorporated areas of College Park is hereby declared to affect the public interest due to the opportunity it affords for the disposal of stolen property. 
(b)  In the public interest and as set forth herein, all secondhand dealers shall maintain records in sequential order by transaction number documenting all secondhand transactions as set forth herein. 
(1)  All secondhand dealers shall document an accurate description of each article of property sold, bartered, or traded to the secondhand dealer. Such description shall include, to the extent possible, the manufacturer, model, serial number, style, material, kind, color, design, number of stones if jewelry, and all other identifying names, marks, and numbers. The secondhand dealer shall assign a sequential transaction number which shall follow the previous transaction number one by one with no numbers skipped or omitted, documenting each transaction, and ensure each item received is tagged with the transaction number. 
(2)  A well-focused, properly exposed, color digital photograph of each article sold, bartered or traded to the secondhand dealer shall be made at the time of acquisition of any article, and of each article's serial number if imprinted on the article, which number shall be clearly visible and readable in the images. If the article was never imprinted with any type of serial number, then the image shall show the entire article. All such digital images shall be labeled with the transaction number and stored in such a manner that they are safe from corruption, readily identifiable, and readily available for review. 
(3)  The tag bearing the transaction number must be created and remain attached to the item until the property is disposed of by sale, trade, or other lawful means. This subsection does not apply to the purchase of property from licensed wholesale or distributor businesses for the purpose of retail sales; however the secondhand dealer shall be required to maintain all purchasing records for property exempted from this subsection. 
(4)  All secondhand dealers shall require all persons selling, bartering, or trading property to show proper identification prior to conducting a secondhand dealer transaction. Proper identification is defined as a government issued photo identification card such as a driver's license, military identification card, state identification card, or passport. 
(5)  All secondhand dealers shall also document the name, address, telephone number, race, sex, height, weight, drivers' license or other government identification number, date of birth, and Social Security Number of the person selling, bartering, or trading the property, along with the date and time of the transaction. This documentation shall be made at the time of the transaction and labeled with the transaction number. 
(6)  All secondhand dealers shall take a well-focused, properly exposed, color digital photograph of the person selling, bartering, or trading the property. The photograph shall clearly show a frontal view of the subject's face along with the broker's ticket transaction number. Digital images shall be labeled with the transaction number and stored in such a manner that they are safe from corruption, readily identifiable, and readily available for review by law enforcement personnel. Such images shall be stored for a minimum period of four (4) years from the date of creation. 
(7)  All secondhand dealers shall obtain from each person selling, bartering, or trading any property, the fingerprint (using an electronic digital fingerprint scanner) of the right hand index finger, unless such finger is missing, in which event the print of the next finger in existence on the right hand shall be obtained with a notation as to the exact finger printed. The fingerprint shall be imprinted onto the transaction form in the designated area along with the signature of the person selling, bartering, or trading the property. The fingerprint must be clear and legible. In the event that more than one transaction form is required, a fingerprint and signature shall be obtained for each form. Fingerprints and the information required herein shall be obtained each time such person sells, barters, or trades any property. 
(8)  Items of property that appear to be new, unused, and in their original packaging cannot be accepted by the secondhand dealer unless the customer can supply a copy of the original sales receipt, or other proof of purchase from the place of purchase, to the secondhand dealer who shall retain the receipt or proof of purchase on file, labeled with the transaction number. 
(9)  All secondhand dealers shall store the above documentation, digital images, and digital fingerprints, which shall comprise the record of each transaction, together by the transaction number and shall maintain said records for a period of four (4) years and make them available to law enforcement personnel upon request. Both a hard copy and an electronic copy of these stored records shall be kept on-site, which must be kept safe from corruption, readily identifiable, and readily available for review, may, if otherwise permitted by law, serve as the permanent record of the secondhand dealer. 
(10)  All secondhand dealers shall enter the complete record of each transaction as it occurs into the electronic automated reporting system via the internet to the administrator of the electronic automated reporting system. The administrator of the electronic automated reporting system will electronically transmit all transactions to the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority.

Secondary dealers that incur electronic system failures or other events that would cause partial or complete loss of electronic reporting should notify the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority forthwith with the reason of the failure. In this event, the secondary dealers will be required to make records of transactions on paper forms. A digital camera will be used to collect the required pictures, which are to be transferred to a CD for submittal. The paper forms must include all information as enumerated in section 21-28(b). Secondary dealers shall maintain a minimum three (3) day supply of these paper forms. On a daily basis, all transactions not reported in the electronic automated reporting system will be delivered to the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority by the secondary dealer within two (2) hours of the end of the business day for every day until the disability or event has been corrected. Once the disability or event has been corrected, the secondhand dealer shall input the complete record of all transactions taken on paper forms into the automated reporting system via the internet to the administrator of the electronic automated reporting system. 
(e)  The secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority shall designate the required automated reporting system. There will be a regulatory fee assessed to each secondary dealer for each transaction: said fee shall be an amount of four dollars ($4.00) per transaction. The secondary dealer shall deduct this fee from the amount otherwise due to the seller at the time of the transaction and shall hold this fee in reserve to be paid to the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority on a weekly basis at the close of each business week. The total amount of regulatory fees collected each week shall be paid by the secondhand dealer to the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority at the close of each business week and shall be transmitted electronically or by check as approved by the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority. 
(f)  The amounts paid to the secondhand goods regulatory and monitoring authority as regulatory fees shall be expended first to cover the costs of the automated reporting system, including but not limited to its lease or purchase, installation, maintenance, and updates, then to cover or supplement the costs of regulating and monitoring secondhand dealers, pawn brokers, precious metals dealers, secondary metal recyclers, and like dealers, including but not limited to personnel and administrative costs, and for programs aimed at the reduction of burglary and theft related offenses.

(9)  The pawnbroker shall store the above documentation, digital images, and digital fingerprints, which shall comprise the record of each transaction, together by the transaction number and shall maintain said records for a period of four (4) years and make them available to law enforcement personnel upon request.

3.21 - Color. 
    The overall exterior color scheme shall be selected to be harmonious with the neighborhood and blend with the natural surroundings of the site. Consideration shall be given to the compatibility of colors with those existing in the vicinity. The size of the structure and the amount of shading it will receive are also a factor in selection of colors. 
A.  Color Hue. Any accent colors shall be of analogous tints, shades or tones. Accent colors may only be approved for very limited use where appropriate to highlight a feature of the design or provide visual interest. The number of such colors shall be limited to no more than two (2) and must be compatible within the overall color scheme. 
3.22 - Public Art. 
    Public art is a valuable design element found in many small towns and can include depictions of local scenery in the form of paintings, murals and mosaics.

    This section shall apply to all Transportation Districts, as the potential for negative visual impact on adjoining uses by Transportation District uses is substantial. Therefore, buffers are required for the protection of adjoining land uses. 
A.  A natural or man-made planted buffer shall be maintained along the property boundary of any "TR" District use which abuts a non-"TR" District use according to the following schedule: 
1.  Residential districts: A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of forty (40) feet shall be provided, provided that should the applicant wish to establish a bermed buffer, such buffer may be reduced to thirty (30) feet for a berm six (6) feet high and thirty (30) feet in depth. 
2.  Business park, office park and commercial uses: A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of thirty (30) feet shall be provided, provided that if the owner prefers, a six (6) feet high bermed buffer of twenty (20) feet in depth is allowable. 
B.  Buffers shall be permanently maintained as indicated on the approved site plan, subject to inspection by the building inspector, and consistent with any other property improvement. The dimension of the buffer shall not be in addition to any other landscaping requirements of this Article. 
C.  As the purpose of the buffer is to visually screen and distance the uses of the "TR" District from adjoining uses, one-half (1/2) of all plant materials shall consist of one (1) or more species that retain foliage throughout the year. Provision of opaque fencing, though desirable, shall not decrease the horizontal dimension of the required buffer. 
D.  Within the Transportation District, those uses identified as permitted uses may utilize the buffer requirement in computing the overall percentage of landscaping required by Article 9 of this ordinance. Internal landscaping of the area reserved for parking and paved for that purpose is not required, provided that no decrease in the overall percentage of landscaping on the lot shall be made.

3.53 - Architectural Design Standards. 
    Design emphasis is placed on building massing and scale. Massing will be reviewed in the context of building height, number of stories, roof configuration and building groupings. Scale of buildings shall be appropriate to the site in question as it relates to street frontage and pedestrians. New construction shall respect the traditional style of Downtown College Park and shall be in visual harmony with surrounding structures. When abutting established residential areas, as well as other buildings, structures and objects eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places: New construction, additions, and renovations shall respect and maintain the character and sense of place that defines the neighborhood. 
A.  Building Height, Width, Mass and Scale. Building heights and widths shall relate to the existing fabric of downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. 
1.  Widths of buildings are encouraged to consist of three (3) to seven (7) bays (window and door divisions). 
2.  New buildings that are wider than existing structures shall incorporate a number of smaller bays into the primary façade, to maintain a cohesive scale. 
3.  Buildings in excess of three (3) stories or thirty-five (35) feet in height may be appropriate within two thousand (2,000) feet of the College Park MARTA station, subject to a conditional height permit. 
4.  Building heights of larger projects shall provide variety. A larger (taller) development shall step down in height to a maximum of thirty-five (35) feet when adjacent to a street with shorter structures on the opposite side or when adjacent to smaller, surrounding structures. 
5.  Large lots are encouraged to be developed with several buildings, rather than a single structure in order to help reduce the perceived size of the project. 
B.  Orientation. All front façades of the principal building shall face and be parallel to a public street. 
1.  Primary building entrances on all buildings should face on a public street, walkway, or plaza, or linked to that street by a clearly defined and visible walkway or courtyard. 
2.  Additional secondary entrances should be oriented to a secondary street or parking area. 
3.  Residential entries should be separate and distinct from commercial entrances. 
4.  Entrances should be clearly identifiable and open directly onto a public sidewalk or plaza. 
5.  Primary entrances should be oriented towards transit. 
6.  The main entrance of a corner building should be placed on a diagonal and oriented to the intersection. 
7.  Non-residential building entries should be designed with one (1) or more of the following: 
a.  Canopy, portico, overhang, arcade or arch above the entrance. 
b.  Recesses or projections in the building facade surrounding the entrance. 
c.  Display windows surrounding the entrance. 
d.  Architectural detailing such as brickwork or ornamental moldings. 
e.  Planting areas, pots or window boxes for seasonal landscaping. 
f.  Use of porches, steps, overhangs, hooded front doors or similar architectural elements to define the primary entrances to all residences. 
C.  Building Façade. A variety of sizes is appropriate among primary façades in new developments. 
1.  Variations in facade treatment shall be continued through the structure, including its roof line and front and rear facades to reduce the perceived size of the building. 
2.  A monotonous appearance of a large building or single façade shall be minimized through the use of architectural elements within the façade which include masonry piers, stepping of the building height and width, different colors or textures, and the variation of windows and awnings. 
3.  Building design shall create positive open space in these variations such that they will enhance the streetscape. 
4.  Blank lengths of wall exceeding fifteen (15) linear feet are prohibited on all building façades. 
5.  Buildings should have a well-defined front façade with primary entrances facing the street. 
6.  Buildings should be aligned so that the dominant lines of their facades parallel the line of the street, creating a well-defined street edge with variation rather than monolithic design. 
7.  New building facades should have a pedestrian scale aesthetic. This can be accomplished by establishing rhythmic patterns and architectural elements such as windows, columns, rooflines, signage, building materials and colors. 
8.  The primary façade(s) (portion viewable by the public from streets and parking lots) of buildings should be articulated into smaller increments through the following or similar techniques: 
a.  Stepping back or extending upper floors, 
b.  Dividing facades into multiple storefronts with separate display windows and entrances, 
c.  Providing awnings, canopies, window bays, balconies or similar ornamental features, and 
d.  Varying rooflines to reinforce the articulation of the primary façade. 
D.  Buildings are viewed from a variety of vantage points. Consequently the placement of doors, windows, balconies, changes in materials, or roof height, etc. should be designed to provide an attractive and harmonious design on all sides. 
E.  Rear facades should be designed as an integral part of the overall building with similar materials and detail treatments. 
F.  In general, buildings over two (2) stories should have well-defined horizontal architectural elements such as building base, middle and roofline. 
G.  The base, or ground floor, should appear visually distinct from the upper stories, through the use of a change in building materials, window shape or size, an intermediate cornice line, an awning, arcade or portico, or similar techniques. 
H.  Portions of upper stories (above the typical design character of the community) should be stepped back from the line of the front façade to minimize the impacts of taller structures. Outdoor terraces, rooftop patios, etc., should be elements occupying the space created by such step-back. 
I.  Architectural details such as ornamental cornices, arched windows and warm-toned bands of contrasting materials/color are encouraged in new construction. The contemporary adaptation of historic and vernacular residential, institutional and commercial styles found elsewhere in the municipality is encouraged. 
J.  New Construction. New buildings shall incorporate recessed entryways into the design of the building to prevent impeding pedestrian traffic along the sidewalk while a door is opened to enter a commercial building. 
1.  The entryway shall be set back from the edge of the sidewalk four (4) to eight (8) feet and may make use of display cases and window panes to integrate this feature into the design of the building. 
2.  Buildings located on corner lots shall incorporate design features to provide architectural interest for side walls that are not considered part of the primary façade. 
3.  There shall be no exposed plain concrete block for visible portions of all façades. 
4.  Tilt up or precast concrete shall be textured with brick, aggregates, form liners, or similar methods to give visual interest to larger expanses of wall. 
5.  Landscaping elements shall also be added to break up larger expanses of wall.

7.  Where general office uses front public rights-of-way, a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the affected building façade shall consist of transparent or translucent surfaces. 
K.  Roofs. Roofs shall be designed as follows: 
1.  The form and pitch of the roof of new construction and additions to existing buildings shall be proportionate to surrounding structures. 
2.  During roof repair and replacement, new materials shall match existing materials in scale and texture. 
3.  Parapets shall be embellished with detailing and stepped or sloped to achieve a visually interesting yet harmonious sequence along the building façade. 
4.  Flat roofs shall be defined with a discernible cornice line. Variations in roof type, height, and or distinct, separate roof segments should be considered as a means of creating greater visual interest, identifying changes in use and areas of ownership, or reducing monotony. 
5.  Pitched roofs such as gable, hip, shed or mansard roofs shall be clad with highly durable materials such as standing seam metal, slate, ceramic or fireproof composite tiles. Use of asphalt shingles is discouraged. 
6.  Rooflines shall reflect interior and exterior patterns of use or ownership. 
7.  Roof ornamentation shall carefully consider sight lines and not allow any views of unsightly surfaces. 
L.  Windows and Doors. Architectural design of the structure shall determine the window and door styles selected for a project. 
1.  Windows and doors shall follow appropriate rhythm and scale for building massing and frontage, including a pedestrian friendly focus. 
2.  The arrangement, size and style of windows and doors shall be proportionate in scale to surrounding structures.

c.  Service windows and stacking lanes. 
3.54 - Open Space and the Public Realm. 
A.  Design Principles. 
1.  All new open space should be designed to easily integrate into the public pedestrian circulation system. 
2.  New open space in the transit station area should contribute to the public's safety and provide direct pedestrian access to transit whenever possible. 
3.  Open space should be easily accessible to pedestrians. Fences, gates, and signs that create obstacles for pedestrians should be avoided. 
4.  Bollards, trees, and other street furniture should be used to protect pedestrians and buildings. 
5.  Comfortable and attractive street furniture that is accessible to the physically disabled should be provided in public spaces for public enjoyment and comfort. Street furniture should not be in the main pedestrian walkway. 
6.  Public art or amenities (such as sculpture, fountains, murals, artist-designed street furnishings, etc.) should be integrated into all new development regardless if the development is publicly or privately funded. 
B.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be designed as follows: 
1.  Size and spacing of landscaping elements shall be consistent with pedestrian-scale development, relate to identifiable streetscapes, and ease the transition between all structures and the pedestrian. 
2.  Plant materials and containers shall not encroach upon the minimum five (5) feet pedestrian clear zone that must be maintained on the sidewalk. 
3.  The use of window boxes, planters, hanging flower baskets, vines and other seasonal landscaping is encouraged. Window boxes, hanging baskets and planters shall be used around entries, while vines should be used to cover blank walls or other surfaces. All hanging baskets shall provide at least eight (8) feet of vertical clearance for pedestrians. 
4.  Landscaping shall be designed to coordinate with building height; designers shall use foresight to identify how plants will look at maturity. 
5.  Landscaping shall not only apply to the fronts of buildings, but to the sides and rear as well. Buildings with rear entries or rear parking shall strive to make the entrances as neat and well maintained as the front entrance. 
6.  Landscape shading shall minimize large areas of un-shaded pavement. Pavement materials must be chosen for minimal reflected light and glare. The use of pervious materials is strongly encouraged to reduce surface water flows and non-point source water pollution. Sidewalks and pathways shall be designed with concrete and decorative pavers around the border and must be approved by the Engineering Director. 
7.  Plant materials along streets and highways shall be selected and placed to avoid blocking sight lines at intersections and curb cuts. Plantings along utility rights-of-way shall not disrupt service or access to overhead or underground equipment and lines. 
C.  Transitional Buffers. Transitional buffers are intended to be used in a manner that allows for compatible residential and commercial growth in Downtown College Park.

    Street trees shall be required as follows: 
1.  Street trees shall be planted in conjunction with each new development project. 
2.  Trees shall be spaced a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet on center, depending on species, to provide a more-or-less continuous canopy along the sidewalk. 
3.  Required street trees shall be shade trees. However, other types may be used if approved by the City Planner. 
4.  A minimum planting area or grating of at least three (3) by three (3) feet shall accompany all street trees. 
    Tree maintenance, pruning and dead tree replacement schedule and responsibilities shall be designated in consultation with the city. 
3.57 - Outdoor Dining. 
    Outdoor seating for restaurants in and outside of the downtown area is an attractive feature and is highly encouraged. It maintains the historic feel of the area by bringing restaurant patrons into the public realm while dining. However, standards must be in place to ensure this practice does not infringe on the rights of others. 
1.  Restaurants may place one (1) row of tables outside their place of business unless the building setback permits a greater number of rows. These tables shall be placed adjacent to the front wall of the building, fronting the public right-of-way.

10.  Provide bicycle parking in commercial and recreational areas. 
11.  Incorporate Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) design guidelines for older drivers and pedestrians. 
3.59 - Lighting. 
    Good outdoor lighting serves a number of uses by increasing safety and enhancing the city's nighttime character. However, improperly designed and/or installed lighting can create problems of excessive glare, light trespass, decreased safety and higher energy use. These standards are established to define appropriate lighting characteristics. 
A.  General Lighting Guidelines. 
1.  Lighting shall be designed to control glare, minimize light trespass onto adjacent properties, minimize direct upward light emission, promote effective security, and avoid interference with safe operation of motor vehicles. The minimum intensity needed for the intended purpose shall be used. This paragraph is not intended to preclude the use of decorative lantern fixtures with visible lamps. 
2.  All parking areas, walkways, vehicle entrances and service/loading areas shall provide area lighting sufficient to achieve a minimum of 2.4 foot candles of light as measured at grade or ground level. 
3.  Lighting fixtures in parking areas shall be located to assure adequate light levels without displacing planned trees. Light fixture placement shall be shown on landscape plans. 
4.  Lighting fixture height, style, design and illumination levels shall be compatible with the building design and height and shall consider safety, function and aesthetics. Lighting fixtures installed along sidewalks shall be pedestrian scale and shall not exceed fourteen (14) feet. 
5.  Lighting may be used to illuminate buildings, landscaped medians/islands and grounds for safety purposes and to enhance appearance. The visual effects of such lighting shall be subtle. 
6.  Lighting attached to building exteriors or mounted on the ground to reflect upon building exteriors shall be consistent with the architectural style of the building.

DIVISION 17. - "T" TRANSPORTATION OVERLAY DISTRICT 

3.60 - Scope; purpose. 
A.  Scope. The regulations set forth in this article, or set forth elsewhere in this ordinance when referring to this article, are the regulations of the "T" Transportation Overlay District. 
B.  Purpose. 
1.  The purpose of the Transportation Overlay District is to provide for the regulation of vehicle parking facilities which either serve as the primary use of a parcel of property or are unrelated to the primary use of such property. These facilities include, but are not limited to, airport parking and shuttle services, car rental agencies and offsite airport related employee parking. College Park's proximity to the airport, as well as access provided by the transportation system, make it a prime location for development of such enterprises. In addition, displacement of past uses of properties adjoining Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport have created large tracts of vacant land near the airport suitable to meet this market demand. 
2.  Proliferation of such facilities in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner is not in the best interest of the City of College Park. Such facilities involve vast areas of pavement characterized by three unique features, i.e., a visual "sea of cars", significant stormwater runoff and introduction of significant vehicle traffic. Improper location of such facilities results in negative impact on traffic patterns as well as a strong negative visual impact on surrounding development. Establishment of a Transportation Overlay District which will accommodate such facilities in a concentrated, accessible location is preferred in order to ameliorate the negative effects of such uses. Accordingly, this "single purpose" district is established to concentrate such facilities in specific locations, to buffer such facilities by perimeter landscaping, thereby minimizing the visual impact on the traveling public and surrounding development. Concentration of such facilities further allows economies in the provision of common stormwater detention facilities which might otherwise be constructed on individual sites. 
3.  This district is intended as an overlay district allowing establishment of vehicle parking facilities within the configuration of the allowable T-District boundaries in BP, OP, C-2, C-3, HC; M-1 and M-2 Districts. Uses otherwise authorized as permitted uses in the underlying district continue as permitted uses. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.61 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them: 
1.  Airport parking and shuttle services mean those parking facilities designed primarily to serve Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. Such facilities allow parking for a fee on an hourly, daily, weekly or other periodic basis and may provide shuttle services between the parking facility and the airport terminal or other airport use. Commercial parking lots which primarily serve the airport and its related activities but which do not provide shuttle services are nonetheless included in this definition. 
2.  Car rental agencies mean those businesses which have as their primary purpose, or as a significant purpose, the furnishing of motor vehicles for hire on a periodic basis and which store vehicles pending their rental so that such vehicles may be available for rental or lease. 
3.  Airport related employee parking means parking, whether privately owned or governmentally owned, reserved for employees of Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport or employees working for any person, firm or corporal provides airport related services associated with the airport. 
4.  Vehicle parking facilities means surface lots or parking decks dedicated for the parking of vehicles either as a primary use of a parcel of property or as a secondary use of property unrelated to the property's primary use. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.62 - Use regulations. 
    The following uses are permitted in the Transportation Overlay District: 
1.  Airport parking and shuttle services; 
2.  Car rental agencies;

(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.63 - Parking and loading regulations. 
    In addition to the parking spaces made available to the public or other persons designated to use such parking facilities, the following parking and loading requirements shall be established for the underlying business: 
1.  Employee parking: A minimum of one (1) space per employee on the shift of greatest employment. 
2.  Loading space: A minimum of one (1) loading space in conformity with article III of this appendix. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.64 - Height limits. 
    No building or parking deck shall exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.65 - Area regulations. 
A.  Front yards. There shall be a front yard having a depth of not less than forty (40) feet. 
B.  Side yards. There shall be a side yard having a depth of not less than twenty (20) feet; provided that where such use adjoins the outer perimeter of the "T" District, such side yard may not be less than thirty (30) feet. 
C.  Rear yards. There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than twenty (20) feet; provided that where the use adjoins the outer perimeter of the Transportation District such rear yard shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet. 
D.  Within the Transportation District no parking, whether on surface lots or in parking decks, shall be permitted in any of the required yard setbacks. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.66 - Buffers. 
A.  The potential for negative visual impact on adjoining uses by Transportation District uses is substantial. Therefore, buffers are required for the protection of adjoining land uses. 
B.  A natural or man-made planted buffer shall be maintained along the property boundary of any "T" District use which abuts a non-"T" District use according to the following schedule: 
1.  Residential districts: A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of forty (40) feet shall be provided, provided that should the applicant wish to establish a bermed buffer, such buffer may be reduced to thirty (30) feet for a berm six (6) feet high and thirty (30) feet in depth. 
2.  Business park, office park and commercial uses: A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of thirty (30) feet shall be provided, provided that if the owner prefers, a six (6) feet high bermed buffer of twenty (20) feet in depth is allowable. 
C.  Buffers shall be permanently maintained as indicated on the approved site plan, subject to inspection by the building inspector, and consistent with any other property improvement. The dimension of the buffer shall not be in addition to any other landscaping requirements of this article. 
D.  As the purpose of the buffer is to visually screen and distance the uses of the "T" District from adjoining uses one-half (1/2) of all plant materials shall consist of one (1) or more species that retain foliage throughout the year. Provision of opaque fencing, though desirable, shall not decrease the horizontal dimension of the required buffer. 
E.  Within the Transportation District, those uses identified as permitted uses may utilize the buffer requirement in computing the overall percentage of landscaping required by Article XI-C of this appendix. Internal landscaping of the area reserved for parking and paved for that purpose is not required, provided that no decrease in the overall percentage of landscaping on the lot shall be made. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.67 - Parking area layout, construction and maintenance, and landscape requirements. 
    All provisions of Article VIII of this Ordinance shall apply to the Transportation District, provided that internal landscaping may be eliminated for the permitted uses in the Transportation District so long as the overall percentage of landscaping required is not diminished for the lot. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.68 - Buses and large commercial vehicles. 
    Where ten (10) per cent or more of the available parking space is to be utilized by buses, vans, or other vehicles of a gross weight of excess of three thousand five hundred (3,500) pounds, additional screening shall be provided sufficient to screen the parking of such oversized vehicles from all adjacent uses. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.69 - Installation of parking decks. 
    Where an owner within the "T" District seeks to construct a parking deck, such deck shall be constructed in accordance with all building codes and fire safety codes in effect within the City of College Park. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.70 - Site plan review. 
    A site plan shall be submitted to the building inspector for all development under this Article. Such site plan shall show the parking layout meeting the requirements of "parking space" of Article III of this appendix and the design requirements of Article XI-C of this appendix for access driveways and turnaround. Additionally, the site plan shall show the proposed landscaping and the hydrology elements necessary to meet the city's Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. The site plan shall be accompanied by a traffic study. 
(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
3.71 - Non-conforming lots. 
    Vehicle parking facilities, as defined by this Article, in existence in the city at the time of enactment of this Ordinance which are permitted uses under the "T" District but which are not located within such district shall be nonconforming uses and subject to Article XVIII of this Appendix. No expansion of a nonconforming parking facility may be made which extends its perimeter boundaries on the ground; i.e., where existing boundaries of a parking facility touch the proposed expansion on two (2) or more sides of a lot, the additional lot may be included within the parking facility. Upward expansion by installation of parking decks in permitted for nonconforming uses under this section. 

(Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 3-18-19) 
ARTICLE 4. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT 

4.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Planned Development Zoning District is to encourage innovative approaches to site planning and land development. A planned development ("PD") is a professionally planned residential or commercial district or an integration of such uses fostering design flexibility and diversity. PDs are intended to achieve economies in land use, public improvements and services delivery while preserving open space and protecting natural areas. The PD encourages large scale, unified development of compatible land uses, accessed by intermodal circulation systems. 
4.2 - Types of Planned Developments. 
    Two (2) types of Planned Development Districts accommodating primarily residential or nonresidential uses are created as follows: 
1.  PD-R Planned Development Residential: The PD-R District is intended to accommodate primarily residential uses, with nonresidential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses. 
2.  PD-C Planned Development Commercial: The PD-C District is intended to accommodate primarily nonresidential uses, with residential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses. 
4.3 - Standards for Consideration of a Planned Development. 
A.  Any property meeting the standards of this Article may be zoned as a PD, provided that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  A combination of principal land uses, not otherwise permitted within the same zoning district, is proposed for development on one (1) or more adjacent tracts. 
2.  Variances concerning required development standards, or other regulations of the College Park Zoning Ordinance, would otherwise be necessary to achieve design flexibility. 
3.  Environmental design (i.e., architectural standards and site development standards) proposed is of a higher quality than would be possible under regulations otherwise applicable to the property. 
4.  Economical provision of public services will result. 
5.  The resulting transportation system will encourage and facilitate pedestrians and bicycles as practical alternatives to the proliferation of motorized vehicles. 
B.  In addition, two (2) or more of the following objectives must be met: 
1.  Diversity in the range of permitted uses and variety in the relationship of uses, structures and open space in developments planned as cohesive unified objects. 
2.  Preservation of natural features. 
3.  Enhanced functional and beneficial use of open space. 
4.  Creation of a variety of housing types compatible with surrounding neighborhoods, resulting in a greater choice of environments and dwelling units. 
5.  Provision of attractive and appropriate locations for business uses in well-designed buildings with provision of employment opportunities near residential areas. 
4.4 - Maximum Area of Commercial or Service Uses in PD-R Districts. 
    In PD-R Districts in which commercial or service uses are permitted, the acreage of land devoted to commercial or service uses, including structures, parking, and related characteristics and accessory uses thereto shall not exceed thirty-five (35) percent of the total area. Provided, however, that such percentage shall apply only to commercial and service uses, and not to other nonresidential uses such as schools, parks, community buildings, and public facilities. Required parking for commercial and service uses shall be counted towards the maximum percentage. 
4.5 - Permitted Uses. 
    The applicant may propose various integrated uses, such as neighborhood commercial services, within a residential area. The planning commission shall determine the appropriateness of such proposals during the preliminary development plan review process. An approved development plan for a PD shall establish the requirements for guiding development and uses of property within the PD, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  All uses in the R-1, R-2, R-3, MF, BP, and OP Districts are permitted in any PD. M-1 uses proposed for a PD-C shall be considered as conditional uses. 
2.  Mixed-use or integrated use areas may be permitted provided that buffers as established in this Article are maintained. Proposed uses must be specified in the preliminary and final development plans, and, once approved by the planning commission and mayor and council, the final development plan shall govern development within the district. 
3.  Multifamily uses shall not be located along the perimeter of a PD, except where adjacent to, or across a street from, an existing multifamily or more intense use. Multifamily units shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the total number of dwelling units in a PD-R. 
4.6 - Density. 
A.  The density for single-family detached residential development in PD-R Districts shall not exceed six (6) units per acre, and the density for multifamily, residential development in PD-R Districts shall not exceed twelve (12) units per acre. Residential project density shall be calculated by considering only land designated for residential development, together with associated and adjacent common open space and recreation areas. Areas classified as drainage or retention facilities shall not be considered as common open space. Density shall be calculated by dividing the number of units by number of acres designated for residential development. Density shall be calculated separately for each housing type. Notwithstanding the above, net density ratios in excess of those provided by this subsection may be approved, provided the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed density is compatible with the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and the residential character of surrounding development in College Park, or that negative impacts will be mitigated through landscaping, site design or other techniques. 
B.  The lot coverage, regarding building footprint, for development in PD-C District not within the Downtown Historic District shall not exceed sixty-five (65) percent. 
C.  In the Downtown Historic District no lot coverage limitations apply; provided that open space and parking are met. 
4.7 - Building Height. 
    Building height shall not exceed three (3) stories or thirty-five (35) feet, whichever is greater, unless a conditional height zoning permit is granted. 
4.8 - Development Standards. 
    Development standards for any PD, including lot area, site dimensions, required yards, density, site coverage, landscaping and parking shall be explicitly proposed by the applicant and be approved by the mayor and council, provided such proposal does not fall below the standards of this Article. 
A.  Minimum tract size. The minimum size for any PD shall be ten (10) acres. 
B.  Public facilities. The applicant shall demonstrate that adequate public facilities will be provided to serve the PD. Such facilities at a minimum shall include, but not be limited to, water supply, sewage disposal, drainage control, roads, sidewalks and bike lanes. Any extension of public facilities shall be designated to avoid inefficiency, duplication, premature extensions, and unnecessary public costs. The applicant shall be solely responsible for installation of these public facilities in conformance with city standards and at the applicant's expense; provided that where such PD encompasses a portion of an Urban Redevelopment Area established by the mayor and council pursuant to the Urban Redevelopment Law, the city may elect, at its sole discretion, to joint venture in the cost and/or installation of public facilities where it determines such action is necessary to facilitate redevelopment of a blighted area. 
C.  Underground utilities. PDs must include underground installation of all utilities, including, at a minimum, telephone, electric power and cable television in both public and private right-of-way, except when extreme conditions of underlying rock or other conditions make this requirement unreasonable. 
D.  Construction standards. Streets, sidewalks, water supply, sanitary sewer and drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations of College Park and design and construction standards adopted by the city, unless otherwise approved by the Engineering Director in accordance with standards established in Table II, below. The minimum right-of-way for all streets shall be fifty (50) feet. Entry streets accessing the PD and commercial streets shall be a minimum of twenty-eight (28) feet paved width for commercial streets. Residential streets shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) paved feet in width; provided that where a PD proposes utilizing existing streets of lesser width, the pavement width may be reduced to twenty (20) feet curb to curb upon certification by the Engineering Director in consultation with other department heads that emergency vehicle access will not be impaired. Street width dimensions shall be subject to approval by the Engineering Director. A minimum height clearance of thirteen and one-half (131/2) feet shall be maintained over all streets. All streets shall have vertical curbs. 
E.  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed along the entire frontage of all developments. Sidewalks adjacent to residential properties shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width; sidewalks adjacent to commercial properties shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width. Pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided and clearly marked at intersections serving residential developments. Crosswalks serving commercial developments shall be identified through the use of pavement materials such as stone pavers which differentiate the crosswalk from the normal street surface. Pedestrian crossing control devices shall be provided at all signalized intersections. 
F.  Parking regulations. Off-street parking requirements are as provided in Table I, below. Commercial parking requirements may be reduced provided that off-street parking which is specifically owned or leased by the property owner seeking the reduction is located within four hundred (400) feet, as measured along the sidewalk, of the use such parking is intended to serve. 
All off-street parking proposed for a PD must comply with the landscape provisions of Article 9, Tree Protection of this ordinance. In addition, a landscaped area having a minimum width of ten (10) feet shall be installed between parking areas and residential units in attached dwelling developments.

No phase shall be approved which is dependent upon any future phase for road access, public facilities or services, parking or common open spaces. 
4.9 - Design Criteria. 
    Design criteria shall be used as the principal tool in evaluating the merits of a proposed PD. The burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed development plans comply with each of the following criteria, or alternately, to demonstrate that one (1) or more of these criteria are not applicable, or that a practical solution consistent with the public interest and other purposes of the College Park Zoning Ordinance has been achieved: 
A.  Conformance to the Comprehensive Plan. The proposed development plan shall conform to applicable elements of the College Park Comprehensive Plan and city goals and policies expressed therein and elsewhere. 
B.  Compatibility with surrounding development. Proposed uses, activities and densities shall have a compatible, efficient and functional interrelationship to surrounding uses and activities, and shall not adversely affect future development of the surrounding area. 
C.  Development scale. Any nonresidential uses in a PD-R shall be of a scale primarily to meet commercial and service needs generated within the PD and those of the immediate area. Large-scale, retail uses which will draw patrons and/or vehicle trips primarily from communities outside College Park are discouraged. Market studies and traffic impact analyses may be required of the applicant as evidence that the proposal meets this criterion. 
D.  Environmental design. Site plan, building design and location, and open space provisions shall be designed to produce a development that is responsive and sensitive to natural features and the aesthetic quality of the community. Site planning and design shall minimize any required cut or fill to afford maximum protection of natural landforms and features. Natural features and/or geologic hazards that may affect the property on which the PD is proposed shall be identified and mitigation measures established. Building design shall maximize preservation of vegetation and landforms, enhance drainage and minimize soil erosion. Developments must consider designs for foot traffic and pedestrian movement in and among individual retail and office establishments that facilitate destination environments for shoppers and employees. The following design principles shall control development in the PD: 
1.  Non-retail commercial buildings shall, to the extent possible, front directly onto the public sidewalk and provide direct pedestrian access thereto. 
2.  Site access for vehicles shall be configured such that pedestrians are not required to traverse parking areas or vehicular drives to approach the entry. Pavement markings identifying pedestrian walks may be used to achieve this design standard. 
3.  All buildings shall provide direct pedestrian access from on-site parking areas as well as the public sidewalk system. 
4.  All retail commercial buildings must front directly on the sidewalk, adhering to a zero front yard setback and forming a generally uniform edge identifying the retail commercial storefronts. A front yard having a maximum depth of twenty (20) feet may be approved, provided pedestrian or patron amenities are featured within the front yard. 
E.  Intermodal transportation. The intent of the PD is to plan a hierarchy of streets, walks and paths that equitably serves the needs of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. All PD proposals shall accommodate alternative transportation modes, including mass transit, bicycle and pedestrian options. This shall include the design of a pedestrian and bikeway system, including such facilities as lighting, landscaping, signs, benches, paved surfaces, and bike racks. 
F.  Architectural standards. An architectural design plan which ensures architectural consistency in the proposed development, architectural character, and preservation or improvement of the visual character of the city shall be provided and, upon approval, shall form part of the plan. Architectural character is based upon the suitability of a building for its purposes, the appropriate use of materials, and upon principles of harmony and proportion of the building with other proposed buildings and surrounding land uses. Buildings or other improvements shall be compatible with the orientation, directional emphases, shape, volume, massing, proportion, rhythm, scale and materials of the context, setting and streetscape of the site. Architectural elements, designs, concepts, building styles and materials shall be subject to review by a design review commission as established by the city to ensure consistency with the purposes and provisions of the PD. In the absence of a design review commission, architectural review shall be by a committee composed of the City Planner, building inspector, downtown development manager, director of development and city manager. 
The following requirements shall control building construction in the PD: 
1.  Building materials used for exterior finishes shall consist of glass; metal; brick; stone; concrete stucco; decorative concrete block; solid wood; "Hardy" board or similar masonry applications; or similar, durable architectural materials.

Awning materials shall be limited to canvas or metal. 
2.  Roof pitch in residential developments shall be a minimum of 6/12. Roof materials shall consist of asphalt or composite shingles, terra cotta, slate, cedar, or standing seam metal. "Rolled" asphalt-roofing materials shall not be used. 
3.  Side and rear building elevations of attached, residential developments and all commercial developments shall be substantially consistent with the front building elevation. 
4.  Architectural style within one (1) block or other contiguous development unit shall be compatible and shall adhere to a single, consistent architectural theme. 
5.  Placement of air-conditioning units, satellite dishes in excess of one (1) meter in diameter and other mechanical systems and equipment shall be accomplished without detracting from the architectural integrity of the building or site. Generally, such equipment must be installed to the rear of the building or on the side, provided the view is partially obstructed through either the use of screening compatible with the building such equipment serves or landscaping. Rooftop equipment shall be completely screened from view from the public right-of-way as well as adjoining properties. 
G.  Access for the disabled. All buildings intended for use by the general public shall be designed and constructed so that they are accessible and useable by physically disabled individuals. Site development and building construction shall conform to specifications set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
4.10 - Common Open Spaces. 
    Common open spaces shall be defined for the purpose of this section as the total area of land and water within the external boundary of a PD designated and intended for use and enjoyment as open areas, and not improved with a building, structure, street, road or parking area, except for recreational structures and parking for recreational uses. Said common open spaces shall not include individual lots and yards located between buildings and parking areas. 
A.  Minimum open space requirement. A minimum of twenty (20) per cent of the area of the PD-R District (fifteen (15) per cent of PD-C Districts), net of all street rights-of-way, parking areas, and the below listed areas of this subsection, shall be common open spaces. Acreage delineated by utility easements containing overhead lines shall be factored into neither the calculation of the common open space reservation, nor the net area of the PD. 
B.  Ineligible areas and uses. No area within a building site (other than recreation structures), road and road easement or right-of-way, cut or fill slope, drainage facility such as detention ponds, or other permanently disturbed area shall be credited toward the required per cent permanent, common open space requirement. Recreational uses which alter the natural landscape, and are not available to the general public, such as golf courses, shall not constitute more than fifty (50) percent of the minimum twenty-five (25) or fifteen (15) percent common open space reservation. 
C.  All common open space shall be reserved for its intended purpose as shown on the approved, final development plan. The common open space shall either be dedicated to the city, subject to acceptance by the City of College Park, or administered by a nonprofit organization, subject to the requirements of this Article. 
D.  All common open space shall be specifically included in the development schedule, and be constructed and fully improved by the owner at an equivalent or greater rate than construction of all other structures proposed in the approved final development plan. 
E.  Areas proposed for common open space or recreation areas shall be allocated among the various land uses in proportion to the ratio of neighborhood or employment population to total PD population so that acreage devoted to open space and recreation is reasonably accessible to all residents and daytime occupants of the PD. 
F.  Civics spaces in all PDs, including public squares and parks which feature focal points such as fountains, public artwork and other amenities designed for passive recreation, must be incorporated into common open spaces. No residence in a PD-R shall be located more than five hundred (500) feet from a common open space area comprised of a minimum area of one-quarter (1/4) acre.

A.  Access to public thoroughfares. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to permit smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Minor streets within the PD shall generally not be connected to streets outside the development, except where an existing street grid already exists, it shall be maintained and no access to adjacent areas shall be discontinued. 
B.  Site accessibility. PDs shall normally be located on a street having a minimum functional classification of "collector." All proposed streets, alleys and driveways shall be adequate to serve the residents, occupants, visitors, emergency and service vehicles, and other anticipated traffic of the PD. Every dwelling unit, or other land use permitted in the PD, shall have access to a public street either directly or through an approved driveway, pedestrian way, or other means dedicated to public or private use. 
C.  Emergency access. No structure or use shall be inaccessible to emergency vehicles or as otherwise allowed as determined by fire chief. 
D.  Alleys. Alleys may be approved provided a minimum paved width of twenty (20) feet is maintained. All alleys shall conform to construction standards adopted by the City of College Park. 
E.  Pedestrian ways. Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling units, appropriate facilities within the development, and principal off-site pedestrian destinations. Walkways that are suitably located, designed and constructed may be combined with other easements and used by city emergency and service vehicles, but shall not be used by other vehicles. All pedestrian facilities shall conform to the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
F.  Intermodal circulation. The final development plan shall provide for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation within the PD. This may be accomplished through the design and construction of sidewalks and pathways, bike lanes or other means to ensure the safe and efficient movement of such alternate transportation modes as bus, shuttle, automobile, bicycle and walking. These routes shall be designed to connect to existing or future routes adjoining the PD. 
G.  Traffic management. The PD is intended to control vehicular traffic speeds and minimize conflicts between motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. Use of "traffic calming devices", such as landscaped medians, rotaries, "on street" parallel parking and defined pedestrian crosswalks must be incorporated into the proposed street system. 
4.13 - Relationship Between Planned Developments and Zoning Districts. 
A.  PDs shall be permitted throughout the city. 
B.  Except as modified by this Article and approved in a final development plan, elements in a PD shall be governed by the regulations of R-3 District with respect to single-family housing, and the MF District with respect to townhouse, condominium, and apartment development. Commercial development elements shall, unless modified by and approved in a final development plan, conform to the requirements of this Article, or where in the absence of standards in this Article, the standards of the OP District. 
C.  The final development plan for the PD may provide for such variations from district regulations established in subsection B. governing use, density, area, bulk, setbacks, parking and signs, and such subdivision regulations as may be necessary or desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed PD, provided such variations are consistent with the standards and criteria contained in this Article and have been specifically requested in the application for a PD, and further provided that no modification of the district requirements or subdivision regulations may be allowed when such proposed modification would result in any of the following conditions: 
1.  Inadequate or unsafe access to the PD; 
2.  Traffic volumes exceeding the planned capacity of the proposed major street network in the vicinity such that the level of service (LOS) falls below an LOS rating of C; 
3.  An undue burden on schools, fire and police protection, and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the PD; or 
4.  A development which will be incompatible with the purposes of the College Park Zoning Ordinance or the Comprehensive Plan.

6.21 - Especially Large Building Standards (EL). 
EL-01: This Especially Large Building Standards section applies to all zoning districts. 
A.  Applicability of this section. 
1.  This section shall apply to all new structures over thirty thousand (30,000) contiguous square feet. 
2.  This section shall apply to all nonconforming existing structures over fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet that are abandoned or left vacant for at least six (6) months. 
B.  Facades and exterior walls including sides and backs. The building shall be designed in a way that will reduce the massive scale and uniform and impersonal appearance and will provide visual interest. Long building walls exceeding one hundred (100) feet shall be broken up with projections or recessions having a minimum offset of ten (10) feet horizontal or vertical depth along all sides, and in sufficient number, to reduce the unbroken massing into lengths of approximately forty (40) feet or less along all sides of the building. Projections from the facade may be used as an alternate approach upon approval by the mayor and council. 
C.  Street frontage. Along any public street frontage the building design shall include at least one (1) of the following: Windows, arcades, awnings or other acceptable features along at least sixty (60) percent of the building length and appropriately spaced. Arcades and other weather protection features shall be of sufficient depth and height to provide a light-filled and open space along the building frontage. Architectural treatment, similar to that provided to the front facade shall be provided to the sides and rear of the building to mitigate any negative view from any location off-site and any public area (e.g. parking lots, walkways, etc.) on site. 
D.  Detail features. The building shall include architectural features that contribute to visual interest at the pedestrian scale and reduce the massive aesthetic effect by breaking up the building wall, front, side, and rear, with color, texture changes, wall offsets, reveals, or projecting ribs. 
E.  Roofs. The roof design shall provide variations in rooflines and add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roof features shall complement the architectural and visual character of adjoining neighborhoods. Roofs shall include two (2) or more roof planes. Parapet walls shall be architecturally treated to avoid a plain, monotonous look. 
F.  Materials and color. The buildings shall have exterior building materials and colors that are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors that are used in adjoining neighborhoods or as approved by the mayor and council. This includes the use of high-quality materials and colors that are low reflective, subtle, neutral, or earth tone. Certain types of colors shall be avoided, such as fluorescent or metallic, although brighter colors in limited quantities as building trims and as accents may be considered at the discretion of the planning commission. Construction materials such as tilt-up concrete, smooth-faced concrete block, prefabricated steel panels, and other similar materials shall be avoided unless the exterior surface is covered with an acceptable architectural treatment. 
G.  Entryways. The building design shall provide design elements which clearly indicate to customers where the entrances are located and which add aesthetically pleasing character to buildings by providing highly-visible customer entrances. 
H.  Screening of mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment shall be screened to mitigate noise and views in all directions. If roof-mounted, the screen shall be designed to conform architecturally to the design of the building either with varying roof planes or with parapet walls. A wood fence or similar treatment is not acceptable. If ground-mounted, the screen shall be comprised of materials identical to those of the building facade. Screening shall be by use of brick, stone or similar material where applicable. 
I.  Vehicular access. The use shall provide safety and protection to adjacent residential uses by having motor vehicles access only from an arterial, major or business district road as designated in the master plan. 
J.  Buffers. The use shall provide visual and noise buffers to nearby residential uses. This can be accomplished by providing a substantial building setback from a residential use or residentially zoned property that is adjacent to the site. A landscape buffer of substantial width shall be provided adjacent to the site property line where it adjoins residential uses or zones. The landscape buffer shall include canopy trees at regular intervals to provide noise, light, and visual screening. No other uses are permitted within the landscape buffer area. 
K.  Outdoor sales and storage. Areas for outdoor sales of products may be permitted if they are extensions of the sales floor into which patrons are allowed free access. Such areas shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping and shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences. Materials, colors and design of screening walls and/or fences shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the building. Chain link fencing is prohibited. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall be similar in materials and colors to those that are predominantly used on the building facade. Outdoor sales areas shall be considered as part of the gross floor area of the retail establishment. Outdoor storage of products in an area where customers are not permitted is prohibited. This prohibition includes outdoor storage sheds and containers. Any outdoor sales and storage shall comply with all other city ordinances. 
L.  Noise mitigation. The project shall make every reasonable attempt to mitigate noise and visual impacts on adjoining residential neighborhoods and streets from trash collection areas by location of these areas on-site and at least fifty (50) feet from any residential use, residentially zoned property, or street that is adjacent to the site, unless such operations are located entirely within an enclosed building or underground. 
M.  Trash collection areas. All trash collection areas that are not within an enclosed building or underground must be screened or recessed so that they are not visible from public streets, public sidewalks, internal pedestrian walkways or adjacent residential properties. Screening and landscaping of these areas shall conform to the predominant materials used on the site. 
N.  Parking lots and structures. 
1.  Parking areas must provide safe, convenient and efficient access. They must be distributed around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks, and to reduce the overall area of the paved surface. Landscaping shall be used to define parking areas, primary vehicular drives and pedestrian areas in an aesthetically and environmentally pleasing manner. Lighting shall be approved by the mayor and council. 
2.  Parking structure facades shall achieve the same high quality design and appearance as the buildings they serve. The parking structure's utilitarian appearance shall be minimized by utilizing effective design treatments such as colonnades, arcades, awnings, street furniture, brick or stone facade and other public amenities. Compatible materials, coordinated landscaping and screening, appropriate building color, pedestrian sensitive lighting and signage shall all be considered for garage facades. Surface parking shall be screened with landscaping. 
O.  Pedestrian flows. The project shall provide pedestrian accessibility, safety, and convenience to reduce traffic impacts and enable the development to project a friendly inviting image. Continuous internal pedestrian walkways no less than eight (8) feet in width shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. Sidewalks shall also connect the store entrances to transit stops on or off-site and to nearby neighborhoods. Sidewalks shall be provided along the full length of any building where it adjoins a parking lot. 
P.  Central features and community spaces. The project is to provide attractive and inviting pedestrian scale features, spaces and amenities. Entrances and parking lot locations shall be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. Bus stops shall be considered internal parts of the configuration whether they are located on-site or along the street. Customer drop-off/pick-up points that may be provided shall also be integrated into the design and shall not conflict with traffic lanes or pedestrian paths. Special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, light fixtures, planter walls, seating areas, and other architectural features that define circulation paths and outdoor spaces shall anchor pedestrian ways. Examples are outdoor plazas, patios, courtyards, and window shopping areas. Each development shall have at least two (2) of these areas. 
Q.  Delivery and loading spaces. Delivery and loading operations shall be designed and located to mitigate visual and noise impacts to adjoining neighborhoods. If there is a residential use or residentially zoned area adjacent to the site, such operations shall not be permitted between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the following day. For good cause shown, the planning commission may permit deliveries at additional times provided the applicant submits evidence that sound barriers between all areas for such operations effectively reduce noise emissions to a level of fifty-five (55) Db or less as measured at the lot line of any adjoining residential property. Delivery and loading areas shall be set back from a residential use or residentially zoned property that is adjacent to that site. A landscape buffer of substantial width shall be provided adjacent to the delivery and loading area where it adjoins residential uses or zones. The landscape buffer shall include evergreen shrubs and/or trees plus deciduous canopy trees at regular intervals to provide noise, light, and visual screening. If the delivery and loading spaces are located within an enclosed building or underground, no such setback and buffer area shall be required. 
Delivery trucks shall not be parked in close proximity to or within a designated delivery or loading area during non-delivery hours with motor and/or refrigerators/generators running, unless the area where the trucks are parked is set back at least fifty (50) feet from residential property to mitigate the truck noise. Any engine motor idling shall not exceed five (5) minutes. 
The delivery and loading areas shall be screened or enclosed so that they are not visible from public streets, public sidewalks, internal pedestrian walkways or adjacent properties. The screen shall be of masonry construction and at least ten (10) feet high, measured from the loading dock floor elevation, to screen the noise and activity at the loading dock. 
R.  Traffic impacts. The applicant shall have a traffic impact study prepared according to the Institute of Transportation Engineering (ITE) latest version. In addition to the general standards of the ITE, the traffic impact study shall include weekend traffic generation and impact analysis. The traffic impact study shall also study all of the nearest intersections to the site, or any area designated by the Engineering Director, to take into account the regional traffic draw a large-scale establishment. 
S.  Outdoor lighting. The applicant must provide an outdoor lighting report, which provides information on how outdoor lighting will be accomplished to minimize impacts on adjacent properties or roadways. Outdoor lighting shall provide security, with a minimum illumination of two and four-tenths (2.4) foot-candles of light measured at grade level. This can be accomplished by aiming the lights downward and fitting lights with hoods. The light element shall not protrude below the lower edge of the hood. To minimize any indirect overflow of light on adjacent residential properties, the height of any proposed parking lot light standard shall be as short as possible and shall stair step down to a lower height when close to residential uses or residentially used properties. Lighting standards shall apply as approved by the mayor and council. 
T.  Ancillary uses. The applicant must demonstrate that any ancillary uses such as tire shops or snack bars will not have negative impacts on adjacent residential uses, residentially zoned properties, or adjacent properties. Any ancillary use must be oriented to face away from any residential use or residentially zoned property that is adjacent to the site. 
U.  Noise abatement. A noise mitigation plan must be provided to the Chief Building Inspector that indicates how the noise initiated by the land use will be mitigated to comply with noise regulations applicable in the City of College Park. 
V.  Landscaping. Each parking area shall be surrounded by a twenty-foot wide landscaped area around its edge. Shade and ornamental trees are also required in the parking areas, with the amount and placement to be determined through consultation with the City Planner at the time of site plan review. If a lot is located adjacent to an area used for residences or a residentially zoned area, the front of the site must be landscaped with berms, hedges, and/or walls of at least four (4) feet in height to screen parking lots from the street. 
W.  Demolition security. It shall be unlawful to begin work on construction of any structure regulated by this section until the city is provided with a performance bond payable to the city issued by an appropriately licensed surety or other sufficient security in a form approved by the city attorney and reasonably acceptable to the city in the amount of one hundred and ten (110) percent of the estimated cost of demolition of the structure, including cleanup of all materials and rubbish and including landscaping to include, at a minimum, grassing of all unpaved areas. The aforementioned estimated cost shall be equal to the average of three (3) separate written estimates by businesses reasonably acceptable by the city, copies of which estimates shall be provided to the city simultaneously with the required security. 
1.  In the event that at least seventy (70) percent of the floor area of the structure is not occupied by goods, including displays, and/or areas devoted to the provision of services including, but not limited to auto maintenance, eye examinations and financial services, or in the event that at least seventy (70) percent of the floor area of the structure is not open to the public, for a period of more than six (6) months, the city may provide written notice to the owner of the property and any tenant of such situation. 
2.  The owner or any tenant shall have until one (1) month after the date of the written notice provided for in paragraph 1. above either to remedy the situation or to reply in writing with a timetable either for remedying the situation, any such remedy to be completed within three (3) months of the date of the reply, or for demolition of the structure, such demolition to begin within one (1) month of the date of the reply. 
3.  In the event the owner or any tenant fails to remedy the situation described in paragraph 1. above within one (1) month of notice from the city if no reply is provided to the city, or within three (3) months of providing a notice to the city of intent to remedy pursuant to paragraph 2., the city shall send written notice of such failure to the owner or any tenant, and the owner or any tenant shall begin demolition of the structure within one (1) month of the date of such notice of failure from the city. 
4.  Demolition of any structure shall include cleanup of all materials and rubbish and shall include landscaping, at a minimum to include grassing of all unpaved areas, within one (1) month of the initiation of the demolition. 
5.  In the event that demolition of a structure is required by this subsection and the owner or any tenant fails to complete all or any portion of said demolition within the time provided herein, the city may utilize the bond provided for in subsection W.1. above to pay for such demolition or any part thereof. 
X.  Floor Area. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "floor area" shall mean the square footage of the footprint of the structure located inside the exterior walls of the structure, excluding areas devoted exclusively to aisles or other open spaces reasonably necessary to allow the flow of customers within the structure, and also excluding any areas, not to exceed fifty (50) percent of the square footage of the footprint of the structure located inside the exterior walls, devoted exclusively to storage of inventory and not normally accessible to customers.

ARTICLE 7. - TELECOMMUNICATION STANDARDS 

7.1 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Article is to establish guidelines and regulations for the siting of all wireless, cellular, television, and radio telecommunications facilities, including all equipment and network components, exclusive of any underlying support structure, such as antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling, accessory equipment, or other mechanisms used to provide and or aid the transmission of wireless data, cellular, television, radio, or other telecommunications services. The Mayor and Council recognize that the city is to provide for the siting of telecommunication facilities, support structures, and antennas pursuant to the mandates of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While mandated to make such provisions, the Mayor and Council also recognize that telecommunications facilities, such as towers and monopoles, telecommunication support structures, and antennas may negatively impact the aesthetic appearance of the city, and may reduce the property value of lots proximately located to such telecommunication support structures, particularly when they are sited adjacent to residential areas. 
    The goals of this Article, therefore, are: 
1.  To encourage the location of telecommunications facilities, including all Telecommunication Support Structures, Equipment, and/or Antenna(s) in nonresidential areas; 
2.  To promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by regulating the sitting of and establishing development standards for wireless facilities and related wireless support structures, equipment, and infrastructure; 
3.  To minimize the total number of telecommunication support structures within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of College Park; 
4.  To encourage the joint use of new and existing telecommunication support structure sites among service providers; 
5.  To locate telecommunication facilities and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized; 
6.  To encourage the design and construction of telecommunication facilities and antennas in a manner that minimizes adverse visual impacts; 
7.  To follow and promote policies embodied in Section 704 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and O.C.G.A. § 36-66B-1, et al., in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent wireless services or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services in the city; 
8.  To encourage the location of telecommunication support structures on municipal property; and 
9.  To enhance the ability of the providers of wireless telecommunications services to deliver such services to the community effectively, efficiently and safely.

Each Applicant shall, upon receiving authorization from the Department to erect or modify telecommunication facilities in a public right-of-way, and to the greatest extent permitted by law, expressly undertake to defend, indemnify, and hold the city and its officers, appointed officials, agents, employees, and assigns harmless from and against any and all damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless, or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act, or misconduct of the Applicant or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, or removal of any telecommunication facilities in public rights-of-way, whether such acts are authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this Article. 
6.  Transfer of Authorization to Erect, Own, and Operate Telecommunication Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way. Control of an authorized telecommunication facility in a public right-of-way may not, directly or indirectly, be transferred, assigned, or disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation or other act of a Grantee, by operation of law or otherwise, without prior consent of the Department, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. A Grantee and the proposed assignee or transferee of an existing permit to erect and operate a telecommunication facility in a public right-of-way shall provide and certify, via sworn affidavit, the following information to the Department not less than ninety (90) days prior to the proposed date of such transfer or assignment of control: 
a.  Information setting forth the nature, terms, and conditions of the proposed transfer or assignment of ownership and/or control; 
b.  With respect to the transferee/assignee, all information as outlined in Section 20(b) [Subsection T.] of this Article; 
c.  Any changes to information provided to the Department, as set forth in Section 20(b)(3) [Subsection T.] of this Article; and 
d.  Any other information reasonably required by the Department. 
T.  Limitations of Municipal Authority. In regulating the erection and maintenance of telecommunication facilities, whether located on private lands or in public rights-of-way, the Department shall not: 
1.  Condition the approval of any application for a new telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure on a requirement that a modification or co-location to such structure be subject to a review inconsistent with this Article; 
2.  Require the removal of an existing telecommunication support structure, alternative telecommunication support structure, or telecommunication facility as a condition of approval of an application for a new telecommunication facility unless such existing telecommunication support structure, alternative telecommunication support structure, or telecommunication facility is abandoned and owned by the Applicant; 
3.  Require the Applicant to place an antenna or other equipment on publicly owned land or on a publicly or privately owned water tank, building, or electric transmission tower as an alternative to the location proposed by the Applicant. 
U.  Fees. The fees levied and charged for all persons and businesses subject thereto shall be set forth on a schedule which may be amended from time to time by resolution of the Mayor and Council, a copy of which shall be maintained on file in the City Clerk's office and in the Department. Said fees are levied and assessed in addition to any business or occupational taxes assessed and levied under the Code of Ordinances. For applications seeking to modify an existing telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure or seeking to co-locate equipment onto an existing telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure, not resulting in a substantial increase in size as governed by this Article, the Department shall not impose a fee greater than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for review and inspection, unless otherwise permitted by law. Applications for small cell installations, whether co-location or erection of new infrastructure, shall not be charged more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for up to the first five locations requested concurrently, one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each additional location therefrom. The Department shall not seek reimbursement from an Applicant for fees, consultation fees, registry fees, audit fees, or otherwise payment in connection with an application subject to this Article on a contingency fee arrangement. 
V.  Bond Requirement for New Telecommunication Support Structures. Prior to the issuance of a permit for the erection of a telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure, an Applicant shall procure a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount not less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) conditioned upon the removal of the telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure, should it be deemed abandoned under the provisions set forth in section 4 of this Article. Such bond or letter of credit (a) shall be renewed at least every two (2) years during the life of the telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure, (b) shall not expire unless the Department is given sixty (60) calendar days' prior written notice, (c) shall include the name, address, telephone number, and contact for the provider bond or letter of credit and (d) in the case of a bond, shall include a statement that the provider of the bond is listed in the latest issue of the U.S. Treasury Circular 570. 
W.  Non-Discrimination. In evaluating any application governed by this Article, the Department shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and technical capabilities and/or deny an application based solely on the financial status of an Applicant, type of telecommunication services to be provided should a prospective application be approved, and/or the content of telecommunications to be provided by and/or through proposed telecommunication facilities. 
X.  Zoning Standards. Applicants seeking to erect new telecommunication support structures, alternative telecommunication support structures, and telecommunication facilities that result in a substantial increase in size of an existing telecommunication facility that adequately demonstrate that antenna co-location, as required in section 9 of this Article, is not possible for a given geographic search area, shall construct any such new telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure, including the placement of a service building or other supporting equipment used in connection with said telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure, in the following zoning districts (provided, however, that all structures shall meet the setback, screening and buffer requirements contained herein) subject to the following: 
1.  No permit to construct a telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure shall be issued unless the location has been zoned "C-2" Central Business District, "M-1" Light Industrial District or "M-2" Heavy Industrial District under the zoning laws of the city. This limitation shall not apply to the erection of telecommunication support structures or alternative telecommunication support structures for small cell installations. 
2.  No permit to construct a telecommunication support structure or alternative telecommunication support structure shall be issued for any proposed facility in excess of one hundred fifty (150) feet in height. 
Y.  Inspections. 
1.  Whenever inspections of the premises used for or in connection with a telecommunication support structure, alternative telecommunication support structure, or antenna are provided for or required by ordinance, or are reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with any ordinance provision or to detect violations thereof, it shall be the duty of the Applicant, or the person(s) responsible for the premises to be inspected, to admit thereto for the purpose of making the inspection any officer, agent, or employee of the city who is authorized or directed to make such inspection, at any reasonable time that admission is requested. 
2.  In addition to any other penalty which may be provided, the permit granted to any Applicant who refuses to allow any authorized officer, agent or employee of the city to make any inspection provided for in subsection (a) hereinabove, or who interferes with such officer or employee while in the performance of his duty in making such inspection may be suspended or revoked at the discretion of the Department. 
Z.  Penalties for violation. In addition to the other remedies available to the city for violation of this Section set forth herein or in any other applicable provision of the Code of Ordinances, the municipal court of the city, after notice to the Applicant or permittee and hearing, may impose a civil fine for failure to comply with the provisions of this Section or a sentence not to exceed sixty (60) days. Such a civil fine shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day and may be enforced by the contempt power of the court. In addition the Applicant or permittee shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

(Ord. No. 2019-02, § 1, 2-18-19) 
ARTICLE 8. - TREE PRESERVATION 

8.1 - Intent. 
    It is the expressed intent of these tree protection standards that all site planning and design for development of land be undertaken with a survey of trees on the property and that the grading, final placement of buildings, structures, and roads, utilities, and other features minimizes the removal of existing trees, and insures their aesthetic distribution throughout the development on the property. 
    In support and furtherance of its findings and determination that: 
1.  Rampant growth and development in the region has resulted in the innumerable loss of trees. Tree roots hold soil in place and tree photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide to oxygen. Tree loss thus has contributed to dramatically increased soil erosion and sedimentation. High growth areas, where natural green spaces are diminishing, have left fewer trees to transform into oxygen the carbon dioxide of ever increasing, harmful vehicular and industrial emissions, resulting in severe air quality degradation; 
2.  Integrated forest canopies reduce the costs of maintenance of other co-located parts of the urban infrastructure; 
3.  Well managed urban forest resources increase in value and provide benefits to all citizens of the community with respect to air quality, water quality, stormwater management, temperature amelioration, community aesthetics and general quality of life; 
4.  These benefits are crucial to the long term health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of College Park; 
5.  The removal of forest canopy from urban areas of the state and its replacement with more intensive land uses exacts real costs upon the infrastructure which must be borne by all citizens of the community; 
6.  Community forests function to the benefit of the local citizenry as a part of the public infrastructure as much as streets, utilities, stormwater management structures and sewers; 
7.  Healthy community forests increase local commercial and residential property values; and 
8.  A tree conservation and landscaping ordinance is one part of a dedicated and integrated planning process dealing with land use, impacts of impervious surface, urban hydrology and water quality. 
8.2 - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply to any and all activity within the City of College Park (city) which requires a land-disturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit. Exemptions from this Article are: 
1.  Removal of dead, diseased, or infested trees, as determined by the Georgia Forestry Commission. Proof of a certified arborist's determination is required, in order to avoid penalties for tree removal. 
2.  The operation and maintenance of orchards and tree nurseries in active commercial operation. 
3.  All property involved in a viable agricultural operation (establishment, cultivation, or harvesting of fields, and/or livestock operation). Commercial forestry operations are allowed, provided that valid forestry management plans have been submitted to, and accepted by the City of College Park. 
4.  Any lot within a subdivision zoned for single family residential uses where the lot has been purchased from the developer and a house has been built. 
8.3 - Specimen Trees. 
    A specimen tree is any tree or grouping of trees which has been determined to be of high value because of its species, size, age, location, or historic value. General criteria for the determination of specimen trees are as follows: 
1.  Any deciduous canopy tree who's DBH equals or exceeds twenty-six (26) inches. 
2.  Any evergreen canopy tree who's DBH equals or exceeds twenty-two (22) inches. 
3.  Any understory tree who's DBH equals or exceeds eight (8) inches. 
4.  Any dogwood, redbud or magnolia tree who's DBH equals or exceeds four (4) inches. 
5.  Any tree which has a significant historical value and can be documented through historical records, or otherwise. 
8.4 - Protected Trees. 
1.  No person shall cut, destroy, cause to be destroyed or remove any tree of eight (8) inches Diameter Breast Height (DBH) (twenty-five-inch circumference) or larger or any dogwood, redbud or magnolia tree with a trunk diameter of four (4) inches DBH or larger in preparation for, anticipation of, or in conjunction with any development activity until such removal has been approved as part of the overall site development approval process of this Article. The saving of existing trees less than the protected size is encouraged and may be utilized in some cases to meet the requirements for replacement of trees that are approved for removal. 
2.  Deforestation on non-exempt properties is strictly prohibited. Any person, or entity who is responsible for the deforestation of a site shall be subject to the maximum penalties allowed under this Article. Additionally, any site, which includes exempt and non-exempt properties, that has been deforested shall not be eligible to apply for a development permit, a building permit, rezoning, or annexation into the city for a period of thirty-six (36) months from the date that the deforestation occurred. For purposes of this paragraph the last date of deforestation shall be the last day in which a forestry operation is conducted. The property owner who conducts a forestry operation within the city shall be required, within thirty (30) days of the last day of deforestation, to deliver to the city manager a written notice setting forth the last date of deforestation and the identity and location of the property deforested. Upon a property owner failing to timely notify the city manager as provided above, the Engineering Director shall establish the last day of deforestation based upon the best information available to him/her, which estimated date shall not be rebutable. For purposes hereof forestry operation shall include, but is not limited to, the harvesting of forty (40) percent or more of the trees measuring eight (8) inches dbh and larger on any property or development site. For purposes of this paragraph, the term site shall encompass and include any and all property within the city without regard to any possible exemption. 
3.  The sites of trees that have been identified to be saved on a tree protection plan (see below) and are subsequently removed, must be replaced with an equal number of replacement TDU's. 
8.5 - Tree Protection Plan (TPP) Required. 
    A tree protection plan (TPP) must be submitted to the Engineering Director Chief Building Inspector upon application for a land-disturbance permit. The TPP shall be combined with a preliminary plat, construction plans and/or site plans whenever possible. The TPP must be prepared by one (1) or more of the following professional, registered in the State of Georgia: registered landscape architect, urban forester, arborist, land surveyor, or engineer. The TPP must include: 
1.  The location of all trees with a trunk diameter of eight (8) inches DBH and larger and all dogwoods, redbuds, and magnolias with a trunk diameter of four (4) inches DBH and larger. For sites over ten (10) acres in size, representative sample areas proposed by the owner's licensed engineers may be used to determine tree density. The sample areas shall be representative of the average total tree coverage of the site. When city staff questions the sample's fair representation of average total tree coverage, the city manager after consultation with the city's engineers shall determine the sample areas to be used. 
2.  The species, location, DBH, and Critical Root Zone (CRZ) of all existing trees and specimen trees which will be retained to fulfill density requirements. Five (5) or more trees whose CRZ combine into one (1) tree protection area may be outlined as a group, with their size and species listed in a summary table. 
3.  The species, location and DBH of all trees proposed to be removed. The Engineering Director may require additional information including, but not limited to, a certified arborist's appraisal of the trees viability and anticipated life span. A specimen tree may be removed if it is shown that at least one (1) of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The location of the tree prevents the opening of necessary traffic lanes. 
b.  The location of the tree prevents access to the property, and that no alternative access exists. 
c.  The tree is dead, diseased, or dying to the point that repair or restoration is not practical, or the disease may be transmitted to other trees, as determined by a certified arborist, the City Planner, or his/her designee, or Georgia Forestry Commission. 
d.  The construction of utility lines necessary for the project cannot be installed via directional boring. 
i.  The boundaries of all required buffer areas. 
ii.  The boundaries of all landscaped areas. 
iii.  The boundaries of all proposed buildings. 
iv.  The boundaries of all other impervious surfaces. 
v.  The location, depth and height of all utilities. 
4.  Upon submission of the TPP to the Engineering Director, a preliminary review will be made by the Engineering Director, or his/her designee. The TPP will either be approved, denied, or returned to the applicant with recommended changes, which must be made prior to the issuance of a land-disturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit. 
8.6 - Site Design. 
    All MF, OP, C1, C2, HC, BP, LI and HI properties must maintain forty (40) percent of the site as green space. 
    All DC, and DO properties must maintain twenty-five (25) percent of the site as green space. 
    While all types of trees are protected under these standards, special emphasis is placed on preservation of large trees and certain significant and more valued species listed herein. The highest site design priority shall be given to preservation of hardwood trees with a DBH of twenty-six (26) inches or larger. Removal of these valued trees is highly discouraged, and will only be approved upon the determination of the planning and zoning commission that all responsible design alternatives have been explored by the applicant and removal cannot be avoided. 
    The placement of grade changes and building pads shall respect existing significant trees. Under no circumstance shall a grade change be allowed to intrude upon the CRZ of a retained tree. For development sites that do not contain any or very few of these significant trees, design emphasis should be shifted to preserving other species present. 
8.7 - Tree and Shrub Density Requirements. 
1.  Property subject to this Article shall have, as a condition of approval, a minimum average tree density of fifty (50) Tree Density Units (TDUs) per acre of disturbed area. Disturbed area is defined as the entire limits of the site project activity (buildings, roads, parking areas, stormwater management systems, etc.) outside of the buffer area. Existing trees, which will be retained, will be given credit toward this requirement at the rate of one (1) TDU per caliper inch DBH. Replacement trees will be given credit toward this requirement using a trunk measurement which is no less than six (6) inches from the ground, at rate of one (1) TDU per two (2) inches of trunk diameter. Replacement trees from two-inch caliper up to three-inch caliper are worth fifty (50) percent of the TDUs for an existing tree. Replacement trees from three-inch caliper to four-inch caliper are equal to the TDUs of an existing tree. Replacement trees four-inch caliper and over are worth one hundred fifty (150) percent of the TDUs for an existing tree. Under no circumstances will the density be less than fifty (50) or greater than one hundred (100) TDUs per acre of disturbed area. Tree density units per disturbed acre are in addition to any natural, undisturbed, watershed protection buffers or other environmental buffers required for development. 
2.  Single Family Residential lots being developed, shall have proportional share of fifty (50) TDUs per acre, post development, or portion thereof, with a minimum of one (1) overstory tree per dwelling unit (DU), located adjacent to the right-of-way, and spaced eighty (80) to one hundred (100) feet apart. Example: 
One (1) acre lots shall have fifty (50) TDUs; 
Half (1/2) acre lots shall have twenty-five (25) TDUs; 
One-quarter (1/4) acre lots shall have 12.5 TDUs; 
Less than one-quarter (1/4) acre lots shall have TDUs at the same proportions as above. 
8.8 - Shrub Density Requirements. 
1.  Property subject to this Article shall have, as a condition of approval, a minimum average shrub density of one hundred (100) SDUs per acre. All SDUs to be planted must be located outside any natural occurring vegetation. 
2.  In order to encourage the protection of trees above and beyond the required 50 TDUs, shrub density requirements may be reduced by a similar area covered by the CRZ of the additional trees to be saved. 
3.  As a healthy shrub eventually covers an area with a five-foot diameter, or 19.6 square feet, the required SDUs may be reduced by that area equal to 19.6 square feet, or multiples thereof. For example, should a development save sixty (60) caliper inches of existing tree stock, per acre, the applicant would receive credit for the additional ten (10) inches. This could be calculated as follows: 
a.  Determine the critical root zone (CRZ) of the tree to be saved (a ten-inch tree would yield a fifteen-foot wide CRZ. 
b.  Square the CRZ (two hundred twenty-five (225) square feet). 
c.  Multiply the product of Step 2 by 3.14 (p). This determines the healthy growing area of the tree to be saved, or 706.5 square feet. 
d.  Divide the result of Step 3 by 19.6 = 36 SDUs. 
e.  The number derived in Step 4 is the allowable reduction in SDUs. 
8.9 - Highway Buffer. 
1.  A landscaped highway buffer shall be established parallel to the entire front of the property along Roosevelt Highway outside of Downtown College Park, on Old National Highway, on Godby Road, and on W. Fayetteville Road. The highway buffer is included in the fifty (50) TDU and one hundred (100) SDU per acre requirements. 
2.  For existing lots of record with a total depth from the right-of-way lines less than five hundred (500) feet, the depth of the highway buffer will be measured at ten (10) percent of the depth of the lot. For each fifty-foot decrease from the five hundred-foot measure, landscaping will be required according to the following table per every one hundred (100) feet of lot width: 
Depth of Lot (Linear Feet) Buffer Depth (Linear Feet) TDUs required per 100 linear feet SDUs required per 100 linear feet Area of Buffer (Square Feet) 500 50 13 15 50,000 450 45 13 15 45,000 400 40 12 14 40,000 350 35 11 13 35,000 300 30 10 12 30,000 250 25 9 11 25,000  
3.  For lots that measure between the fifty-foot increments, the number closest to the lot depth shall apply (i.e., a depth measuring two hundred eighty-five (285) feet would be required to plant additional vegetation. 
4.  If an existing lot measures less than two hundred fifty (250) feet in depth, the minimum depth of the highway buffer shall be twenty-five (25) feet. 
5.  This sliding scale provision for the highway buffer does not apply to any lot with a depth greater than five hundred (500) feet, which would be required to provide for the fifty-foot buffer. 
6.  If due to site constraints and location of existing vegetation, the number of total required landscaping materials cannot be reasonably placed within the highway buffer, the individual plant materials are still required but may be placed elsewhere along the side buffers, rear buffer or within the parking medians. The planning and zoning commission shall have discretion over the alternate placing of materials. 
7.  The buffer shall contain only vegetative landscaping materials, except for the uses listed below: 
a.  Vehicular access drives placed approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way; 
b.  Foot and bicycle paths; 
c.  Walls and fences less than six (6) feet in height; 
d.  Landscaping sculpture, lighting fixtures, trellises and arbors; 
e.  Signage; 
f.  Water, sanitary sewer, electrical, telephone, natural gas, cable and other service lines provided that they are placed approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way. Where existing lines or planned lines must run parallel to the right-of-way, an equivalent amount of buffer may be required beyond the fifty (50) feet if the character of the buffer is greatly disturbed. To the extent possible, such service lines should be consolidated with vehicular access routes. 
g.  Electrical, telephone, gas, water supply, sewage disposal and other utilities may be constructed within the required buffer area. After installation of such services and to meet the requirements of this section, the developer shall be required to restore the buffer area as approved by the city. 
h.  Drainage and stormwater detention areas. Where existing or created ponds and drainage swales will occupy a substantial portion of the highway buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patters, additional buffer depth may be required to achieve the visual softening intent of this section. 
8.  No tree six (6) inches in diameter at four (4) feet dbh (diameter breast height) or larger may be removed from the highway buffer except for access drives, sight triangles, and dead or diseased trees as approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
9.  Landscaping. The purpose of this section is to protect and enhance any existing tree canopy, understory trees and shrubbery coverage in order to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots visible from the highway. It is also the purpose of this section to screen headlight glare on and off site and to mitigate commercial lighting as seen by neighboring properties and from the highway. Natural appearing landscape forms are encouraged. 
a.  The plant materials designated in this Article shall be generally distributed along and throughout the buffer in order that there not be significant gaps without plantings (except as required at sight triangles and road intersections). 
b.  No more than one (1) in three (3) overstory trees shall be pine or cone-bearing. 
c.  Existing, as well as installed, vegetation may be included in meeting the requirement, but if there is not sufficient distribution within the buffer, then additional plantings will be required at the discretion of the planning and zoning commission. 
d.  Existing evergreen or deciduous understory trees may be counted for credit to meet the requirements. 
e.  Size, caliper, and height of trees, shrubs or plants shall meet requirements of city's general landscape ordinance. 
f.  Trees and shrubs shall not be pruned in any manner that would significantly diminish the desired softening character of the buffer except in accordance with standard horticultural practice. Trees shall not be limbed-up from the ground more than six (6) feet to the lowest branches, except as required within sight triangles at intersections or to provide adequate light for understory plantings. 
8.10 - Other Buffer and Landscaping Standards. 
A.  Perimeter buffers. Landscaped buffers at least ten (10) feet in width shall be maintained along the side and rear property boundaries. These buffers may be penetrated for vehicular and pedestrian passageways linking adjoining properties provided the passageways are placed approximately perpendicular to these buffers. 
B.  Foundation buffers. A landscaped buffer at least six (6) feet wide shall be maintained between any structure and any parking or driving area, except for loading areas and areas where drive-through facilities are utilized. This space is to be reserved for plant material, either existing or planned. Sidewalks and handicap ramps may be placed adjacent to the buffer on either side. The buffer may be penetrated to provide for access to the building. 
C.  Opaque walls and fences. Any opaque or partially opaque walls or fences installed along the front of the property, including those used for screening of parking areas, must be softened with landscaping materials. 
D.  Parking lot requirements. Parking lots shall include landscaped strips and landscaped islands as follows. 
E.  Landscaped strip. Shrubs and/or trees shall be installed in the landscaped strip to provide for semi-continuous planting along the landscaped strip. Shrubs shall be at least one (1) foot in height at installation and reasonably projected to grow at least two (2) feet in height within three (3) years. 
F.  Landscaped island. Each landscaped island shall contain one (1) broad-leaved overstory tree with a minimum size of two (2) caliper inches at dbh and a minimum height of ten (10) feet. 
8.11 - Tree Protection Requirements. 
    Tree protection best management practices (BMPs) will be mandatory to insure the survival of existing trees and stands of trees during and after construction. Sometimes, it is more feasible to save stands of trees than it is to save single trees which are scattered throughout a site. A tree protection area shall be maintained around all trees and stands of trees to be retained. In most cases, this tree protection area is the same as the critical root zone (CRZ). In some instances, a larger area may have to be designated as a tree protection area as determined by the Georgia Forestry Commission, or the Engineering Director. The tree protection area shall be marked with standard tree protection fencing (orange) as well as with "Tree Protection Area" signs attached to the tree protection fencing stakes. 
    The construction and grading process can cause damages such as direct physical root damage, indirect root damage, and trunk/crown damage. Due to this, no land-disturbance, construction process, or storage of equipment or materials will be allowed to take place within the tree protection area, and the following will be adhered to: 
1.  All individual trees to be retained must be marked with orange engineering tape tied around the trunk of the tree at a height of five (5) feet above the pre-development grade. 
2.  The tree protection area (CRZ) of individual trees and stands of trees will be marked with standard tree protection fencing (orange). At least two (2) "Tree Protection Area" signs (two (2) square feet each) shall be posted at each individual tree protection area. At least four (4) "Tree Protection Area" signs shall be posted at stand of trees to be protected. Signs shall not be nailed or affixed to trees, but shall be attached to stakes supporting the tree protection fencing. 
3.  No person engaged in the construction of any structure(s) or improvement(s) or any activity shall encroach or place solvents, material, construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six (6) feet of the area outside the critical root zone as defined herein, or any existing significant tree within a tree save area or buffer zone. 
4.  During subdivision street construction, land-disturbance allowed by a development permit, shall be limited to areas needed for street right-of-way, drainage easements, and utilities. All other areas will be considered tree protection areas. If utilities must be routed through a tree protection area, and as a result, encroach upon the CRZ of any tree to be saved, the utility must be tunneled (by directional bore technique) at a minimum depth of twenty-four (24) inches. 
5.  The tree protection area should be maintained in a naturally vegetated state. The clearing of invasive non-native plant materials, such as kudzu, shall be allowed. 
6.  Structures shall not be located closer to a specimen tree than the distance equal to the CRZ. 
7.  Roads and paved areas shall not be located closer to a specimen tree than the distance equal to the CRZ plus ten (10) feet, without consent of the city. 
8.  If irreparable damage has occurred to a tree or trees within a tree protection area, as determined by the Engineering Director, or the Georgia Forestry Commission, it shall be the responsibility of the developer/builder to remove and replace tree or trees with an equal number of replacement TDU's as the damaged tree(s), and to guarantee survival of the tree or trees, after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
8.12 - Tree Replacement Requirements. 
    In some cases, tree replacement will be necessary to fulfill the tree density requirement. The following are guidelines for tree replacement to be followed after the construction process: 
1.  All trees selected for replacement must be quality specimens free of disease, injury, or infestation, and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing area, and planted in accordance with standards established by the International Society of Arboriculture. 
2.  All new trees planted to fulfill the tree density requirements must be in place prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
3.  New trees planted under the requirements of this Article which do not survive for twenty-four (24) months after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, will be replaced as a condition of occupancy. Trees shall be bonded via a maintenance agreement. Bonds will be released after the twenty-four-month period has passed, and the health of the trees has been certified and accepted by the city. 
4.  Replacement overstory trees shall not be planted within twenty (20) feet of any structure, or within ten (10) feet of any paved area. Replacement understory trees shall not be planted within ten (10) feet of any structure, or within five (5) feet of any paved area. 
5.  Landscape islands and peninsulas in non-residential and institutional parking areas must contain sufficient pervious surface area to accommodate the appropriate replacement tree, in order to insure its longevity, and shall be irrigated. 
6.  At least seventy-five (75) percent of the replacement trees must be native trees as indicated in the list of suitable replacement trees. 
7.  The minimum diameter for replacement trees shall be two (2) inches as measured six (6) inches above grade. 
8.  Vegetation shall be at least five (5) feet from fire hydrants, and shall be maintained as such. 
9.  Residential lots shall have proportional share of TDUs per acre, or portion thereof, with a minimum of one (1) overstory tree per dwelling unit (DU), located adjacent to the right-of-way, and spaced eighty (80) to one hundred (100) feet apart. 
10.  In order to prevent a mono-crop urban forest, which can be prone to disease, no more than fifty (50) percent of the replacement trees may be of one (1) species. The remaining replacement tree stock must be made up of two (2) additional species. 
11.  Where minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints, or redevelopment status, and not site design or size of the property, the developer/builder may seek permission from the (city manager or designee? City planner? Other?) to donate to the City of College Park landscaping and reforestation fund to compensate for not meeting the requirements of the landscaping ordinance.

8.14 - Compliance and Enforcement. 
    It is the responsibility of the Engineering Director Chief Building Inspector, or his/her designees to review the TPP to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Article before a land-disturbance or soil erosion and sediment control permit will be issued. It is the responsibility of the Engineering Director Chief Building Inspector, or his/her designees to conduct a final inspection for compliance with this section before a certificate of occupancy will be granted. The Engineering Director Chief Building Inspector, or his/her designees have the authority to revoke, suspend, or void any land-disturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit, stop all work on-site or any portion thereof, or withhold a certificate of occupancy when there has been a violation of any of the provisions of this Article. 
8.15 - Bonding. 
    In order to insure the survival of required replacement trees and shrubs, said plant materials may, at the discretion of the City Planner, be bonded under the following circumstances: 
1.  Seasonal planting bond. When the time of year is inappropriate for installation of required plant materials, a seasonal planting bond may be utilized for a period of up to six (6) months. This bond allows a project to receive a certificate of occupancy once all other requirements have been met. The seasonal planting bond shall be equal to one hundred (100) percent of the total cost of materials and installation, and will be released upon final inspection and compliance with the approved landscaping plan. Seasonal planting bonds shall be in the form of cash, check, money order, or letter of credit. 
2.  Landscape survival bond. All projects that require replacement plant materials shall be required to submit a landscape survival bond, which shall be valid for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of the certificate of occupancy. This bond allows for the replacement of plant materials that fail within the twenty-four-month period. The landscape survival bond shall be equal to one hundred (100) percent of the total cost of materials and installation for the first twelve (12) months, and shall be reduced to fifty (50) percent of the total cost of materials and installation for the remainder of the bond period. The landscape survival bond will be released at the end of the twenty-four-month period. Landscape survival bonds shall be in the form of cash, check, money order, or letter of credit. If cash, check, or money order are utilized to secure a bond, the funds will be placed in an interest bearing escrow account. 
8.16 - Penalties. 
    The city has the authority to levy both civil and administrative penalties for violations of this Article. 
A.  Civil penalty. Violation of this Article constitutes a misdemeanor offense, and is punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per offense. The minimum fine for unauthorized removal of a protected tree is seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). In situations of deforestation, or where attempts have been made to remove evidence of a tree (stump removal, etc.), the maximum fine shall be levied. For the purpose of enforcement, each tree removed shall be treated as a separate offense. Each violation of this Article will constitute a separate offense. 
B.  Administrative penalty. In the event that protected trees and natural vegetation on a site are damaged or destroyed during the development of said site, the city may choose to render an administrative penalty against the developer. The course of action for administrative penalty shall be: 
1.  The building inspections department shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
2.  The City Planner, or his/her designee, shall review the damage and determine the resulting effect upon the approved landscape plan, the site, adjoining properties, and the city in general. 
3.  A moratorium may be placed upon the development. Based upon the severity of the actions, the moratorium will last for a period of up to six (6) months, at the discretion of the city manager. 
4.  Upon request, the developer shall submit a revised tree protection and landscaping plan for review and approval by the planning and zoning commission. 
5.  Once the moratorium has been lifted, the revised tree protection and landscaping plan must be adhered to, in order to avoid further penalty. 
8.17 - Appeals. 
    Any applicant for a land-disturbance permit, a soil erosion and sediment control permit, or a certificate of occupancy who is aggrieved by any decision of the Engineering Director, or City Planner, relating to the application of this Article shall have the right to appeal the Board of Zoning Appeals, as provided under Article 15 of the City of College Park zoning ordinance. 
8.18 - Landscaping and Reforestation Fund. 
A.  Purpose. One (1) of the goals and purposes of the landscaping ordinance is to have each development site offset the impact on the environment of such development by means of providing the required landscaping and pervious surface on the site where such impact occurs. Where minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints or pre-existing development, and not site design or size of the property, the developer/builder may seek permission to donate to the City of College Park landscaping and reforestation fund to compensate for not meeting the requirements of the landscaping ordinance. Unless a variance has been granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals to reduce the size of a buffer, there is no relief from the required landscaping in all buffer zones. Contribution to the landscaping and reforestation fund must be authorized by City Planner, or his/her designee, in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  Natural site constraints and/or pre-existing development prevent the planting of required trees and not development design or the size of the property. 
2.  A maximum of fifty (50) percent of required TDUs for a development can be compensated for. 
B.  Regardless of pre-existing development or variance status, impervious surface of a candidate site outside of downtown College Park may not exceed seventy-five (75) percent. Regardless of pre-existing development or variance status, impervious surface of a candidate site inside Downtown College Park may not exceed ninety (90) percent impervious surface. Pervious pavers, meeting the requirements of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual section 3.3.8 for Modular Porous Paver Systems, will be given credit from impervious surface calculations. Pervious paver systems shall be considered fifty (50) percent pervious and fifty (50) percent impervious for purposes of the calculations. Pervious pavers shall be allowed for use on twenty-five (25) percent of the parking spaces in a parking lot. Pervious pavers are not allowed for use as driveways, or where traffic volumes are high or where heavy duty pavement is needed. 
C.  Authorization process. To receive authorization, a submittal must be made that includes a completed landscaping and reforestation contribution form and the landscaping plan for the site. Review will be conducted within thirty (30) days. 
If approved, donation is to be collected at the time of a mutually established date between the City of College Park Engineering Director and the applicant. 
D.  Landscaping and reforestation fund contribution form. The landscaping and reforestation fund contribution form must be completed and submitted along with other required materials to the City Planner for review. The form shall include the following information: 
1.  Project name, project description, project address, contact name, company name, telephone number, fax number, email address, date of planning and zoning commission development plan approval, conditions of approval, reason for which contribution is necessary, amount of contribution, all contribution calculations and requirements, acres of site, impervious surface calculation, required TDU's, TDU's to be contributed for, area of impervious surface (in square feet) above the maximum limit, supporting documentation list, City Planner and Engineering Director signatures, city manager signature, and the date the check is to be received. 
2.  The submission must also include the following: 
a.  Tree protection and landscaping plan. 
b.  Any supporting documents requested by the planning or engineering departments. 
E.  Assessing cost. In order to compensate for the lack of required landscaping on a given site, land must be obtained by the city, dedicated to open space, planted with the balance of required TDU's, and maintained. In addition, a fixed fee for administrative and consultation services will be incurred. The total cost will be assessed as follows: 
1.  Trees. To calculate the cost required for the required TDU's which are lacking from the site, the following rules shall apply. Three different tree types must be used with no more than fifty (50) percent of the trees being of the same species. The provided trees are given credit for each caliper inch at a rate of fifty (50) percent per required TDU. Price quotes from three (3) different landscapers shall be averaged to determine the total cost for the following: 
a.  Cost of each tree. 
b.  Installation for all trees. 
c.  Maintenance cost per tree for two (2) years. 
F.  Administrative cost is one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). 
G.  Any incurred consultation fees. 
H.  Uses for fund. Donations to this fund serve to offset the lack of pervious surface and landscaping on the site for which a contribution was made. The City Planner and his/her designee(s) will establish and assign priority to all projects for use of funds. In addition to providing landscaping, the city may also initiate and administer such projects that include, but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Purchase land or easements where either specimen trees are located or where a suitable site exists for parkland or the planting of trees. 
2.  Seek out local, state, federal, and private funds for the purpose of landscaping, reforestation, open space, and green space. 
3.  Plant trees and increase landscaping on existing city owned property, including right-of-way as part of a streetscape project. 
4.  Promote the observance of National Arbor Day. 
5.  Further the awareness and the goals of the landscaping ordinance. 
I.  Limitations. The fund cannot be used for the construction of recreational facilities. 
ARTICLE 9. - SIGNS STANDARDS 

9.1. - Purpose, Intent and Applicability. 
A.  The City Council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard, a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city further finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. 
B.  The intent of this Article is to further the goals of the City of College Park's Comprehensive Plan; and establish the following purposes: 
1.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the rights of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of inappropriate signs; 
2.  Further the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan; 
3.  Protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals; 
4.  Minimize vehicular and pedestrian hazards; 
5.  Maintain the historic character of the city; 
6.  Maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts; 
7.  Ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State of Georgia and the United States Constitutions within the city; 
8.  Place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the others of said nonconforming signs; 
9.  Provide for the maintenance of signs, and for the enforcement of the provisions of this Article; 
10.  Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse impacts and visual blight potentially created by signs; 
11.  Promote economic development; and 
12.  Ensure fair and uniform enforcement of sign regulations. 
C.  Applicability. The provisions of this Article shall apply to all signs erected within the corporate limits of the city that are directed to be viewed from any outdoor space(s). All erection, construction, enlargement, moving, altering or converting of signs in the city shall be performed in compliance with the requirements of this Article.

5.  Except for businesses located in planned shopping centers or planned business parks, any signs erected in violation of this section may be removed from any public right-of-way by duly authorized employees of the city, and the responsible party may be cited for such violation. 
6.  No business located in a planned shopping center or planned business park shall be allowed an otherwise conforming sign until it has removed any existing nonconforming signs. 
B.  Any person may file with the inspections department an application for exemption from this Article for a permit for a sign. City staff shall, within thirty (30) days of the filing of the application, recommend that the Mayor and Council review such application for exemption where the following conditions are met: 
1.  The applicant agrees to remove at least one (1) nonconforming sign from the location at issue.

4.  The proposed sign meets all the requirements of this Article. 
5.  Other aspects of the addition of the proposed sign(s) to the location at issue reasonably suggest that the proposed sign would benefit community aesthetics in conformance with the purpose of this Article as described in section 9.1. 
6.  If the provisions above are not met due to the inability of the applicant to remove at least one (1) nonconforming sign, and if any nonconforming signs on such lot were previously agreed to by the city, the city may waive the provisions of this subsection, so long as the aggregate sign area of all signs on such lot does not exceed four hundred (400) square feet for every ten (10) contiguous acres or major fraction thereof. For purposes of determining the aggregate sign area, the city shall exclude the sign area of all nonconforming signs which were previously agreed to by the city.

2.  The benefits of granting the exemption would outweigh the ill effects of allowing the nonconforming sign proposed for removal to remain erected.

4.  There is no negative effect on surrounding property values and that the erection of the proposed sign(s) would afford the applicant a reasonable opportunity to advertise. 
5.  The grant of an exemption in no way confers any vested rights upon the applicant or the exempted plans, applications or requests. 
D.  1.  A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, including face material except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels or painted boards on nonconforming signs shall be permitted.

2.  Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs, structural changes and/or changes in the size, shape or technology currently being used on the sign shall be permitted except to bring the sign out if its nonconforming condition and into compliance with the requirements of this Article.

ARTICLE 11. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, LOTS, AND USES 

11.1 - Intent. 
    Upon adoption of this Code and Official Zoning Map, some structures, lots, and uses may no longer conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located. For this reason, this Article has been generated to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these structures, lots, and uses; referred to as Legal Nonconforming. 
11.2 - Distinction Between illegal Nonconforming and Legal Nonconforming. 
    A structure or lot which was constructed or is being used without an approved Building Permit or approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals or City Council is considered illegal nonconforming. An illegal nonconforming property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this Code and all other applicable City of College Park laws and shall be altered to conform to all applicable standards and regulations of this Code. Further, an illegal nonconforming structure, lot or use is created at the fault of the owner, tenant or property manager. 
    Legal Nonconforming differs from illegal Nonconforming in that the reason for the nonconformance is caused by the enactment of a Zoning Code or a change to the Zoning Code (including the Official Zoning Map). The structure, lot or use has not changed, but due to the Zoning Code enactment or change, the property no longer conforms to the policies and standards of the zoning district in which it is located. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed Legal Nonconforming or "Grandfathered." 
11.3 - Nonconforming Structures. 
    Any structure, lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Code, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the developmental standards shall be deemed a Legal Nonconforming Structure. 
    A legal nonconforming structure may continue provided that it remains the same or fits within the below described tolerances: 
A.  Any legal nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in a manner that increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be expanded within the allowable building envelope or altered in a manner to decrease its nonconformity. 
B.  Any legal nonconforming structure which is intentionally altered to conform to the requirements of this Code shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located, and the legal nonconforming features may not be resumed. 
C.  If a building or structure is moved for any reason, for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this Code. 
    The intent, and any evidence thereof, of any owner and/or user of a building or land, to discontinue or abandon the use shall be irrelevant in determining whether discontinuance or abandonment has in fact occurred. Instead, the determination of such discontinuance or abandonment shall be based upon such objective evidence as would lead a reasonable observer of actual use of the building or land, to believe that discontinuance or abandonment of the use has in fact occurred. This subsection shall not apply to legal nonconforming uses in existence on or before September 15, 2003. 
11.4 - Nonconforming Lots of Record. 
    All lots legally established and recorded prior to the effective date of this Code, or its subsequent amendments that no longer meet any applicable provision of this Code shall be deemed a Legal Nonconforming Lot of Record. Legal Nonconforming Lots of Record may be built upon only if the proposed use is permitted and all development standards of the applicable zoning district of this Code are met. Any lot which met minimum lot standard area at the time it was created, shall be deemed buildable for a single family residence. 
11.5 - Nonconforming Uses of Structures, Land, or Structures and Land in Combination. 
    Any lawful use of structures, land, or structures and land in combination established prior to the effective date of this Code or its subsequent amendments that is no longer a permitted use in the district where it is located shall be deemed a Legal Nonconforming Use. A legal nonconforming use may continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions: 
A.  Existing structures devoted to a legal nonconforming use shall only be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended, constructed, or structurally altered in accordance with the Zoning District Standards identified in Article 3. Furthermore, the use of the structure may be altered to a use permitted in the district in which it is located or as otherwise specified in this Article. 
B.  No structure shall be constructed in connection with an existing legal nonconforming use of land. 
C.  Any legal nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were plainly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this Code or its subsequent amendments, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building. 
D.  No legal nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased, extended to occupy a greater area of land, or moved in whole or in part to any other portion of a lot than was occupied at the effective date of this Code. 
E.  If a legal nonconforming use is intentionally discontinued for six (6) months or longer, any subsequent use of such land, structure or land and structure shall conform to the provisions of this Code. The intent, and any evidence thereof, of any owner and/or user of a building or land, to discontinue or abandon the use shall be irrelevant in determining whether discontinuance or abandonment has in fact occurred. Instead, the determination of such discontinuance or abandonment shall be based upon such objective evidence as would lead a reasonable observer of actual use of the building or land, to believe that discontinuance or abandonment of the use has in fact occurred. This subsection shall not apply to legal nonconforming uses in existence on or before September 15, 2003. 
F.  Uses which are required to be discontinued due to government action which impedes access to the premises, or damage resulting from fire, flood, other natural disaster, or a criminal act shall be exempt from this provision. Such exempt uses, if rebuilt or restored, shall be identical in scale, lot coverage, and all other aspects to that which was discontinued. 
G.  When a legal nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located, the legal nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
11.6 - Repairs and Maintenance. 
    The following applies to legal nonconforming structures and legal nonconforming uses of structures, or structures and land in combination: 
A.  Work may be done for ordinary repairs or replacement of walls, heating, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing; under the condition that the cubic content existing when the structure became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
B.  If a structure becomes unsafe or unlawful due to physical condition and is razed, the structure shall be rebuilt in conformity with the district in which it is located. 
C.  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing, or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting public safety upon order of such official.

1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question, because of its size, shape or topography; 
2.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; 
3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
4.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter and the city Comprehensive Plan text, however, no variance may be granted for a use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter;
