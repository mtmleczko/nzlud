PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sanford, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1973 Code, as supplemented through February 23, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter 
of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Code Attorney and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the members of the city staff for, their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The Charter of the City of Sanford, adopted by the City Commission on September 16, 1996, approved by the voters of the city on December 3, 1996, is set out herein. 
State Law reference- Municipal home rule powers, F.S. ch. 166. 

ARTICLE I. - POWERS OF THE CITY 

Section 1.01. - Powers of the city. 
    The City of Sanford, Florida, shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the constitution and laws of this state as fully and completely as though they were specifically enumerated in this charter. 
Section 1.02. - Construction. 
    The powers of the city under this charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the city, and the specific mention of particular powers in the charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers stated in this article. 
Section 1.03. - Intergovernmental relations. 
    The city may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with any one or more states or civil divisions or agencies thereof, or the United States or any agency thereof. 
Section 1.04. - Description of corporate limits. 
    The corporate limits of the City of Sanford, Florida, shall be those in effect on the date this Charter is ratified by the voters of the City of Sanford and said corporate limits may be amended by ordinance. 
Section 1.05. - Annexation. 
    The territorial boundaries of the City of Sanford may be extended as provided by General Acts, Laws of Florida. 
ARTICLE II. - CITY COMMISSION[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
(a) The City staff report and City Commission agenda memorandum relating to this matter can be relied upon to facilitate the understanding of the legislative intent relating to the provisions of this Ordinance. 
(b) The City of Sanford has complied with all requirements and procedures of Florida law in processing and advertising this Ordinance. 
(c) Recent changes in Federal law pertaining to elections, the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (the "MOVE Act") (Public Law 111 - 84 which is part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010), have potentially impacted the operations of local government election officials. Beginning with the November, 2010 general elections, State election officials are now required to send ballots to overseas citizens 45 days before an election except under emergency circumstances and election officials must also make blank ballots available electronically either by fax, e-mail, or internet download. These legal requirements could affect the elections of the City of Sanford in a potentially significant manner in that, although the MOVE Act relates to Federal elections, the general principle of law is that overseas citizens should warrant respect of their franchise in all elections. The 45-day period referenced above, would, in actuality, be, of necessity, a 60-day period in that certification of the election is a 12-day process and, thus, although the City would normatively schedule a runoff election within weeks of the General Election; the 60-day period between the General Election and the runoff is problematic. Section 100.3605(2), Florida Statutes, provides that the governing body of a municipality, such as the City Commission, may, by ordinance, "... change the dates for qualifying and for the election of members of the governing body of the municipality and provide for the orderly transition of office resulting from such date changes." Section 166.021(4), Florida Statutes, also states in pertinent part that: 
... nothing in this act shall be construed to permit any changes in a special law or municipal charter which affect the exercise of extraterritorial powers or which affect an area which includes lands within and without a municipality or any changes in a special law or municipal charter which affect ... the terms of elected officers and the manner of their election except for the selection of election dates and qualifying periods for candidates and for changes in terms of office necessitated by such changes in election dates ... without approval by referendum of the electors as provided in F.S. § 166.031. (Emphasis added). 
Both the language in Section 166.021(4), Florida Statutes, and Section 100.3605(2), Florida Statutes, were added to State statutory law by the Florida Legislature when it enacted Chapter 95-178, Laws of Florida and the Attorney General of the State of Florida has issued several opinions relative to related legal issues and stated in Attorney General Opinion (AGO) Number 2009-47, dated October 13, 2009, to Kevin D. Obos, Springfield City Attorney, that "[i]n considering the 1995 legislation, this office has stated that an examination of the legislative history reflects an intent that municipalities would be authorized to amend their charters to change the election dates and qualifying periods for candidates, including any changes in terms of office necessitated by the amendment, without a referendum." In AGO 2009-47, the Attorney General concluded that: 
 The City of Springfield may, by the same referendum, amend its charter to change the terms of elected officers from two years to four years and extend the terms of the currently elected mayor and two of the commissioners by one additional year. 
Prior to AGO 2009-47, the Attorney General issued AGO Number 2003-52, dated November 3, 2003, issued to James C. Brady on behalf of the Mayor and City Commission of the City of Lauderdale Lakes and stated that: 
 Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the City of Lauderdale Lakes, pursuant to sections 166.021(4) and 100.3605, Florida Statutes, may amend its city charter by ordinance to move the dates of city elections from March to November to coincide with federal, state, and county elections, and to extend the terms of the sitting commissioners to November, when the existing charter was last amended in January 1998. 
In AGO Number 2000-61, dated October 6, 2000, issued to Mr. Frank Comparetto, Jr., Mulberry City Attorney, the Attorney General opined that: 
 Pursuant to section 100.3605, Florida Statutes, the City of Mulberry may by ordinance amend its city charter to move the dates of city elections from April to November to coincide with federal, state, and county elections and to extend the terms of the sitting commissioners to November. 
It is, thus, well settled in Florida law that the City Commission has the power to adjust periods of qualifying for office and the associated terms of office. 

Section 2.01. - Composition, terms, and eligibility. 
(a)  City Commission. The local governing body of the City shall be a City Commission consisting of a Mayor, who shall also be known as a Commissioner, and either four (4) or six (6) City Commissioners in number, as determined by ordinance enacted by the City Commission, all of whom shall be elected for a term of four (4) years both commencing and terminating on the second Monday in December. The City Commissioners holding office shall continue in office until their present terms of office expire and until their successors are elected and take office, unless vacancies therein otherwise occur. 
(b)  Eligibility. Only qualified voters of the city shall be eligible to hold office of commissioner. No person shall run for more than one commission seat in an election and no person shall run for mayor and a commission seat in the same election. 
(Ord. No. 4148, § 2, 8-26-2008/12-8-08; Ord. No. 4274, § 2, 6-25-2012; Ord. No. 4453, §§ 1, 5, 5-14-2018; Res. No. 2752, § 2(a)(4), 9-24-2018) 
Note- Refer to footnote in Article II, City Commission.

(Ord. No. 4318, § 1, 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-36. - Definitions. 
    The following words, as used herein, shall have the following meanings as set forth below and the substantive provisions set forth in each definition shall be applicable in accordance with the terms thereof: 
    Actual cost of duplication means the cost of the material and supplies used to duplicate the public record, but does not include the costs of labor or overhead costs associated with such duplication. 
    Custodian means any person who has supervision and control over a public record or legal responsibility for its care, keeping or guardianship including, but not limited to, the city clerk and the department custodian required herein. 
    Custodians of public record shall ensure that they are familiar with the provisions of the controlling provisions of state law which relate to public records and related matters to include, but not be limited to, the following: 
    Public records means all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, data processing software, or other materials, regardless of physical form, characteristics, or means of transmission made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by the City of Sanford. 
The following shall not be public records requests and are not subject to the provisions of this article: 
(1)  A request that is in the form of an interrogatory or question asking the city to provide written or oral answers or information even if the answers could be derived from an inspection of public records.

(Ord. No. 4318, § 2, 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-37. - General guidelines. 
(a)  All custodians shall permit the inspection and examination of public records by any person desiring to do so, at any reasonable time, under reasonable conditions, and under supervision of the custodian of the public record or the custodian's designee. The identity of the custodian's designee shall be disclosed to the person requesting to inspect or copy public records. All custodians or their designees shall acknowledge requests to inspect or copy records promptly and respond to such requests in good faith. A good faith response includes making reasonable efforts to determine from other officers or employees whether such a record exists and, if so, the location at which the record can be inspected. 
(1)  Reasonable time. An automatic delay in producing public records shall not be imposed before allowing access to public records. However, the custodian shall be allowed a reasonable time to retrieve the public records and delete those portions of the record the custodian asserts are exempt from public records disclosure. If satisfying the request immediately would unduly interfere with the operation of the department, however, the custodian will arrange a mutually satisfactory time for fulfilling the request. This will vary according to the circumstances of the request for public records including, but not limited to, the number of records requested and reviewed, the number of years of public records requested and reviewed, the department's filing system, storage of records, and any other factor affecting the retrieval and copying of public records. Upon receipt of a public records request the custodian will promptly issue the requestor a written acknowledgement of the public records request and the approximate date and time the individual can pick up the public records requested. 
(2)  Reasonable conditions. The custodian shall neither prohibit the inspection and copying of public records nor create burdensome constraints designed to preclude such inspection and copying. Notwithstanding, the custodian shall, as circumstances dictate, take appropriate and reasonable steps that would permit the custodian to protect public records from alteration, damage, theft or destruction. 
(b)  Custodians should be familiar with the following requirements of the Florida Public Records Law when a public records request is made to inspect or copy a record and the custodian should advise the public of the same when appropriate: 
(1)  Individuals are not required to identify themselves or make the request in person, in writing or any other particular format, nor give a reason for such request; 
(2)  Individuals may not be denied access to public records due to the lack of specifics of the record they wish to inspect or copy; 
(3)  Computerized public records are governed by the same rule as written documents and other public records. Information stored on a computer is as much a public record as a written page or a tabulation in a file stored in a file cabinet. 
(4)  Custodians are not required to verbally give out information contained in a public record. The custodian's obligation is to provide access to, or copies of, the public records being requested. 
(5)  Custodians are not required to produce records in a particular form or format as demanded by the requestor, nor tailored to the requestor's specific needs. If a particular form or format of a public record does not exist because it is not ordinarily created, filed, produced, maintained, or used in that form by the city, a custodian is not required, upon request, to create that public record in such form or format. 
(6)  If an attorney, or a person from an attorney's staff or a person otherwise works for an attorney, requests to inspect or copy public records regarding a pending lawsuit which may or may not involve the city, the city attorney shall be promptly notified and the city attorney will evaluate the matter and determine the response relating to the request. The city's risk manager shall be advised by the city attorney of any requests to inspect or copy public records which may result from or result in a claim or litigation being filed against the city. A set of the documents copied for a requestor shall be kept and provided to the city attorney upon request. 
(7)  No special service charge or fee may be imposed for the mere inspection and examination of public records by the general public unless the nature or volume of the public records to be inspected is such as to require extensive use of information technology resources or extensive clerical or supervisory assistance. As set forth in section 1-41 of this public records policy, a special service charge or fee shall be required when extensive use of information technology resources or extensive clerical or supervisory assistance is required to locate, review for confidential information, copy and re-file requested public records. 
(8)  Custodians should advise those individuals requesting copies of public records that may be copyrighted that copying such records may be subject to federal copyright laws and penalties. 
(c)  If a public records request is insufficient to identify the records sought, the custodian shall promptly notify the requestor that more information is needed in order to produce the records. 
(Ord. No. 4318, § 2(F), 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-38. - Designated custodians. 
(a)  The city clerk is hereby designated the Supervisor of Public Records for the City of Sanford and shall have full authority to implement the provisions of this resolution in consultation with the city manager and city attorney. The city clerk shall have full authority to manage and coordinate the inspection and copying of public records requested by the general public consistent with this policy including employment of a records manager to oversee these functions. 
(b)  Each department director of the city is hereby designated custodian of public records for their respective departments and the director shall designate one or more assistants (records liaisons) within their department for purposes of implementing this policy. The custodian will be responsible for handling, in coordination with, and at the direction of, the city clerk, requests for public records which are relevant to the department, whether the request is made directly to the department, to the city clerk, or any other city personnel. 
(Ord. No. 4318, § 2(G), 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-39. - Procedure. 
(a)  When a request for inspection or copies of public records is received, the request shall be documented on a form which shall be completed by the city employee receiving the request. The city shall never require a person to place a request in writing. The form is for the administrative use of the city and it shall be the obligation of each city employee to ensure that such requests are documented. 
All requests to inspect and copy public records shall be managed by, and coordinated through, the city clerk's office in accordance with this public records policy. The city clerk's office will create and maintain a public records log noting requests made for public records, including the date of the request, the information requested, the date the request was completed, fees and special service charges (if any), and any other information deemed pertinent by the city clerk to efficiently manage public records requests. 
(b)  Should any person request public records directly from any department (other than the city clerk's office and the police and fire departments); the department's custodian shall promptly acknowledge receipt of the request and notify the city clerk's office of the request. The city clerk will immediately log the request and coordinate with the department's custodian, and any other department which may have a public record being requested, the retrieval and/or copying of the public records. The city clerk's office and the department's custodian will ensure that the inspection and copying of the public records request has been completed and delivered to the requestor. 
(c)  Should any person request public records directly from the police or fire department, and the public records are on file with the police or fire department, the department's custodian shall handle the request for public records. Public records not on file with the police or fire department shall be coordinated with, and handled by, the city clerk's office. The police and fire departments shall each keep a public records log of requests made to the department in a form approved by the city clerk's office. Copies of the log shall be provided to the city clerk's office for tracking purposes. 
(d)  The city clerk shall handle all requests for public records on file with the city clerk. If the request can be immediately honored, then the inspection or copying of the records shall be implemented immediately and the city clerk shall be notified of the request and actions in response to the request. If the request cannot be immediately honored, the requestor shall be so advised. The request shall then immediately be referred to the city clerk for processing. In any event, either the city clerk or the records custodian shall immediately acknowledge the request in writing using such information as the requestor may have provided. 
(e)  The city clerk shall then promptly develop an estimate of the number of copies, CDs, tapes or other types of records necessary to fulfill the request, and the estimated charges to accomplish the request to include an estimate of any special service charge and the rationale for such charge. The estimate shall be provided to the requestor in an expeditious manner. 
(f)  The person requesting the public records shall pay the total estimated charges prior to the preparation and production of the requested public records. 
(g)  Upon payment by the person requesting the public records, the city shall produce the requested public records as soon as possible. The city shall be responsible for reviewing all records for possible exemptions to the open public records requirement. 
(h)  Adjustments shall be made in the amount charged for the public records upon production of the requested public records if the actual charge differs from the estimated charge. Additional amounts due must be paid to the city before the public records are produced. 
(i)  Should the city clerk receive a request for public records which are not on file with the city clerk, the city clerk shall forward said request to the affected department and the department's custodian shall be responsible for retrieving and/or copying the public records and forwarding them to the city clerk in accordance with this public records policy. 
(j)  Any person may request and receive public records of the city. No charge shall be imposed for inspection of public records unless public records are requested. It is prohibited and unlawful to violate the provisions of this article and the violation of the provisions of this article shall subject a city employee to disciplinary action up to termination of employment with the city. 
(k)  Should any person making a request for public records from any department of the city feel that the department has restricted or circumvented their right to inspect public records, said person shall make their request to the city clerk for resolution. 
(l)  The mayor and city commissioners, city manager, and city attorney will be advised immediately of any formal citizen or news media complaints and lawsuits filed against the city regarding access to public records. 
(Ord. No. 4318, § 2(H), 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-40. - Exempt and confidential records. 
(a)  Florida law provides that some public records are confidential and exempt from public records disclosure. It is the policy of the City of Sanford that exempt and confidential public records shall not be disclosed to the public. All custodians shall take reasonable steps to ensure that exempt and confidential records are not improperly released to the public and that records are properly redacted prior to release. 
(b)  The City of Sanford "Request for Confidentiality" form shall be made available to individuals seeking to make confidential those public records of the city which contain certain personal identifying information which is exempt from disclosure pursuant to F.S. ch. 119. City employees shall complete said "Request for Confidentiality" form annually to assist the city in meeting its statutory obligation to keep the personal identifying information of its employees confidential and exempt from disclosure where provided by law. Completed "request for confidentiality" forms shall be notarized and submitted to the office of the city clerk for processing. 
(c)  Any custodian who has a question regarding whether a certain public record, or portion thereof, is exempt or confidential should address the matter with their department director. If the department director cannot determine whether the public record is exempt or confidential, the city clerk should be contacted to address the matter. If the city clerk cannot make such a determination, the city attorney shall be contacted to determine whether a public record should be declared by the city to be exempt from public records disclosure or confidential. A record referred to the city attorney for review shall not be made public until the city attorney has made a final determination of the legal questions presented. The city attorney shall review all public records requests which present a legal question as to whether a record contains information which is confidential or exempt. 
(d)  If the custodian asserts that a record, or part of a record, is exempt from public records disclosure, the custodian shall deny the public records request and state in writing to the requestor the basis of the exemption which the custodian believes is applicable to the record, including the statutory citation to the exemption. 
(e)  If the custodian asserts that only a portion of a record is exempt or confidential, the custodian shall delete or redact the exempt or confidential portion of the record and produce the remainder of the record which is not exempt or confidential. A custodian may comply with this subsection by using any reasonable method which maintains and does not destroy the exempted portion while allowing public inspection of the nonexempt portion. 
(f)  Any public record related to a federal agency which contains information that is suspected of being confidential, and said record is deemed public and open for inspection and copying by Florida law, should be examined to determine whether a federal statute (i.e. The Freedom of Information Act, U.S.C. Section 552) requires the particular information to be exempt from public disclosure. 
(Ord. No. 4318, § 2(I), 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-41. - Public records fee schedule. 
(a)  Any person requesting copies of public records shall be charged a copying fee, as follows: 
(1)  Normative charges. Unless specifically stated otherwise in State law, the following statutory fees will apply to copying of public records: 
a.  Paper size up to and including 81/2? × 11?, 81/2? × 14?, or 11? × 17?: 
1.  Single-sided page: $0.15 per page. 
2.  Double-sided page: $0.25 per page. 
b.  All other copies: Actual cost of duplication. 
c.  Certified copy: One + pages: $1.00 per certified document. 
d.  Audio tape and CD fees (audio tapes and CDs (if applicable) may require several days to reproduce), including research and labor: 
1.  Audio tapes: Actual cost to city. 
2.  Data CD: Actual cost to city. 
3.  Audio CD: Actual cost to city. 
4.  Digital copy of any document on a CD: $5.00. 
If the records request is such as to require extensive use of information technology resources or extensive clerical or supervisory assistance by personnel of the city (which shall mean in excess of 20 minutes) in addition to the actual cost of duplication, then an additional service charge equal to the actual cost incurred for such extensive use of information technology resources plus the labor cost of the personnel providing the service will be charged. "Information technology resources" is defined as data processing hardware and software and services, communications, supplies, personnel, facility resources, maintenance and training; provided, however, that the term does not include a videotape or a machine to view a videotape. 
The city clerk shall determine the appropriate charge and such charge shall be no more than the actual costs to the city and shall be calculated in a manner which shall not deter the public from making or pursuing public records requests. The city shall charge no more than the actual cost of the city personnel's time and shall be sensitive to accommodating the request in such a way as to ensure unfettered access while safeguarding the records. In keeping with the City of Sanford's' commitment to provide open access to public records, there will be no special service charge for requests requiring 20 minutes or less in actual labor. However, when a person requests public records which require more than 20 minutes in actual service to locate, review for confidential information, copy and re-file the requested public records, the person will be charged for all time expended above 20 minutes. Charges include a city employee's salary in calculating labor costs for the special service charge, recognizing, however, that charges must be reasonable and based upon the actual labor costs incurred by or attributable to the city and the city shall charge a clerical rate for the time spent making copies, even if due to staff shortages, a more highly paid person does the work. Based upon the length of time estimated to provide the service and the cost of copying, a reasonable deposit may be collected prior to the cost actually being incurred. Unless the city clerk determines a labor cost to the contrary, such costs shall be calculated by multiplying the hourly rate of an employee by 1.0. Monies collected exceeding the actual cost of assistance and copying shall be returned to the person requesting the public records. 
(b)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the city from providing free copies of public records to the news media, government agencies, and public service charitable groups for purposes of disseminating information to the public, such as, copies of city newsletters, city commission and other city board agendas, and press releases. 
(Ord. No. 4318, § 2(J), 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-42. - Establishment of City of Sanford Public Records Access Policy; public records copy request procedures. 
(a)  It is the policy of the City of Sanford, Florida, that all public records as defined in F.S. ch. 119, be open for public inspection, free of any charge, subject to such exemptions as provided by law. Charges may be assessed in accordance with state law and to ensure that the citizens of the city and state (as well as those interested in City of Sanford governmental matters) are afforded their constitutional and statutory rights to access public records. It is also the policy of the City of Sanford to ensure that the city acts in manners which demonstrate competency with enhancements and ongoing developments in the area of information technology such as, by way of example only, text messaging and similar messaging technology and communications utilizing the most contemporary technology. All custodians of city public records shall permit the inspection and examination of public records by any person desiring to do so, at any reasonable time, under reasonable conditions, and under supervision by the custodian of the public record or the custodian's designee provided, however, the custodian shall remain responsible to ensure that access to public records is afforded to requesting parties. 
(b)  It shall be the responsibility of the city clerk to monitor compliance with the policies and procedures established in this article and implement the provisions of this article on a day-to-day basis. The city clerk shall be the city's centralized public records contact person for tracking public records requests submitted to all city departments and offices. 
(c)  The city clerk is hereby declared to be the records custodian and manager of all city public records and shall have authority to implement the provisions of this article in consultation with the city manager and city attorney; provided, however, that each department director and manager of an office within city government shall be deemed to be a custodian of public records for the purposes of implementing the provisions of this article. Assistant custodians may be designated, in writing, with the designee executing the written designation and acknowledging the requirements relating to that designation and this article. With regard to the operations of the police department and the fire department, both the police chief and the fire chief shall have the obligations of the city clerk for the requirements of this article as they relate to their respective departments in terms of complying with public records requests directed to public records pertaining to records maintained within those departments; provided, however, that the police chief and fire chief may designate, in writing, with the designee executing the written designation and acknowledging the requirements relating to that designation and this article, the responsibility for being the primary person responsible for public records matters within those respective departments. 
(d)  The city attorney shall provide an annual report to the city commission relating to changes in public records laws. The city clerk shall provide an annual report relating to access to city records and compliance with the provisions of this article. 
(e)  To the extent not implemented by this article, the provisions of Resolution Number 2177 (Records Management Program) shall be implemented by the city manager, in conjunction with the city clerk and city attorney, by means of the adoption of administrative rules. 
(Ord. No. 4318, § 3, 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-43. - Destruction of public records. 
    Pursuant to the requirements of F.S. § 119.041, the Records Custodians, through the city clerk's office, shall systematically dispose of their departments' public records no longer needed by the city, in accordance with the provisions of adopted Resolution No. 2177. 
(Ord. No. 4318, § 3(K), 4-14-2014) 
Sec. 1-44. - Relationship to Florida and federal public records laws. 
    Nothing herein is intended in any way to conflict with or abrogate F.S. ch. 119, or any other applicable Florida or federal laws. In the event of any conflict between this policy and any Florida or federal law, the conflicting provision of the Florida or federal law shall prevail and apply.

Sec. 2-122. - Organizational provisions. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all boards, commissions or committees, except to the extent otherwise specified in state statute or otherwise provided in this Code, as well as the actions, insofar as practicable, of a city special magistrate, hearing officer or staff person assigned an adjudicative duty. This section shall not apply to the city's canvassing boards as may be established from time-to-time, to the special events review committee, to the development review committee, the plans review committee or entities of a similar nature, when so specified by the city commission; provided, however, that the provisions of state law relative to public records, public meetings, public notices, participation by the public, the creation and approval of minutes and similar procedural requirements shall be applicable. 
(b)  Positions; qualifications; residency. Each member shall be appointed to a specific numbered position. Absent a controlling provision in federal, state, county or city law, ordinance, rule or regulation, every appointee must, to the extent practicable as determined in the sole discretion of the city commission, at the time of appointment, be a resident of the city and an elector of Seminole County; provided, however, that this requirement may be waived by a four-fifths vote of the city commission. A member who ceases to meet a requirement for qualification, shall be deemed to have resigned upon the failure to maintain the qualification for office and shall be replaced at any time thereafter by the city commission, but may continue to serve on an interim basis until a successor is qualified and appointed if the member's interim service is approved by the city commission. 
(c)  Terms. Each position shall have a four-year term of office with each beginning on October 1 of a calendar year. Each member appointed shall serve for the specific term, or the unexpired portion thereof, of the specific position to which the member is appointed. A qualified member shall also serve after the expiration of a term of office until a successor is appointed. The provisions of this subsection relating to terms of four years shall not apply to the board of trustees of the firefighters' retirement system and the board of trustees of the police officers' retirement system. 
(d)  Vacancies. In the event of death, resignation, removal from office or any other vacancy, a successor shall be appointed to serve the remaining unexpired portion of the specific term of office of the vacant position. 
(e)  Removal. The city commission may, by majority vote, remove a member for cause upon written charges after notice and public hearing by reason of (i) three unexcused absences within a 12-month period as determined by the city commission or (ii) misfeasance, malfeasance or dereliction of duty or such other conduct that provides for removal under a controlling provision of law including, but not limited to, the "City of Sanford Governmental Public Officials Ethics Ordinance". 
(f)  Officers. The city commission may, from time-to-time, designate one member as the presiding officer who shall serve until another presiding officer is designated. A chairperson and vice-chairperson shall be elected from the members at the first meeting of each calendar year. 
(g)  No compensation. Members shall receive no compensation for their services. 
(h)  Quorum. A quorum is half the number of the voting membership, including alternate members who are participating as voting members, of the board, commission or committee. After a meeting is called to order, the only appropriate action in the event of a non-quorum is to continue the meeting; provided, however, that the attending members of the body may discuss matters of a non-quasi-judicial nature and matters that are not, and will not be, the subject of a noticed public hearing. No voting shall take place absent a quorum. Continuances of meetings and hearings may be accomplished administratively without the vote of a quorum due to inclement weather conditions, emergency circumstances and administrative necessity when the chairperson of the body concurs in such action proposed by city staff and, in such circumstances, the designated city staff liaison to that board shall attend the meeting, if possible, and announce a continuance of the meeting or hearing to a date that is approved by the chairperson. In the event of the unavailability of the chairperson to make decisions as set forth in this subsection, the vice-chairperson or, if no vice-chairperson is in office, the member with the longest service on the body shall make such determinations. In the event of a continuance under the provisions of this subsection, city staff shall take all reasonable and appropriate actions to notice the meeting or hearing and to ensure that all affected parties are advised of the new date of the meeting or hearing. 
(i)  Term limits. No member shall serve more than three consecutive terms on the same board, commission, or committee. This term limitation shall not apply to the Firefighters Retirement System Board of Trustees and the Police Officers Retirement System Board of Trustees. 
(j)  Absences. Each regular member and each alternate member shall notify the designated city staff liaison when it is anticipated that the member will be absent from a meeting. At the meeting, the body may vote to excuse the absence provided that the staff liaison was notified at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled meeting; provided, however, that less notice will be acceptable in the event of exigent circumstances facing the member and causing the absence. 
(k)  Alternate members. In addition to appointing regular members, the City Commission may also appoint alternate members in such numbers as it deems appropriate to serve in the event of absences by regular members; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to appointments to the Firefighters Retirement System Board of Trustees and the Police Officers Retirement System Board of Trustees. Alternate members shall have all of the rights and privileges of regular members and shall be subject to the same requirements as regular members. Alternate members may attend all meetings of the body to which appointed, but may only vote when filling the position of an absent member either for an entire meeting or a particular vote or set of votes at a meeting depending upon the duration of the absence of a member; provided, however, that once a member is absent from a meeting, that member shall not regain his or her seat on the body unless a quorum is lacking in the meeting subsequent to his or her absence. Alternate members shall not participate in the debate on matters that are quasi-judicial in nature when not sitting as a voting member, but the chairperson, in his or her discretion, may permit participation of alternate members when matters are advisory in nature. Alternate members may serve in the absence of a member of the body whether for an entire meeting or for a particular vote or set of votes at a meeting. If more than one alternate is appointed to a body, they shall serve in a rotational method or by means of the order of appointment if no rotation has been established with the first appointed alternate member serving first. It is the duty of members to advise the staff liaison of their expected absence from a meeting as early as possible. 
(l)  Method of creation. Advisory bodies shall be created by resolution as opposed to ordinance except in unusual circumstances or in the event that controlling law requires otherwise. 
(m)  District representation. In appropriate circumstances the city commission shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that city commission districts are as equally represented as practicable. 
(n)  Rules of procedure. All proceedings shall be guided by the latest edition of Roberts Rules of Order in a manner which allows the body to function in an organized manner, but without technical adherence thereto. Motions for reconsideration may only be heard at the next session of a body occurring after the meeting at which the vote desired to be reconsidered occurred. Any member of the body, regardless of whether he or she voted at the prior meeting, may move for reconsideration provided that such moving member did not vote on the non-prevailing side at the prior meeting with regard to such vote. If a matter that was determined at an advertised public hearing is later determined to be reconsidered, public notice shall be published consistent with the requirements that were applicable when the vote that is to reconsidered was taken and an explanation of the reconsideration process shall be incorporated into the public notices relating to the matter. 
(o)  Bylaws; applicable laws. Unless otherwise empowered by federal, state, county or city law, ordinance, rule or regulation, no bylaws shall be adopted by the body and matters within the jurisdiction of the body shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the creating city code provision, ordinance or resolution. The provisions of Florida law relating to public records, public notices, participation by the public, the creation and approval of minutes and public meetings shall apply to all city boards, commissions and committees except to the extent explicitly provided otherwise in state law. If federal law requires certain processes and procedures, then the board, commission or committee subject to such requirement, shall ensure that full compliance is maintained. Each body shall cause its designated secretary to provide approved executed minutes for each meeting to the city clerk at the end of the month following the month during week a meeting occurred and to ensure that minutes for all meetings are posted upon the city's meetings web page. Each body shall cause its designated secretary to post all meeting notices and agendas in accordance with controlling law, upon the city's web page calendar and as otherwise is required by the procedures and processes promulgated by the city clerk in conjunction with the city attorney. All actions and activities of each body shall be accomplished in full compliance with the requirements of open and transparent government under the guidance of the city attorney who shall also guide and direct adherence to the requirements of law relative to quasi-judicial proceedings of all bodies. The city clerk shall endeavor to maximize public notice of meetings and hearings of the city as well and public information relative to the actions taken at such meetings and hearings to include, but not be limited to, the use of technology for the provision of notices and records relating to the boards, commissions or committees of the city insofar as practicable. 
(p)  Ethics training. All members of each body shall, unless otherwise required to do so by controlling law, attend an ethics and Sunshine Law training session each calendar year which training session shall be coordinated by the city clerk and the city attorney.

DIVISION 2. - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMERCIAL LOAN SUBSIDY PROGRAM 

Sec. 2-369. - Creation of economic development commercial loan subsidy program; purposes; responsibilities; policies; procedures; alternative grant program. 
(a)  The city commission of the City of Sanford, in conjunction with the Community Redevelopment Agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area, hereby creates and establishes the City of Sanford Economic Development Commercial Loan Subsidy Program to be implemented by the agency. 
(b)  The purpose of the program is to encourage the renovation and productive use of buildings in the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area which shall be within the city limits of the City of Sanford. The program will assist business owners to redevelop properties. The program will provide a subsidy, under appropriate circumstances, to effectively reduce the interest rate on market loans for building renovations to one percent amortized for a 20-year term based on the loan interest rate, as established in the application and as may be approved in the application process set forth in this article, which shall be the loan interest rate at time of loan closing. 
(c)  Loan proceeds may only be used for the rehabilitation of properties within the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area. 
(d)  Only real property that is assigned a commercial zoning classification consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and that will be used for a nonresidential or mixed use purpose (as set forth in a binding development order) are eligible under the program for subsidy assistance. 
(e)  Loan subsidies may be made only to the property owner and may only be used for renovations and not for the purchase price of a parcel of real property. 
(f)  Normative loan underwriting criteria and documentation must be satisfied as part of the transaction to protect the city's interests, as well as the interests of the community redevelopment agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area, under the authority and guidance of the finance director in conjunction with the city attorney. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a recipient of a loan subsidy, who enters an agreement to implement the subsidy after November 1, 2010, receives financing from a commercial bank or other financial institution of a similar nature that is chartered 1 under either federal or Florida law (but not private loan funding of any nature); the position of the public funds guarantees may be placed in a secondary position to the position of the bank/financial institution. 
(g)  Loans by the community redevelopment agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area under the program shall be secured by a declining balance property rehabilitation lien, in a form of legal instrument approved by the city attorney, for a term of ten years. Should the owner sell or transfer title to the real property during this term the prorated balance of the city's subsidy shall be paid to the city at the time of closing. Should the applicant maintain ownership for the full ten-year term, the loan provided by the agency shall be fully amortized and shall be satisfied of record in a form acceptable to the city attorney. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a recipient of a loan subsidy, who enters an agreement to implement the subsidy after November 1, 2010, receives financing from a commercial bank or other financial institution of a similar nature that is chartered under either federal or Florida law (but not private loan funding of any nature); the position of the public funds guarantees may be placed in a secondary position to the position of the bank/financial institution. 
(h)  The maximum total loan amount to be subsidized is $300,000.00. The subsidy rate is based on a projected 20-year amortization. 2 
(i)  Neither the city nor any of its agencies to include, but not limited to, the community redevelopment agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area, shall in any way guarantee the underlying loan for the real property and the city does not pledge its full faith and credit to any extent by enacting or implementing this article and shall not be deemed to have done so to any degree or extent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a recipient of a loan subsidy, who enters an agreement to implement the subsidy after November 1, 2010, receives financing from a commercial bank or other financial institution of a similar nature that is chartered under either federal or Florida law (but not private loan funding of any nature); the position of the public funds guarantees may be placed in a secondary position to the position of the bank/financial institution. 
(j)  The loan applicant must submit documentation to the community redevelopment agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area detailing the renovation to be performed as well as details concerning the proposed loan. If approved by the agency, the agency will then issue a letter approving the subsidy subject to normal underwriting criteria as approved and established by the finance director in conjunction with the city attorney. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a recipient of a loan subsidy, who enters an agreement to implement the subsidy after November 1, 2010, receives financing from a commercial bank or other financial institution of a similar nature that is chartered under either federal or Florida law (but not private loan funding of any nature); the position of the public funds guarantees may be placed in a secondary position to the position of the bank/financial institution. 
(k)  Once the loan is approved, the applicant must submit full details of the proposed transaction to the community redevelopment agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area. The amount of the subsidy will be fixed and the funds will be released to coincide as nearly as possible to the effective date of the closing of the loan. Escrow accounts may be established in conjunction with the city attorney as needed. 
(l)  The loan documents shall include, but not be limited to, documents to be filed of record which protect the lienhold interests of the community redevelopment agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area and shall provide that the city attorney must be notified should the real property which is the subject of the loan be sold, transferred, assigned or encumbered in any way and that all such actions are subject to approval by the community redevelopment agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area after seeking advice and counsel from the city attorney. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a recipient of a loan subsidy, who enters an agreement to implement the subsidy after November 1, 2010, receives financing from a commercial bank or other financial institution of a similar nature that is chartered under either federal or Florida law (but not private loan funding of any nature); the position of the public funds guarantees may be placed in a secondary position to the position of the bank/financial institution. 
(m)  In the event that an owner of property which would be otherwise eligible for loan subsidy funding has engaged in or entered financing in a manner which the city determines is not conducive to a loan subsidy being granted by the city, the city may enter grant agreements with such property owners provided that the city is attaining substantially or more of the same economic and other benefits that is substantially the same or greater than that the city would enjoy under a loan subsidy award. Such grants may be awarded under conditions that address the unique nature of the financial arrangement within which context the property is held while substantially addressing legal requirements, benefits to the city and protections afforded the city as set forth in this article. 
(n)  The following criteria will be used in evaluating applications for loan subsidies or for grants: 
(1)  Businesses that due to their success will attract other businesses to the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area shall be encouraged to apply and participate. 
(2)  Renovation projects that will spur additional development and private investment shall be encouraged to apply and participate. 
(3)  Renovation projects that will attract desirable new businesses and create an effective merchandise mix shall be encouraged to apply and participate. 
(4)  Renovation projects that will have a substantial positive visual and aesthetic impact to the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area shall be encouraged to apply and participate. 
(5)  Renovation projects that will result in filling vacant retail space shall be encouraged to apply and participate.

(7)  Renovation projects that will increase employment opportunities within the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area shall be encouraged to apply and participate. 
(8)  Renovation projects that work in favorable concert with other major developments by providing enhanced activities for the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area shall be encouraged to apply and participate.

Note-   1  A financial institution whose primary roles are to accept and safeguard monetary deposits from individuals and organizations, and to lend money out. The details vary from country to country, but usually a chartered bank in operation has obtained government permission on some level to do business in the banking sector. 
Note-   2  An example of the program follows: A building owner needs to rehabilitate a structure located within the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area at a cost of $150,000. A market rate loan is currently available at 6.5% amortized for 20 years. A 1%, 20-year loan of $150,000 will require a monthly loan payment of $690.00. That payment will support a market rate loan at 6.5% of $92,550. The City Community Redevelopment Agency of the Sanford Lake Monroe Waterfront and Downtown Sanford Community Redevelopment Area will provide a 0% deferred payment loan of $57,450 into an escrow account. This loan will decline at the rate of 1/120th for each month over the 10-year period, as long as the borrower continues to own and maintain the property. At the end of 10 years the loan is forgiven and no payback is required by the borrower. Should the borrower sell or transfer title, in any manner or degree, to the property during the lien term the agency would receive the remaining balance of the loan based upon the length of time the borrower has met the conditions for loan.

Sec. 10-35. - Findings. 
    Based on evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the city commission and on the findings incorporated in the United States Attorney General Commission on Pornography (1986), Jacksonville Ordinance Code, chapter 410, Ord. 77-257-256, section 1, the Los Angeles Municipal Code, section 12.70, Ord. 156509 (1982), the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, 66,0000, Ord. 742-G, section 1, 10-24-1972, and "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984, and the findings of fact set out in section 3-5 of the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange County, Florida, a county in Central Florida, and evidence and affidavits presented by the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation of the Ninth Judicial Circuit of Florida, the city commission hereby finds: 
(1)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia, which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(2)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas, or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(3)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur at establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the health, safety, economy, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere. 
(4)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are present in establishments, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(5)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are competitively exploited in establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection (4) of this section, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(6)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur often are constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior signs or appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(7)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(8)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
(9)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment. 
(10)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur. 
(11)  Employees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(12)  Physical contact or touching within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur between employees exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(13)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur. 
(14)  The potential dangers to the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(15)  Requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur to keep a list of information concerning current employees and certain recent past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(16)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(17)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in establishments at which the activities described in subsection (1) and (2) of this section occur have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and pose a threat to the health of the participants and promote the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.

1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration or topography of the site render the elevation standards of Section 1612 inappropriate. 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable. 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances. 
4.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard. 
5.  Submission to the applicant of written notice specifying the difference between the design flood elevation to which the building is to be built, stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation, and stating that construction below the design flood elevation increases risks to live and property.

Permit application forms shall comply with the requirements of Section 713.135(5) and (6), Florida Statutes. Each application shall be inscribed with the date of application, and the code in effect as of that date. For a building permit for which an application is submitted prior to the effective date of the Florida Building Code, the state minimum building code in effect in the city on the date of the application governs the permitted work for the life of the permit and any extension granted to the permit. 
    105.3.1. Action on application. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws, the building official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the building official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Code and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit therefore as soon as practicable. When authorized through contractual agreement with a school board, in acting on applications for permits, the building official shall give first priority to any applications for the construction of, or addition or renovation to, any school or educational facility. 
    105.3.1.1.

    105.3.1.2. No permit may be issued for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair, or addition unless the applicant for such permit provides to the enforcing agency which issues the permit any of the following documents which apply to the construction for which the permit is to be issued and which shall be prepared by or under the direction of an engineer registered under Chapter 471, Florida Statutes: 
1.  Plumbing documents for any new building or addition which requires a plumbing system with more than 250 fixture units or which costs more than $125,000. 
2.  Fire sprinkler documents for any new building or addition which includes a fire sprinkler system which contains 50 or more sprinkler heads. A Contractor I, Contractor II, or Contractor IV, certified under Section 633 Florida Statutes, may design a fire sprinkler system of 49 or fewer heads and may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation, addition or deletion of not more than 49 heads, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system. 
3.  Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning documents for any new building or addition which requires more than a 15-ton-per-system capacity which is designed to accommodate 100 or more persons or for which the system costs more than $125,000. This paragraph does not include any document for the replacement or repair of an existing system in which the work does not require altering the structural part of the building or for work on a residential one-, two-, three- or four-family structure. 
An air-conditioning system may be designed by an installing air-conditioning contractor certified under Chapter 489, Florida Statutes, to serve any building or addition which is designed to accommodate fewer than 100 persons and requires an air-conditioning system with a value of $125,000 or less; and when a 15-ton-per-system or less is designed for a singular space of a building and each 15-ton system or less has an independent duct system. Systems not complying with the above require design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer. 
Example 1: When a space has two 10-ton systems, with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design these two systems since each unit (system) is less than 15 tons. 
Example 2: Consider a small single-story office building which consists of six individual offices where each office has a single three-ton package air-conditioning heat pump. The six heat pumps are connected to a single water cooling tower. The cost of the entire heating, ventilation and air-conditioning work is $47,000 and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons. Because the six mechanical units are connected to a common water tower, this is considered to be an 18-ton system. It therefore could not be designed by a mechanical or air conditioning contractor. 
NOTE: It was further clarified by the Commission that the limiting criteria of 100 persons and $125,000 apply to the building occupancy load and the cost for the total air-conditioning system of the building. 
4.  Any specialized mechanical, electrical, or plumbing document for any new building or addition which includes a medical gas, oxygen, steam, vacuum, toxic air filtration, halon, or fire detection and alarm system which costs more than $5,000. 
5.  Electrical documents. Any electrical system with a value of more than $125,000 and requires an aggregate service capacity of more than 600 amperes (240 volts) on a residential electrical system or of more than 800 amperes (240 volts) on a commercial or industrial electrical system. Documents requiring an engineer seal by this part shall not be valid unless a professional engineer who possesses a valid certificate of registration has signed, dated, and stamped such document as provided in Section 471.025, Florida Statutes. 
6.  All public swimming pools and public bathing places defined by and regulated under Chapter 514, Florida Statutes. 
    105.3.2. Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned and shall be, as a matter of law, null and void 180 days after the date of filing, unless such application has been pursued in good faith or a permit has been issued; except that the building official is authorized to grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing prior to the abandonment date and justifiable cause demonstrated. 
    105.3.3. An enforcing authority may not issue a building permit for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the permit either includes on its face or there is attached to the permit the following statement: "NOTICE: In addition to the requirements of this permit, there may be additional restrictions applicable to this property that may be found in the public records of this county, and there may be additional permits required from other governmental entities such as water management districts, state agencies, or federal agencies." 
    105.3.4. A building permit for a single-family residential dwelling must be issued within 30 working days of application therefor unless unusual circumstances require a longer time for processing the application or unless the permit application fails to satisfy the Florida Building Code or the enforcing agency's laws or ordinances. 
    105.3.5. Identification of minimum premium policy. Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, Workers' Compensation, every employer shall, as a condition to receiving a building permit, show proof that it has secured compensation for its employees as provided in Section 440.10 and 440.38, Florida Statutes. In accordance with Section 489.113(4)(c) Florida Statutes, the local government may also deny issuance of, or may suspend, any outstanding building permit where a contractor fails or refuses to provide proof of public liability and property damage insurance coverage as required by Section 489.115(5) Florida Statutes and workers' compensation insurance coverage as required by Section 489.114 Florida Statutes. 
    105.3.6. Asbestos removal. Moving, removal or disposal of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where the owner occupies the building, the building is not for sale or lease, and the work is performed according to the owner-builder limitations provided in this paragraph. To qualify for exemption under this paragraph, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application. The permitting agency shall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form: 
Disclosure Statement: State law requires asbestos abatement to be done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on your property. If you sell or lease such building within 1 year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. 
    105.3.7. Applicable code for manufactured buildings. Manufacturers should be permitted to complete all buildings designed and approved prior to the effective date of a new code edition, provided a clear signed contract is in place. The contract shall provide specific data mirroring that required by an application for permit, specifically, without limitation, date of execution, building owner or dealer, and anticipated date of completion. However, the construction activity must commence within 6 months of the contract's execution. The contract is subject to verification by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. 
    105.3.8. Public right of way. A permit shall not be given by a building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has received a right of way permit from the city or other authority having jurisdiction over the street, alley or public lane. Any construction encroaching into a public right of way shall be compliant with Chapter 32 of this Code. 
    105.4. Conditions of the permit. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this Code or of any other ordinance of the city. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or other ordinances of the City shall not be valid. The issuance of a permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the building official from requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. The building official is also authorized to prevent occupancy or use of a structure where in violation of this Code or of any other ordinances of the city. 
    105.4.1. Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of this Code. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. 
    105.4.1.1. If work has commenced and the permit is revoked, becomes null and void, or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, a new permit covering the proposed construction shall be obtained before proceeding with the work. 
    105.4.1.2. If a new permit is not obtained within 180 days from the date the initial permit became null and void, the building official is authorized to require that any work which has been commenced or completed be removed from the building site. Alternately, a new permit may be issued on application, providing the work in place and required to complete the structure meets all applicable regulations in effect at the time the initial permit became null and void and any regulations which may have become effective between the date of expiration and the date of issuance of the new permit. 
    105.4.1.3. Work shall be considered to be in active progress when the permit has received an approved inspection within 180 days. This provision shall not be applicable in case of civil commotion or strike or when the building work is halted due directly to judicial injunction, order or similar process. 
    105.4.1.4. The fee for renewal reissuance and extension of a permit shall be set forth by the administrative authority. 
    105.5. Expiration. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work on the site authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized on the site by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced. Failure to obtain an approved inspection within 180 days of the previous approved inspection shall constitute suspension or abandonment. The building official is authorized to grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing prior to the expiration date and justifiable cause demonstrated. Permits issued for the demolition of a structure shall expire 30 days from the date of issuance. For a justifiable cause, one extension of time for a period not exceeding 30 days may be allowed. Such request shall be in writing to the building official.

    This article may be cited as the "Sanford Newsrack Code." 
(Code 1973, § 22-14; Ord. No. 3478, § 1, 6-14-1999) 
Sec. 22-62. - Intent and purpose. 
    The city commission finds and declares that: 
(1)  Findings. 
a.  The uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in the city presents an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of the general public, including pedestrians, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, and persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services. 
b.  Newsracks so located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons, and unsightly newsracks, constitute public nuisances. 
c.  It is a matter of public necessity that the city protect children and unconsenting adults in and on its public streets, sidewalks, transportation facilities and other public rights-of-way and private property from viewing public displays of offensive sexual material. Such displays are thrust indiscriminately upon unwilling audiences of adults and children and constitute assaults upon individual privacy. 
d.  These factors constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of public rights-of-way and private property, constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, are injurious to health, are offensive to the senses, and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community. 
e.  The city commission recognizes, however, that the use of public rights-of-way is so historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The city commission further finds that these strong and competing interests require a reasonable accommodation which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this article, which is designed to accommodate such interests regulating the time, place and manner of using such newsracks. 
(2)  Purpose. The provisions and prohibitions contained and enacted in this article are in pursuance of and for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, morals, and general welfare of persons in the city in their use of public rights-of-way and private property through the regulation of placement, appearance, number, size, and servicing of newsracks in the city so as to: 
a.  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience; 
b.  Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including ingress to, or egress from, any place of business or from the street to the sidewalk; 
c.  Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs and signals, hydrants, mailboxes, and similar appurtenances, and access to locations used for public transportation purposes; 
d.  Reduce visual blight in the city, protect the aesthetics and value of surrounding properties, and protect the quiet of residential areas; 
e.  Reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation; and 
f.  Protect the right to distribute information protected by the United States and Florida constitutions through use of newsracks. 
(3)  Preservation of constitutional rights. It is not the intent of this article to in any way discriminate against, regulate, or interfere with the publication, circulation, distribution, or dissemination of any printed material that is constitutionally protected.

(s)  If notice has been provided to the violator of the public hearing pursuant to this part of this article (which shall be as required by F.S. ch. 162), the hearing may be conducted and an order rendered in the absence of the alleged violator. 
(t)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer/special magistrate shall issue an order setting forth findings of fact, based on evidence of record, and issue conclusions of law, and shall render relief in the order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this part of this article. A written order shall be issued within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the hearing. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by that date. A second hearing shall be scheduled by the city at which the hearing officer/special master shall determine when compliance has been attained in accordance with controlling legal precedent. An aggrieved party, including the city, may appeal a final administrative order of the hearing officer/special magistrate to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the hearing officer/special magistrate. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
(u)  A certified copy of an order imposing the fine provided for herein may be recorded in the public records of Seminole County or any other county, and thereafter such order shall constitute a lien against the property on which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land involved in the violation, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator and may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state including levy against personal property, but shall not be deemed otherwise to be a judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. 
(v)  When an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this part of this article and the order is complied with by the dates specified in the order, the hearing officer/special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required if such is an order acknowledging compliance prior to the date set for compliance; provided, however, that the alleged violator shall have the right to request a hearing to determine when compliance has been attained. 
(w)  A fine imposed pursuant to this part of this article shall not exceed $1,000.00 per day per violation for a first violation, shall not exceed $5,000.00 per day per violation for a repeat violation and up to $15,000.00 per violation if the special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature. In formulating the provisions of the order, the hearing officer/special magistrate should be consistent in the imposition of fines, paying special attention to the gravity of the violation, any actions and the timeliness of actions taken by a violator to correct the violation and any previous violations committed by the violator. The hearing officer/special magistrate shall include in the order establishing a fine that the violator shall pay all costs of the proceedings incurred by the city. 2 [] 
(x)  The fine imposed pursuant to this part of this article by the hearing officer/special magistrate shall be final and may be appealed only to the circuit court in accordance with the controlling provisions of law. The violator may make arrangements through the city manager to pay the fine in monthly payments; provided, however, if the violator fails to timely perform under the agreement, the city shall have and maintain all enforcement rights relative to the fine imposed as reduced by payments that have been made. 
(y)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of Seminole County or any other county and, therefore, shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part of this article shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the mayor and the city commission may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. 
(z)  Notwithstanding the processes set forth relative to presentation of matters before the special magistrate, the city may negotiate a stipulated order prior to a hearing and submit the order to the special magistrate for his or her execution. 
(aa)  Costs of the proceedings, as used in this section, means all costs incurred by or on behalf of the city from the first discovery of a code or ordinance violation through the appeal process and until compliance is achieved including, but not limited to, staff time in investigating the violation, inspecting the property where the violation occurred, preparing investigation reports, issuing and distributing notices, preparing for and attending any appeal hearing, and fees paid to the special magistrate. 
(bb)  Notwithstanding any provision in this part of this article to the contrary, the city shall adhere to the procedures set forth in the Local Government Code Enforcement Boards Act in conducting its code enforcement activities.

(b)  The administrative citation process may be used to enforce any code or ordinance of the city as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(c)  In the course of providing notice to violators under the provisions of F.S. ch. 162, pt. I, the city shall cause an administrative citation to be issued to the violator and the violator shall be notified of a date and time in which the cited violation must be remedied and, if not remedied, the fine for each day, or a total amount of the fine, that will be assessed should the violator not remedy the violation within the time prescribed and not elect to proceed to the hearing officer/special magistrate process. 
(d)  In any case where an administrative citation is issued, service of the citation shall be made by complying with the following: 
(1)  The code enforcement officer, or other authorized officer, shall attempt to locate and personally serve the responsible person and obtain the signature of the responsible person on the administrative citation. If the responsible person refuses or fails to sign the administrative citation, the refusal to sign shall not affect the validity of the administrative citation or of subsequent proceedings; or 
(2)  The responsible person shall be served by certified mail, return receipt requested or overnight delivery while simultaneously, the administrative citation shall be mailed by first class mail with delivery certification. If the administrative citation is sent by certified mail and returned unsigned, then service shall be deemed effective pursuant to first class mail, provided the administrative citation sent by first class mail is not returned. 
(e)  The fines assessed under this article shall be in accordance with the following amounts: 
(1)  A fine in the amount of $100.00 for the first administrative citation; 
(2)  A fine in the amount of $200.00 for a second administrative citation for violation of the same code or ordinance if issued within a 12-month period; 
(3)  A fine in the amount of $500.00 for any subsequent administrative citation issued for violation of the same code or ordinance within a 12-month period. 
(f)  The forms relating to the implementation of this Ordinance, the city's hearing officer/special magistrate process implementing the provisions of F.S. ch. 162, pt. I, 1 [] and any other code enforcement process may be combined; provided, however, that each administrative citation shall contain the following information: 
(1)  The date, approximate time and address of definite description of the location where the violation(s) was/were observed; 
(2)  The code section(s)/ordinance number(s) violated and a description of the violation(s); 
(3)  The amount of fine for the violation(s);

Failure to issue the notice to correct and/or explanation of consequences for failure to correct violations shall not affect the validity of the administrative citation or of subsequent proceedings. 
(g)  Upon receipt of a citation, the responsible person must remedy the violation within the time prescribed in the citation, and if not remedied within the prescribed time, either pay the fine to the city within 15 days from the issue date of the administrative citation; or, within said time period, file a request for hearing. Upon the filing of a request for hearing, the city will proceed with a hearing on the matter in accordance with the provisions of sections 26-31 through 26-36 or a process which solely addresses the violation cited not under the processes and procedures established in F.S. ch. 162, and determines only whether the fine established in subsection 26-101(e) should be imposed. Any recipient of an administrative citation may contest the citation by completing a request for hearing form and returning it to the designated city office within 15 days from the date the administrative citation is served or deemed to have been served. A failure to file a timely request for hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing on the administrative citation and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies; provided, however, that the city may proceed with other code enforcement remedies in its discretion. 
(h)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if a citizen or other person files a complaint with the city alleging a code or ordinance violation and the city notifies the owner of the property on which the violation is alleged to occur of the allegation and, after such notice an investigation is conducted by the city which results in a determination that the allegation was well founded and the violation was not cured after notice, the city may assess an investigative fee in such amount as may be established by resolution of the city commission.

Sections 26-31 through 26-36 of the City Code. 

Sec. 26-102. - Appeals. 
(a)  The City Commission of the City of Sanford hereby finds that not all of the City's Codes and ordinances provide for administrative appeals with regard to permit issuance or denial or other similar actions of the city. 
(b)  In such cases when a specific permitting activity or process of the city, or other activity of the city such as, but not limited to, the payment of utility bills, does not provide for an appellate process when a permit is denied, or a city action is taken, and an applicant or other person affected by the action of the city would be in violation of a City Code or ordinance to conduct the activity without the issuance of a permit or would otherwise be in noncompliance with the requirements of the city, the applicant for the permit, or the person adversely affected by the action of the city, may appeal the denial or other action to the city manager or, if the city manager is the official vested with the initial power to grant a permit or take an action, to the city commission. Appeals must be filed within ten city working days from the date of the denial, or action of the city, and must specifically state in writing and in detail the basis of the appeal. Engaging in unpermitted activity while a permit has been denied is prohibited and unlawful notwithstanding the fact that an appeal may have been filed and be pending and the payment of any sum due must be timely made in order for the matter to be heard and this appeal process shall not be used for the purposes of delaying payment. Actions taken by the city in its code enforcement processes shall not be subject to appeal under the provisions of this section. The city commission shall establish an appeal fee relative to this section by adoption of a resolution. 
(Ord. No. 4153, § 3, 3-23-2009; Ord. No. 4207, § 6, 4-26-2010) 
Sec. 26-103. - Hearing officers. 
(a)  The City Commission of the City of Sanford hereby finds that from time-to-time it is beneficial and desirable for various matters, arising from the provisions of the city's Codes and ordinances, to be referred to hearing officers to make findings of facts and conclusions of law; to hear administrative appeals; or to hear other matters of a similar nature. 
(b)  A hearing officer means a person whom the city commission authorizes to conduct appeals or other administrative hearings. Hearing officers must be members of the Florida Bar in good standing and have adequate experience or knowledge in the area of the matters over which they will preside. The employment, performance evaluation, compensation and benefits of a hearing officer shall not be directly or indirectly conditioned upon the amount of penalties or administrative costs upheld, awarded, imposed, or assessed by the hearing officer. Hearing officers shall have all powers necessary to conduct fair and impartial hearings including, but not limited to, the power to hold conferences for settlement or simplification of the issues; administer oaths and affirmations; hear testimony; rule upon motions, objections, and the admissibility of evidence; preserve and authenticate the record of the hearing and all exhibits and evidence introduced at a hearing; regulate the course of the hearing in accordance with this chapter or other applicable law; issue orders which include findings of fact and conclusions of law and make recommendations, determinations, decisions, or any combination thereof. 
(c)  The city commission or city manager may determine that matters will be referred to hearing officers for a determination, a decision, a recommendation, or findings of facts and conclusions of law, or any combination thereof, by providing for same in the provisions of an ordinance enacted or a resolution adopted by the city commission or a letter of assignment by the city manager. 
(d)  The rules of procedure relating to a matter referred to a hearing officer shall be set forth in the ordinance, resolution or letter of assignment providing for the involvement of hearing officers; provided, however, that in the absence of such rules of procedure, hearing officers shall conduct proceedings in accordance with the following: 
(1)  After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer may immediately issue a verbal decision or may issue a written decision within ten working days of the hearing. The decision shall include any conditions pertaining to the matter as may be appropriate. 
(2)  If a verbal decision is issued at the hearing, a written decision shall be prepared by the hearing officer and mailed to the parties within ten working days. 
(3)  The effective date of the decision shall be the date that the written decision is filed in the office of the city clerk. 
(4)  The case for the city shall be presented by the city attorney or designee. 
(5)  The case for the respondent may be presented by the respondent or attorney for the respondent. An attorney shall present a written appearance form signed by the respondent under penalty of perjury indicating that such attorney is authorized to act and to bind the respondent to any orders entered by the hearing officer. 
(6)  The hearing officer shall conduct the hearings in an orderly manner and insist upon proper decorum by all persons present at the hearings. The intent of the hearings is to provide the city and the respondent a full and fair presentation of the issues. 
(7)  The strict laws of evidence shall not apply. Hearings are intended to be informal in nature. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply, except that findings shall not be based solely on hearsay evidence. Other than responses to public records requests and the distribution of copies of citations, notices, orders, and inspection reports served on the responsible parties, or other similar materials as may be appropriate as part of the matter giving rise to the hearing, no pre-hearing discovery shall be permitted. 
(8)  Hearsay testimony may be admitted and relied upon by the hearing officer in making a determination. 
(9)  Relevant documents may be received into evidence without formal proof of authenticity. The hearing officer shall determine the weight, if any, to be afforded documents received into evidence. 
(10)  Either party may request that the proceedings be taken and transcribed by a certified court reporter. 
(11)  All hearings shall be conducted on the date set for hearing; provided, however, that for good cause shown, a postponement may be granted in the discretion of the hearing officer, or the office of the city attorney may stipulate to a continuance. The purpose of hearings is to provide prompt resolution of matters and, accordingly, the request for and the grant of continuances shall be limited to the extent fairness permits. 
(12)  The city bears the burden of proof at hearings unless a code, ordinance or resolution states otherwise. 
(13)  The standard of proof to be used by hearing officers in deciding the issues at a hearing is the preponderance of the evidence unless a code, ordinance or resolution states otherwise. 
(14)  Each party shall have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and present relevant evidence in support of that party's case. 
(15)  The hearing officer shall issue orders, including final orders, in accordance with the controlling code, ordinance or resolution. 
(e)  A hearing officer is subject to disqualification for bias, prejudice, interest, or for any other reason for which a judge may be disqualified in a Florida court of law.

(a)  A special assessment district is hereby established within the city limits of the City of Sanford to provide that special assessments may be assessed against real property that is maintained by the city under the provisions of the codes and ordinances of the city if the owner of real property fails to maintain real property as required in this Code.

The resolution shall be presented to the city commission by the city manager and, upon approval of the resolution by the city commission, the costs stated in the resolution shall be and constitute a municipal special assessment against the real property and shall be and remain a lien against the real property with priority over all other liens, save and except taxes. The assessment shall be payable at the time and in the manner as stated in such resolution. If not paid, a municipal special assessment lien document relating specifically to the property shall be recorded in addition to the recording of the resolution. 
(e)  Upon completion of the maintenance or nuisance abatement activities and the approval of the special assessment resolution by the city commission, the city manager shall cause to be published a notice directed to the property owners of the real property benefited by the city's maintenance or nuisance abatement activities which notice designates a time and place where complaints will be heard with reference to such special assessments and when such special assessments will be finally approved and confirmed by the city commission. A copy of such notice shall be served upon such real property owners affected thereby, which shall be served by mailing, by certified or registered mail, a copy of such notice to each of such property owners at the owner's last known address as same appear on the records of the Seminole County Property Appraiser. 
(f)  At the time and place designated in the notice provided in subsection (e), the city commission shall meet as an equalizing board to hear and consider any and all complaints as to such special assessments and shall adjust and equalize the special assessments, and when so equalized and approved, such special assessments shall stand confirmed and be and remain legal, valid and binding liens upon the real property against which such special assessments are made until paid. If a modification of a special assessment occurs, a revised resolution and municipal special assessment lien shall be recorded detailing such modification.

ARTICLE II. - COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN RIGHT-OF-WAY 

Sec. 30-31. - Title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Sanford Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance." 
(Code 1973, § 61/2-101; Ord. No. 3656, § 1, 7-9-2001) 
Sec. 30-32. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including F.S. § 337.401, the city's home rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(Code 1973, § 61/2-102; Ord. No. 3656, § 2, 7-9-2001) 
Sec. 30-33. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and the word "may" is permissive. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary meaning. 
    Abandonment means the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility, provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. By way of example and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be abandonment of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
    Communications facility, facility and system mean any permanent or temporary plant, equipment and property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennas, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathways placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the city and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
    Communications services means the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service," as defined in F.S. § 202.11(2), is not included in the definition of "communications services," and cable service providers may be subject to other ordinances of the city. 
    Communications services provider means any person, including a municipality or county, providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. "Communications services provider" shall also include any person, including a municipality or county, that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
    FCC means the Federal Communications Commission. 
    In public rights-of-way and in the public rights-of-way mean in, on, over, under or across the public rights-of-way. 
    Person includes any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include the city only to the extent the city acts as a communication services provider. 
    Place or maintain and placement or maintenance and placing or maintaining mean to erect, construct, install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A person providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
    Public rights-of-way means a public right-of-way, public utility easement, highway, street, bridge, tunnel or alley for which the city is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the airspace over the surface and the area below the surface. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described in this definition and shall not include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. 
    Registrant means a communications services provider that has registered with the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
    Registration and register mean the process described in this article whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the city. 
(Code 1973, § 61/2-103; Ord. No. 3656, § 3, 7-9-2001) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 30-34. - Registration of communications services providers. 
(a)  Required. A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  Limitations; compliance with applicable regulations. A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(c)  Required information. Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration, and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that the registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; and 
(5)  The number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the state public service commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any; and 
(6)  For an applicant that does not provide a state public service commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department of State. 
(d)  Application fee. 
(1)  The city, at its option, may require a registration application fee through October 1, 2001. If the city decides to charge such fee, note that some telecommunications services providers may offset this registration application fee against fees payable to a municipality under F.S. § 337.401(3), so the city may choose not to require a separate registration application fee from such providers. Under the provisions of Laws of Fla. ch. 2000-260, §§ 16 and 51, effective October 1, 2001, registration application fees do not appear to be permitted. 
(2)  Each applicant for a registration shall submit a registration application fee with the application, which shall not be refunded if the application is withdrawn; provided that the registrant may credit the registration application fee as provided in F.S. § 337.401(3). Fee amounts shall be established by resolution of the city and shall be in an amount not to exceed the city's costs and expenses incurred in connection with reviewing and approving the registration. If the registration application fee is insufficient to cover all costs or expenses incurred by the city in connection with review and approval of the registration, the applicant shall reimburse the city for any such costs and expenses in excess of the registration application fee following receipt of written notice, which shall explain any additional costs or expenses. This subsection shall be repealed and shall have no force or effect on or after October 1, 2001; no registration application fees shall be imposed on or after October 1, 2001. 
(e)  Review of information; notification of non-effectiveness. The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the designated city official or his designee. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has 30 days after receipt of a notice of non-effectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 30-38. 
(f)  Cancellation of registration. A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(g)  Effect of registration. Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(h)  Renewal of registration. A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even-numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even-numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd-numbered year immediately preceding such even-numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even-numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3), a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(i)  Permit. In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit may be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(Code 1973, § 61/2-104; Ord. No. 3656, § 4, 7-9-2001) 
Sec. 30-35. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in right-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within 20 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 30-34 within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. 
(Code 1973, § 61/2-105; Ord. No. 3656, § 5, 7-9-2001) 
Sec. 30-36. - Standards for placement and maintenance of facilities. 
(a)  Generally. A registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state and federal law and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  Permit requirements. A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrants shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall or may be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. The registrant acknowledges that, as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. 
(c)  Required information. As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
(1)  The location of the proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where the facilities are to be located, and the approximate size of facilities that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e., anticipated construction methods or techniques); 
(3)  A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(4)  Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness to the extent obtained from other persons); 
(5)  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration of the public rights-of-way; 
(6)  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city which will be affected; and 
(7)  Such additional information as the city finds reasonably necessary with respect to the placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit application to review such permit application. 
(d)  Power of city to prohibit or limit placement. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way. 
(e)  Interference with rights of public and adjoining property owners. All communications facilities shall be placed or maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the collocation of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. 
(f)  Safety requirements. All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(g)  Restoration of right-of-way. After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public right-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402. For 12 months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this article at its own expense. 
(h)  Removal or relocation. Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404. 
(i)  Rights granted by permit. A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j)  Maintenance. A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k)  Protection of underground facilities. In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556. 
(l)  Performance of work. The registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(m)  Coordination with other activities. Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced in subsection (n) of this section, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way, and the registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(n)  Interference with other facilities. A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(o)  Limitations. The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way, and city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communication facilities. 
(p)  Inspections. The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public right-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(q)  Submission of plans. A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format or an electronic format specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. 
(r)  Rights reserved by city. The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do and to permit to be done any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within such limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(s)  Temporary raising or lowering of facilities. The registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than 30 days' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
(t)  Wireless facilities attached to vertical structure. A wireless facility that is a portion of a communication facility, such as an antenna ("wireless facility"), which is attached to a legally maintained vertical structure in the public rights-of-way, such as a light pole or utility pole ("vertical structure"), shall be subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Wireless facilities may not extend more than 20 feet above the highest point of the vertical structure; 
(2)  Wireless facilities that are attached to a vertical structure located in public rights-of-way that is 15 feet or less in width and is located adjacent to real property used as a single-family residence shall be flush mounted to the vertical structure; 
(3)  Wireless facilities shall not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or illuminations unless required by an applicable federal, state, or local rule, regulation or law; 
(4)  Wireless facilities shall comply with any applicable Federal Communications Commission emissions standards; 
(5)  The design, construction, and installation of such wireless facilities shall comply with any applicable local building codes; 
(6)  No commercial advertising shall be allowed on such wireless facilities; and 
(7)  Any accessory equipment and related housing in the public rights-of-way that are used in conjunction with such a wireless facility shall comply with any applicable local rules, regulations, ordinances, or laws governing the placement and design of such equipment. Vertical structures, such as towers, whose sole purpose is to serve as a mounting device for antennas, are expressly prohibited from being placed in the public rights-of-way unless applicable zoning and land use laws or regulations allow such structures to be placed within the zoning district in which such public rights-of-way are located or to which they are adjacent.

Sec. 30-38. - Appeals. 
    Final, written decisions of the city official or his designee suspending or denying a permit, denying an application for a registration or denying an application for renewal of a registration are subject to appeal.

Sec. 30-39. - Involuntary termination of registration. 
(a)  The city may terminate a registration if: 
(1)  A federal or state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification or license to provide communications services; 
(2)  The registrant's placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way presents an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the public rights-of-way and the registrant fails to remedy the danger promptly after receipt of written notice; or 
(3)  The registrant ceases to use all of its communications facilities in public rights-of-way and has not complied with section 30-46. 
(b)  Prior to termination, the registrant shall be notified by the city official with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to the proposed termination action, including which of subsections (a)(1) through (3) of this section is applicable as the reason therefor, and describing the proposed action of the city with respect thereto. The registrant shall have 60 days after receipt of such notice within which to address or eliminate the reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the city official, to accomplish the same. If the plan is rejected, the city official shall provide written notice of such rejection to the registrant and shall make a recommendation to the city commission regarding a decision as to termination of registration. A decision by a city to terminate a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the city commission. A registrant shall be notified by written notice of any decision by the city commission to terminate its registration. Such written notice shall be sent within seven days after the decision. 
(c)  In the event of termination, the former registrant shall: (i) notify the city of the assumption or anticipated assumption by another registrant of ownership of the registrant's communications facilities in public rights-of-way; or (ii) provide the city with an acceptable plan for disposition of its communications facilities in public rights-of-way. If a registrant fails to comply with this subsection (c), which determination of noncompliance is subject to appeal as provided in section 30-38, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limited to taking possession of the facilities where another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the facilities or requiring the registrant within 90 days of the termination, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the registrant, to remove some or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public right-of-way to its original condition before the removal. 
(d)  In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(e)  In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not authorize the city to cause the removal of communications facilities used to provide another service for which the registrant or another person who owns or exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or license with the governing federal or state agency, if required for provision of such service, and is registered with the city, if required.

Sec. 30-40. - Existing facilities in right-of-way. 
    A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the city has 60 days from the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived to comply with the terms of this article, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation thereof.

This provision includes, but is not limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings. The city agrees to notify the registrant, in writing, within a reasonable time of the city receiving notice, of any issue it determines may require indemnification.

ARTICLE III. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN RIGHT-OF-WAY 

Sec. 30-71. - Purpose; applicability. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to establish fees for occupation of the city's rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities of telecommunications companies not otherwise paying a fee to the city for occupation of the city's rights-of-way. Any telecommunications company paying fees for the occupation of the city's rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall continue to pay fees to the city as the company has been paying them. 
(b)  The fees imposed pursuant to this article shall apply to all telecommunications companies occupying the city's rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities and not otherwise paying a fee to the city for occupation of the city's rights-of-way. 
(c)  The fees imposed pursuant to this article are a fee and not a tax as specified in F.S. § 337.401, consequently: 
(1)  The payments to be made pursuant to this article shall not be deemed to be in the nature of a tax; 
(2)  Such payments shall be in addition to any and all taxes of a general applicability; and 
(3)  The fee specified in this article is consideration for occupation of the city's rights-of-way, including all public easements, for the purpose of erecting, constructing and maintaining telecommunications systems. 
(Code 1973, § 61/2-151; Ord. No. 3611, § 1, 1-22-2001) 
Sec. 30-72. - Fee for occupation of right-of-way. 
(a)  Any telecommunications company providing local telephone service, as defined in F.S. § 203.012(3), in the city and that is occupying municipal streets or rights-of-way within the corporate limits of the city with poles, wires or other fixtures shall pay to the city a fee in the amount of one percent of the gross receipts on recurring local service revenues for services provided within the corporate limits of the city by such telecommunications company. Included within the fee are all taxes, licenses, fees, in-kind contributions accepted pursuant to F.S. § 337.401 and other impositions except ad valorem taxes and amounts for assessments for special benefits, such as sidewalks, street pavings, and similar improvements, and local business taxes levied or imposed by the city upon the telecommunications company. 
(1)  If a telecommunications company which provides telecommunications services defined as toll services in F.S. § 203.012(7) occupies the city's rights-of-way, the telecommunications company shall pay to the city annually $500.00 per linear mile, which amount is prorated for any portion thereof, for any cable, fiber optic, or other pathway that makes physical use of the city's rights-of-way. Such annual fee shall be prorated to reflect the expiration date of this article and shall be payable annually, in advance. If a telecommunications company that is required to pay a fee pursuant to this subsection (1) increases the amount of its facilities occupying the city's rights-of-way after such advance payment has been made, but prior to the expiration date of this article, the fees due for the additional facilities shall be prorated and paid in full at the time the facilities are installed in the city's rights-of-way. The fee or other consideration imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not apply in any manner to any telecommunications company which provides local telephone service for any services provided by such telecommunications company. 
(2)  "Telecommunications company," as used in this article, shall have the meaning set forth in F.S. § 364.02(12). 
(b)  The fees provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be paid by the telecommunications company to the city in quarterly installments. The installment payments shall be based upon such gross receipts on recurring local service revenues for the immediately preceding installment period or portion thereof after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and shall be made within 30 calendar days following the end of the period. Past due payments or underpayments shall bear interest accrued from the last day of the quarter for which the payment was due. Interest shall be paid at the Florida statutory rate of interest on judgments as established by F.S. § 55.03. Payments shall include a statement as to how the fee amount was determined and the statement shall be certified by the telecommunications company's chief financial officer or other duly authorized representative of the company. 
(c)  If the city wishes to verify the payments due to the city under this section, the telecommunications company shall permit the city or a designated representative of the city, upon reasonable advance written notice, and during normal business hours, at the location of the telecommunications company where such records are maintained in the city, at another location satisfactory to the city, or elsewhere pursuant to subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section, to review or audit the telecommunications company's billing and payment records kept in the ordinary course of business upon which the payments were based. If a telecommunications company's records are not maintained in the city, the telecommunications company shall either: 
(1)  Pay all reasonable expenses, including travel, following the provisions of F.S. § 112.061(6), (7) and (8) to the city for the city to have a review or audit performed; or 
(2)  Provide the city with access to copies of the telecommunications company's records in the city or within 55 miles of the city or by an electronic method satisfactory to the city. 
However, without the specific written consent of a telecommunications company's audit representative, no company records may be duplicated or taken from the telecommunications company's premises, and the city shall maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed in these records and use the information solely for the purposes of verifying payments by the telecommunications company. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for sums due and payable under this article unless the city agrees in writing. If the city, pursuant to final audit findings, determines that there exists a difference between the amount due to the city and the amount paid to the city, indicating an underpayment to the city, in excess of five percent of the amount due, such telecommunications company shall pay all reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the audit. 
(d)  This article is adopted consistent with the provisions of F.S. § 337.401 and other applicable provisions of law. This section shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of the power of the city to prescribe and enforce reasonable rules and regulations pursuant to applicable provisions of law. 
(e)  If required by applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a telecommunications company shall be registered with the city and obtain all permits that may be required by the city regarding occupation of the city's public rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities.

ARTICLE V. - IMPACT FEE CREDITS 

Sec. 42-17. - Requirements for impact fee credits. 
(a)  Each parcel that is subject to a fire public safety facilities impact fees may be granted a credit applied to the fire public safety facilities impact fees calculated for the buildings or structures located on the parcel based on one of the following factors: 
(1)  Parcels containing buildings equipped with a functioning and properly designed, fully automated fire suppression system with the property owner providing proof of proper operation and maintenance annually to avoid a revocation of the fire public safety facilities impact fees credit in which case a municipal lien shall be placed upon the property in the event of non-payment. 
(2)  Parcels containing buildings that are otherwise designed to be more fire resistant due to unique building construction. 
(b)  No parcel shall receive more than a 20 percent fire public safety facilities impact fees credit in terms of the impact fees assigned to the buildings or structures located on the parcel and it shall be the burden of the property owner to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that a credit should be awarded and the amount of the credit. 
(c)  Credits for fire public safety facilities impact fees may be granted to parcels whose fire flow impacts on the fire department impact fees are mitigated by a properly designed, functioning and fully automated fire suppression system or contain buildings that are otherwise designed to be more fire resistant due to unique building construction. The basis for these credits shall be as follows: 
(1)  Parcels that contain buildings and structures equipped with functioning and properly designed, fully automated fire suppression systems require less fire flow capacity to be provided by the city which may offset some of the costs which might otherwise be borne by the city. 
(2)  Inasmuch as the most recent edition of the controlling NFPA publication encourages the use of systems, methods, or devices of equivalent or superior quality, strength, fire resistance, effectiveness, durability, and safety in place of those prescribed by the standard; property owners may provide technical documentation to the city to demonstrate equivalency and the system, method, or device is approved for the intended purpose. 
(d)  The city may reduce the water supply required by the controlling NFPA publication for manual fire-fighting purposes when a structure is protected by an automatic sprinkler system that fully meets the requirements of the controlling NFPA publications. 
(e)  For any building fully or partially protected by an automatic fire suppression system other than an automatic sprinkler system, the city shall determine the minimum water supply required for fire-fighting purposes and whether the sprinkler system provides built-in fire protection, lessening the fire suppression burden and the water supply need on the fire department. A water flow test may be required or requested to verify current water main conditions with a processing service fee for fire inspectors to verify water flow of $75.00 or such other amount established in a fee resolution adopted by the city commission. 
(f)  Owners of parcels that contain buildings or structures that are designed to be more fire resistant due to unique building construction so as require less fire flow capacity from the city which may offset some of the costs which might otherwise be borne by the city. It shall be the burden of the owner to provide, by clear and convincing evidence, that the combustibility and fire resistance of the buildings or structures greatly influence the development and spread of a fire and reduces the amount of water needed to control and extinguish a fire. 
(g)  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7 [] standards and classifications into construction types shall be utilized by the city. The ISO's six construction categories are hereby adopted by the city as follows together with the Construction Classification Number is a series of numbers from 0.5 through 1.5 that are mathematical factors used in the formula to determine the total water supply requirements.

    These regulations shall be known as the floodplain management ordinance of the City of Sanford, hereinafter referred to as "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 2015-4360, § 2, 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 46-2. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 2015-4360, § 2, 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 46-3. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the national flood insurance program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, section 59.22. 
(Ord. No. 2015-4360, § 2, 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 46-4. - Coordination with the Florida Building Code.

(Ord. No. 2015-4360, § 2, 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 46-5. - Warning. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by the City of Sanford, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the federal emergency management agency, requiring the City of Sanford to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the national flood insurance program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter.

(2)  Determination by the planning and zoning commission that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

(Ord. No. 3845, § 2(b), 2-23-2004) 
Sec. 54-84. - Exceptions. 
    This division shall not apply, and no motor vehicle shall be impounded pursuant to this division, if: 
(1)  The motor vehicle was stolen at the time that it was otherwise subject to impoundment; 
(2)  The motor vehicle was operating as an on-duty common carrier at the time that it was otherwise subject to impoundment; 
(3)  The motor vehicle was owned by a motor vehicle rental agency and the motor vehicle had been rented for a term of 30 consecutive days or less, at the time it was otherwise subject to impoundment; 
(4)  A law enforcement agency has seized the motor vehicle pursuant to the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act; or 
(5)  The arresting officer determines that the impoundment of the motor vehicle would likely result in a detriment to the public in that the condition of the motor vehicle is such that the vehicle is of questionable value or determines that the condition of the motor vehicle could reasonably threaten the security of the public area at which motor vehicles are impounded. 
(Ord. No. 3845, § 2(c), 2-23-2004) 
Sec. 54-85. - Towing of vehicle; notice to owner.

The notice shall be provided by hand delivery at the time of impoundment. If the person in control of the motor vehicle at the time of impoundment is not the owner of the motor vehicle, then notice shall also be sent to the motor vehicle's registered owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 24 hours of the time of impoundment, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

Sec. 54-86. - Hearings. 
    The following procedures shall apply to the impoundment of motor vehicles as set forth in this division: 
(1)  Within five business days of receipt of the notice described in section 54-85, the person in control of the motor vehicle at the time of impoundment, or the owner, may request a preliminary hearing by delivering to the address provided in the notice a written request for a preliminary hearing. The written request must actually be received by the city within the five-day period, or the right to a preliminary hearing shall be deemed to be waived. 
(2)  Upon timely receipt of a written request for a preliminary hearing, the city shall schedule a preliminary hearing to be held within two business days following the date of receipt of the request. The person requesting the hearing shall be notified by telephone of the date, time, and location of the hearing. 
(3)  The preliminary hearing shall be held before a hearing officer designated by the city commission. The sole issue to be considered by the hearing officer will be whether the police officer has probable cause to impound the motor vehicle. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply and hearsay evidence, including any relevant police report, shall be admissible. The burden of demonstrating probable cause shall be on the city. 
(4)  If the city establishes probable cause to support the impoundment, the hearing officer shall order the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle pending a final hearing or the payment of the administrative civil penalty described in section 54-83, plus towing and associated costs, charges and expenses, if any. Alternatively, the owner may secure release of the motor vehicle by posting a cash bond (money order or certified check) in the amount of $500.00, plus towing and associated costs, charges and expenses, if any. If no probable cause is found by the hearing officer at the preliminary hearing, the motor vehicle shall be released to the owner or designee as soon as practical without the imposition of any penalty or costs, charges or expenses whatsoever.

(6)  Within ten business days of the date a motor vehicle is impounded, or within three business days of finding of probable cause following a preliminary hearing, whichever is later, the city shall notify, by certified mail, the owner of the motor vehicle of the date, time and location of a final hearing. The final hearing shall be held, unless waived by the motor vehicle owner or continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than 30 calendar days after the date of impoundment. The city shall have the burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle was used in the course of or to facilitate prostitution, lewdness, or assignation. The city shall also have the burden of proof to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the owner, including a renter if applicable, knew or should have known, after reasonable inquiry, that the motor vehicle was employed or was likely to be employed in a criminal activity. 
(7)  If, after the hearing, a finding is made that the motor vehicle is subject to impoundment as provided in this division, and that none of the exceptions set forth in section 54-84 apply, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of the motor vehicle to be liable to the city for an administrative civil penalty of $500.00 and requiring continued impoundment of the motor vehicle pending payment of the administrative civil penalty, plus towing and associated costs, charges and expenses, if any. 
(8)  If the hearing officer determines that the city did not meet its burden of proof, or that one or more of the exceptions set forth in section 54-84 apply, then the motor vehicle shall be released to the owner as soon as practical without the imposition of any penalty, costs, charges or expenses whatsoever. Any cash bond which has been posted will be returned. 
(9)  If a final hearing is not held within 30 days of the date of impoundment through no fault of the motor vehicle owner, the motor vehicle shall be released to the owner as soon as practical without the imposition of any penalty, costs, charges or expenses whatsoever. The owner shall not be entitled to release of the motor vehicle for delays in receiving notice of the final hearing, absent a showing of resulting prejudice. 
(Ord. No. 3845, § 2(e), 2-23-2004) 
Sec. 54-87. - Judicial review.

The city may charge a reasonable fee for preparation of the record in the case. 
(Ord. No. 3845, § 2(f), 2-23-2004) 
Sec. 54-88. - Return of vehicle to owner. 
    Except as provided otherwise in section 54-84, an impounded motor vehicle shall be returned to its registered owner, or a person legally entitled to possess the motor vehicle, upon payment to the city of the administrative civil penalty, plus towing and associated costs, charges and expenses, unless the motor vehicle has been sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien, as provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 3845, § 2(g), 2-23-2004) 
Sec. 54-89. - Disposition of unclaimed vehicles. 
    Any motor vehicle that is not claimed within 60 days from the date of an order of a hearing officer subjecting the owner of the motor vehicle to the administrative civil penalty shall be treated as unclaimed evidence pursuant to F.S. § 705.101(6). Such unclaimed motor vehicle shall then be disposed of by the city pursuant to F.S. § 705.105, provided that prior to final disposition unclaimed motor vehicles subject to a perfected lien shall be subject to the lienholder notice provisions of F.S. § 705.103(2).

ARTICLE III. - PANHANDLING, BEGGING AND RELATED ACTIVITIES 

Sec. 54-115. - Legislative findings/intent. 
(a)  The city commission hereby finds that any person who panhandles or otherwise demands money, gifts or donations under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity by unwanted touching, detaining, impeding or intimidation which causes fear or apprehension in another person constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. The city commission further finds that any person who intentionally blocks the passage of another person or a vehicle which requires another person to take evasive action to avoid physical contact constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. 
(b)  The city commission finds that any person who panhandles under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in public rooms or private buildings and on private developed properties by unwanted touching, detaining, impeding or intimidation which causes fear or apprehension in another person engages in acts which constitute a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. 
(c)  The city commission finds that panhandling or demanding money, gifts or donations may interfere with the safe ingress and egress of human and vehicular traffic into public buildings, public areas and public transportation areas thereby constituting a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. In order to allow for the safe ingress and egress of human and vehicular traffic into public buildings, public areas and public transportation areas, the city manager is authorized to prohibit panhandling, or the demand of money, gifts or donations within public buildings or designated areas of that public building or public transportation areas upon the request of the owners, lessees, managing or authorizing agents of the public building or areas in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(d)  Aggressive panhandling is disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and contributes to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places and to a sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
(e)  The presence of individuals who solicit money from persons in places that are confined, difficult to avoid, or where a person might find it necessary to wait, is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime. 
(f)  This article is intended to protect citizens from the disruption, fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation, and not to limit constitutionally protected activity. 
(g)  This article shall be applied in harmony with the provisions of sections 94-55 through 94-83 of the city code relating to solicitations occurring along rights-of-way and associated licensing and sections 94-105 through 94-115 of the city code relating to the licensing of solicitors, peddlers and hawkers.

(f)  Wrecker operators will be listed only once on each list and only in the name under which they are qualified under the provisions of this article and under which they are conducting business in this state.

The wrecker must acknowledge the rotation call by contacting the police communications center within five minutes after the rotation call was received by the answering service.

The wrecker operator will be given the option of removing all of the disabled vehicles to be removed if the operator maintains the number of qualified drivers and trucks to accomplish removal within the city. If the wrecker operator in the city lacks the capacity to remove all of the vehicles, it shall nevertheless be called and additional wrecker operators shall be called as needed from the rotation list. Class C operators which maintain one or more Class C units in the city may respond to a Class C call by utilizing approved Class C units owned by that operator from the city or by using approved Class C units from another approved Class C operator located in the city, provided that the response can be made within a reasonable time under existing conditions and circumstances. The first wrecker on the list will have a choice of wrecked vehicles. If the first wrecker does not arrive on the scene within a reasonable time, the police officer will assign vehicles to available operators. The first wrecker on the scene may be required to move vehicles from the roadway, and such movement will not affect the choice of wrecked vehicles. No fee shall be charged for such service. 
(n)  Wrecker files and wrecker logs shall be maintained at the police department. 
(o)  Wrecker operators may request in writing to the chief of police to be taken temporarily off the list once within a 90-day period. 
(p)  The chief of police is authorized to limit the number of wrecker operators participating in the city. Wrecker operators currently participating in the system shall not be affected. The chief of police shall establish the number of operators for the city based on maintaining adequate and timely public service as well as minimizing the police department's management of the rotation system. The number may be revised if the chief of police finds that the public is not being adequately served as a result of an insufficient number of qualified wrecker operators. 
(q)  If a wrecker responds to a call pursuant to this article and removal of the vehicle is not required, the wrecker operator may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed $35.00 for services rendered, which shall include, but not be limited to, changing a flat tire, providing gas or use of battery jumper cables, or assisting in starting a vehicle. The fee does not include the cost of parts or labor required for any authorized vehicle repairs made at roadside, which may be charged by the wrecker operator in addition to the service fee. A wrecker operator is prohibited from assessing a towing charge if the vehicle is not removed. The wrecker operator which renders services rather than towing a vehicle shall not be rotated to the bottom of the list but shall remain at the top of the list for the next available call. 
(r)  For a period of at least one year from the date of the rendering of services to a vehicle, the wrecker operator shall retain a record of the name, driver's license number, address, and telephone number of the driver of the vehicle, the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle if different from the driver, and the make, model and vehicle identification number of the vehicle which was assisted by the wrecker operator. This information shall be provided to the police department upon request for verification. Providing false information to the police department concerning the services rendered to the vehicle or the identification of the driver or the owner shall result in the removal of the wrecker operator from the rotation list pursuant to section 58-117. 
(s)  When a wrecker responds to a call by the police department to remove an abandoned vehicle, the wrecker shall not be rotated to the bottom of the rotation list, but shall remain at the top of the list for the next available call.

Sec. 58-114. - Response to calls. 
(a)  The wrecker operator shall respond to all requests for service made through the police communications duty officer within a reasonable time under the existing conditions and circumstances. If response cannot be made within a reasonable time, the wrecker operator shall notify the police communications duty officer of the estimated time of delay and the reasons for the delay. The police communications duty officer may then cancel the request for service, rotate the wrecker operator to the bottom of the list and request the services of the next available wrecker operator. 
(b)  Unless authorized by the police department duty officer, flashing amber lights shall not be used while responding to a call for wrecker service. 
(c)  Flashing amber lights shall be used in accordance with F.S. § 316.2397(3). 
(d)  When a vehicle is released at the scene by the investigating officer or representative of the police department, the wrecker operator shall not tow the vehicle to any location outside the city unless the owner so requests. 
(e)  Any ancillary service, such as the use of dolly, dropping and hooking up linkage, is to be performed only if required and appropriate. 
(f)  The motor vehicle owner or operator is responsible for payment of charges imposed by the wrecker operator.

An example of such condition includes being under the influence of alcohol or any chemical substance or controlled substance.

(a)  Each tow truck owned or maintained by a wrecker operator shall be commercially manufactured and shall conform to the requirements of this article. The requirements for commercial manufacture of trucks and equipment are waived for those operators who have been on the police department's rotation list for one year prior to January 22, 1986. The wrecker and equipment shall be operable. 
(b)  The tow truck and equipment shall be inspected by the chief of police or his designee and approved by the chief of police before being placed on the rotation list. Thereafter, trucks and equipment shall be subject to periodic checks which shall include, but not be limited to, annual inspections. 
(c)  Sirens on wreckers are prohibited. 
(d)  The wrecker operator shall not represent or imply on any vehicle, building or correspondence an official relationship between the wrecker operator and the police department. 
(e)  It is prohibited for a tow truck or the business establishment maintained by the wrecker operator to have any equipment capable of monitoring messages or signals or frequencies assigned to the police department. 
(f)  All trucks operated pursuant to this article shall be equipped with a business-type communication radio or mobile telephone or cellular telephone. There shall be one radio or phone for each truck. Such equipment shall be licensed and approved by the Federal Communications Commission. The mobile radio or telephone shall enable the wrecker operator to communicate with his area of operation from any point within the city. A citizens band radio does not meet the requirements of this section. The chief of police may waive this requirement for all wrecker operators within the city upon a showing that due to the limited number of operators in the city the installation of such communication devices is unnecessary or cost prohibitive or that the service is not readily available. 
(g)  Specifications and required equipment shall be as follows: 
(1)  All wreckers (all classifications) shall include the following:

The continued use of a suspended wrecker unit shall constitute grounds for the emergency suspension of the wrecker operator. 
(2)  If this is the only wrecker unit maintained by the operator which has been approved by the police department for its class and zone of operation, the wrecker operator shall be suspended immediately by the department from the list in the city for the class. The department shall issue a "Notice of Emergency Suspension and Administrative Complaint (Inspection)," Police Department Form No. 6, to effect the suspension. The suspension shall continue until such time as the wrecker successfully passes inspection and is approved for use, or the wrecker operator is removed from the list for failure to pass inspection. The wrecker operator must correct the deficiencies and request to have the wrecker unit re-inspected within 30 days from the date of the suspension. If the wrecker unit has not been re-inspected and approved within the 30-day period, the wrecker operator shall be removed from the list. 
(f)  If the wrecker operator's insurance policy is canceled or not renewed according to the requirements of section 58-116: 
(1)  The wrecker operator shall be immediately suspended from the list by the department. "Notice of Emergency and Administrative Complaint (Insurance)," Sanford Police Department Form No. 5, shall be issued by the department. The use of a wrecker by a wrecker operator who does not maintain the insurance coverage required by this article is declared to be an immediate serious danger to the public health, safety or welfare requiring the immediate suspension of the wrecker operator. 
(2)  If the required insurance coverage is not obtained and provided to the police department on the "Statement of Compliance," Police Department Form No. 9, within 30 calendar days of the date of cancellation or expiration, the wrecker operator shall be removed from the list.

Sec. 58-121. - Storage facilities. 
(a)  Generally. Wrecker operators shall provide storage facilities which shall be maintained at the operator's place of business and located within the city. These facilities must be fenced and locked for the protection of vehicles and property. 
(b)  Vehicle storage location. The wrecker operator shall provide storage for all impounded/towed vehicles in the outside storage area unless specific written instructions are given for inside storage by the impounding officer or the owner. If required for investigative purposes, the wrecker operator shall move the vehicle to a designated area for processing prior to storage. In such instance, the police department will not authorize release of the vehicle until all outstanding charges by the operator, as authorized by the police department, have been satisfied. 
(c)  Change of vehicle storage location. The wrecker operator shall not change the type of storage facility (inside or outside) afforded a vehicle without written permission from the chief of police or his designee. The wrecker operator shall not change the storage facility location without first obtaining written permission from the chief of police or his designee. 
(d)  Facilities at place other than operator's place of business. If impractical because of zoning or other considerations such as lack of space, storage facilities may be maintained within the city at a place other than a wrecker operator's place of business so long as the following requirements are met as to such storage facility: 
(1)  The storage facility is located in the city within five miles of the wrecker operator's place of business. 
(2)  The storage facility must be owned or leased solely by the wrecker operator and vehicles stored by the operator must be separately fenced and locked. 
(e)  Inspection of stored vehicles. The registered owner of a vehicle or the owner's representatives or owner's insurance adjusters, upon proper identification, shall be permitted to inspect or photograph stored vehicles during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The wrecker operator shall not require the owner, adjuster or representative to pay any fee in order to inspect or photograph the stored vehicle. 
(f)  Fencing; illumination. All fencing shall be chainlink or solid-wall type, at least six feet high, to discourage theft of any vehicle or any property being stored. All storage facilities shall be illuminated with lighting of sufficient intensity to reveal persons and vehicles at a distance of at least 150 feet during nighttime. 
(g)  Inside storage facilities. Permanent inside storage facilities must be available for 24-hour storage when weather or other conditions require inside storage for protection of the vehicle or personal property. A lean-to, tent or shed does not meet the requirements of this section. Inside storage must be in a weathertight building. 
(1)  A minimum of 25 storage spaces with three inside storage spaces must be available. Wrecker operators who have been on the police department's rotation system for six months prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection is derived may continue on the list without regard to the minimum storage spaces required in this subsection, so long as all other applicable provisions of this article are met. 
(2)  Service bays or repair bays do not qualify as inside storage, nor does any area that is utilized for any activity other than serving as a permanent inside storage area, when vehicles are actually stored inside at the request of a law enforcement agency or the owner of a vehicle. 
(h)  Police hold orders. Wrecker operators shall comply with hold orders placed by the police department, including in a fatality and sealed by the traffic homicide investigator shall remain intact until the seals are removed by the investigator. If no fatality occurred, then the vehicle and the property may be released by the wrecker operator upon valid proof of ownership once the hold is released. 
(i)  Handling of personal property. A copy of an inventory prepared by the police department, of all personal property found in a wrecked, disabled or abandoned vehicle, shall be provided to the wrecker operator. The wrecker operator shall permit the removal of such property by the vehicle owner or his agent from a stored vehicle during normal business hours without charge. The agent's authority shall be evidenced by a writing acknowledged by the owner before a notary public or other person empowered by law to administer oaths. A signed receipt for each article removed by the owner or his agent shall be obtained. Personal property shall be defined as any item not affixed to the vehicle which was in the vehicle at the time of the tow. In case of vehicles stored where no "hold order" has been placed, the wrecker operator will directly release any vehicle upon presentation of proper proof of identification and ownership. If these conditions cannot be met due to unusual or extraordinary circumstances, the vehicle will be released only upon authorization obtained from the police department. 
(j)  Care of vehicles and contents. Wrecker operators handling the initial tow shall exercise reasonable care and control of parts and contents located in vehicles while under their protection or while in storage. 
(k)  Staffing. During the hours from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, wrecker operators will provide adequate staffing at the storage facility so that personal property may be removed from the vehicle or the vehicle itself may be released without undue delay. 
(l)  Access to vehicles during hours when facility is not staffed. Should it become necessary that personal property be removed from a vehicle or a vehicle be released when the storage facility is not staffed, the wrecker operator will be required to do so and allowed to charge a reasonable fee.

Cross reference- Police, ch. 78; tax for funding of police officers' retirement, § 98-32. 

Sec. 66-31. - Definitions. 
(1)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions, plus the amount described in section 66-36(e)(3), all without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth of the average base pay of the five best years of credited service of the last ten years prior to retirement, termination or death or the career average as a full-time police officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    Base pay means the pay for the grade and step in the salary classification pay plan in the city for the given fiscal year, including education incentive payments and plus all tax-deferred, tax sheltered or tax-exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions and otherwise includible in base pay. Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Sanford, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment. 
    In addition, a member may receive credited service for periods which the member is absent from employment and receiving workers' compensation benefits for injuries sustained while acting as a police officer for the city, up to the time maximum medical improvement is reached, as determined in accordance with the Florida Workers' Compensation Law. 
    The years or fractional parts of years that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a police officer with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(a)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(b)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(c)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five years. 
(d)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Effective date means the date on which this article becomes effective. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Gross pay means the total cash remuneration, excluding worker's compensation. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Police officer means an actively employed full-time person, employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic, or highway laws of the State of Florida. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the Deferred Retirement Option Plan.

Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder.

All funds of the police officers' retirement system may be deposited by the board, with the finance director of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the finance director of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the finance director or clearly identified as such funds of the police officers' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the police officers' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280.

Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  Required financial records . All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(a)  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis, and 
(b)  Receipts and disbursements, and

(5)  Annual audit . An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  Investment powers and authority of board . The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(a)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Sanford City Commission to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(b)  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in Chapter 185, Florida Statutes to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan.

(iii)  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
(c)  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 185.06, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(d)  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(e)  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(f)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(g)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(h)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(i)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee, under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(j)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction, or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(k)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(l)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(m)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

(1)  Member contributions. 
(a)  Amount . Effective October 1, 2017, each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of six and one-tenth percent of his or her gross pay. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(b)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(2)  State contributions.

(3)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system, but in no event shall the city's annual contribution be less than ten percent of the total base pay of members for funding benefits provided for herein, including that in section 66-36(e)(3). Such annual requirement shall be funded in quarterly installments. 
(4)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

a.  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter.

(2)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection (c)(2) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.

The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable.

d.  A spouse beneficiary may elect an actuarial equivalent life annuity optional form of benefit, and the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to section 66-37, subsection (7). 
e.  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in a. or b. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
f.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 701/2. 
g.  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection a. or b. above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(3)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with nonspouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement and the member's death did not result directly from an occurrence arising in the performance of duty, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
c.  In any event, if the member's death is caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer (in line of duty), the beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement (unreduced) based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of death. The minimum benefit shall be 40 percent of average final compensation. The presumptions in subsection (d)(2) of this section shall apply in determining whether a death was in line of duty. 
d.  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to section 66-37, subsection (7). 
e.  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection a., b. or c. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions.

g.  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
h.  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(d)  Disability . 
(1)  Disability benefits on-duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he or she is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and fifty-hundredths percent of base pay at the date of disability for each year of credited service prior to October 1, 2017 and three percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service after October 1, 2017, but in any event the minimum amount to be paid to the member shall be equal to 50 percent of the base pay of the member at the date of disability. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the event a member is determined by the board to be disabled in-line of duty and the disability resulted from the perpetration of an intentional act of violence directed toward the police officer and the board reasonably believes the perpetrator intended to cause great bodily harm or permanent disfigurement of the police officer, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 80 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  On duty presumptions . 
(a)  Presumption . Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(b)  Additional presumption . The presumption provided for in this subparagraph (b) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph (b) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions . As used in this subsection (2)(b), the following definitions apply: 
a.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
b.  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
c.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
d.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
e.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption . Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
a.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
b.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
c.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization . Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of exposures . The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical . In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
a.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
b.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(3)  Disability benefits off-duty. Any member with five years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he or she is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his or her duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and fifty-hundredths percent of base pay at the date of disability for each year of credited service prior to October 1, 2017 and three percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service after October 1, 2017. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he or she is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(4)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits . Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
a.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
b.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
c.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
d.  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a police officer with the City of Sanford shall have terminated. 
e.  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(5)  Physical examination requirement . A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render, useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
If the member recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(6)  Disability payments . The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
a.  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
b.  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the one hundred twentieth monthly payment, whichever is later. 
In the event that a disability retiree is re-employed as a police officer for the City of Sanford, or for any other municipal, county, state or federal law enforcement department as a certified police officer, he shall be deemed to have recovered from his disability. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 66-37, subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(7)  Workers' compensation . When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440 and/or any other disability benefit provided by the city, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from all sources exceeds one hundred (100) percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or two percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(e)  Vesting . If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions, or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the terminated member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions, and provided member survives to his otherwise early or normal retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(3)  In the event a member elects to receive his accumulated contributions in lieu of any benefits hereunder, he shall also receive an additional lump-sum amount equal to five percent of the member's base pay for all years of credited service since October 1, 1976. 
(f)  Maximum pension. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n)) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
a.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
b.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
c.  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections a. and b. above. 
(3)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
c.  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
a.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
b.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
c.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
a.  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
b.  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in (5)a. above shall not apply. 
c.  The reductions provided for in (5)a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 66-36(d), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-36(c). 
d.  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than ten years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 66-36(d), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-36(c). 
(7)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten thousand dollar-limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 66-36(f), the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (f)(8) of section 66-36 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (f)(8) of section 66-36 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(9)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service credit purchase limits. 
a.  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in section 66-43 and section 66-44, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (10)a.1., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph (10)b.2. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
1.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (10)b.2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(11)  Contribution limits. 
a.  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
(i)  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
(ii)  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (11)b.1. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
c.  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
d.  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (f)(11) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(12)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
a.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
b.  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(g)  Minimum distribution of benefits . 
(1)  General rules . 
a.  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
b.  Precedence . The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
c.  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections . Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (1)c., distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(2)  Time and manner of distribution . 
a.  Required beginning date . The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
b.  Death of member before distributions begin . If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (2)b., other than subsection (2)b.1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (2)b., distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (2)b.4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1. the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
c.  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
d.  Form of distribution . Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year . 
a.  General requirements . If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
2.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 66-36(a), (b), (c), or (e), or section 66-37 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 66-36(c)) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

Sec. 66-37. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(a)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(b)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
(c)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(d)  For members who do not participate in the DROP pursuant to section 66-46, the member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
1.  Ten percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 90 percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b) or (c) above. 
2.  Fifteen percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 85 percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b) or (c) above. 
3.  Twenty percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 80 percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b) or (c) above. 
4.  Twenty-five percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 75 percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b) or (c) above. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (1)(b) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. Effective January 1, 2005, any current retiree, regardless of his date of retirement, may elect the options provided for in this subsection (2). In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(3)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 66-32(2). 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 66-36(c). 
(b)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(c)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 66-36(2). 
(d)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 66-36(a)(1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the in the amount or amounts computed as if the had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(e)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(6)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Code 1973, § 2-267; Ord. No. 3188, § 10, 12-27-1993; Ord. No. 3406, § 1, 4-27-1998; Ord. No. 3562, § 7, 5-22-2000; Ord. No. 3966, § 2, 12-12-2005; Ord. No. 4016, § 1, 9-25-2006; Ord. No. 4115, § 1, 6-23-2008; Ord. No. 4197, § 12, 1-11-2010; Ord. No. 2016-4381, § 8, 6-27-2016)

2.  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments.

(4)  Pension validity. The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension shall heretofore have been granted under any prior or existing law, or shall hereafter be granted or obtained erroneously, fraudulently or illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls or correct the pension amount of any person heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or any person hereafter granted a pension or heretofore granted under this article if the same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any person who has heretofore under any prior or existing law been or who shall hereafter under this article be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified.

(d)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(e)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (b), the amounts determined under subsection (c). 
    If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

(Code 1973, § 2-273; Ord. No. 3688, § 4, 12-10-2001; Ord. No. 3705, § 2, 4-22-2002; Ord. No. 3903, § 4, 11-22-2004; Ord. No. 4016, § 1, 9-25-2006; Ord. No. 4197, § 16, 1-11-2010) 
Sec. 66-44. - Prior police service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in section 66-31, the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a police officer with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a full-time police officer for any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department in the State of Florida shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement.

(7)  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a police officer as provided for in this section, in addition to service as a police officer in this state, credit may be purchased by the member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the criminal justice standards and training commission within the department of law enforcement, as provided under F.S. ch. 943, or the police officer provides proof to the board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a police officer under section 66-31. 
(Code 1973, § 2-274; Ord. No. 3688, § 5, 12-10-2001; Ord. No. 3705, § 3, 4-22-2002; Ord. No. 3903, § 5, 11-22-2004; Ord. No. 4016, § 1, 9-25-2006; Ord. No. 4197, § 17, 1-11-2010; Ord. No. 2016-4381, § 9, 6-27-2016) 
Sec. 66-45. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(1)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(2)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(3)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a police officer, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. 
(4)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (2) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(5)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(6)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 3903, § 6, 11-22-2004; Ord. No. 4016, § 1, 9-25-2006) 
Sec. 66-46. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section 66-46, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  "DROP " means the City of Sanford Police Officers' Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(2)  "DROP account " means the account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c). 
(3)  "Total return of the assets" means for purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to subsection (c)(2)b.2., for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total plan assets. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a police officer, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection 1. above, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) when he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's base pay for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as base pay as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in section 66-45, reemployment after retirement. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a police officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a police officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a police officer. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account . A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and earnings on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system . 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited with earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation date plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the police department. A member employed by the police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits, and he will accrue additional credited service only as provided for in section 66-45. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution . Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "Minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 66-41. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 66-46 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 66-46 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("share plan") shall be further allocated to the members and DROP participants in a manner to be agreed upon.

Sec. 66-71. - Definitions. 
(1)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions, without interest, plus the amount described in section 66-76(e)(3). For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan(s actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth of the average base pay of the five best years of credited service of the last ten years prior to retirement, termination or death, or the career average as a full-time firefighter, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    Base pay means the pay for the grade and step in the salary classification pay plan in the city for the given fiscal year, including all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions and otherwise includible in base pay. Base pay shall also include "education incentive", "engineer incentive", as well as "paramedic incentive" paid to firefighters who are certified as paramedics and specialty pay. Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Sanford, Florida.

    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a firefighter with member contributions when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a firefighter. Upon any reemployment, a firefighter shall not receive credit for years or fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the firefighter repays into the fund, within 90 days after his reemployment as a firefighter, all the contributions he has withdrawn, plus interest for the period the funds were withdrawn at the rate assumed by the actuarial valuation for the fund on the contribution from the date of withdrawal to date of repayment. Such repayment of contributions shall include any additional lump sum amounts withdrawn equal to five percent of the member's base pay for all years of credited service from October 1, 1976 to June 30, 1998, as referenced in section 66-75(e)(4), plus interest thereon at the rate assumed by the actuarial valuation. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the fire department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the fire department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a firefighter with the fire department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. 
    In addition, a member may receive credited service for periods which the member is absent from employment and receiving workers' compensation benefits for injuries sustained while acting as a firefighter for the city, up to the time maximum medical improvement is reached, as determined in accordance with the Florida Workers' Compensation Law. 
    The years or fractional parts of years that a member performs "Qualified Military Service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L.103-353), after separation from employment as a firefighter with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(a)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(b)  The member returns to his employment as a firefighter within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(c)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five years. 
(d)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Effective date means April 27, 1998. 
    Firefighter means an actively employed full-time person employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a firefighter as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 633.408, and whose duty it is to extinguish fires, to protect life and to protect property. The term includes all certified, supervisory, and command personnel whose duties include, in whole or in part, the supervision, training, guidance, and management responsibilities of full-time firefighters, part-time firefighters, or auxiliary firefighters but does not include part-time firefighters or auxiliary firefighters. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed firefighter who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary.

However, any funds so deposited with the finance director of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the finance director or clearly identified as such funds of the firefighters' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the firefighters' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  Required financial records. All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following:

Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  Investment powers and authority of board. The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(a)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city commission to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(b)  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following:

In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board(s investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, or Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan.

These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(d)  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(e)  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(f)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(g)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(h)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(i)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(j)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction, or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(k)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(l)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(m)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

(2)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
a.  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a firefighter and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
b.  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph a. above, reduced by three percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a firefighter. 
(3)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this subsection must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(c)  Pre-retirement death. 
(1)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement and whose death did not result directly from an occurrence arising in the performance of duty, shall receive a refund of 100 percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(2)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection (c)(2) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, and the member's death did not result directly from an occurrence arising in the performance of duty, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
c.  In any event, if the member's death is caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter (in line of duty), the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement (unreduced) based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of death. The minimum benefit shall be 40 percent of average final compensation. The presumptions in subsection (d)(2) of this section shall apply in determining whether a death was in line of duty. 
d.  A spouse beneficiary may elect an actuarial equivalent life annuity optional form of benefit, and the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to section 66-77, subsection (7). 
e.  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in a. or b. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
f.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 701/2. 
g.  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection a. or b. above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(3)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with nonspouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement and the member's death did not result directly from an occurrence arising in the performance of duty, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
c.  In any event, if the member's death is caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter (in line of duty), the beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement (unreduced) based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of death. The minimum benefit shall be 40 percent of average final compensation. The presumptions in subsection (d)(2) of this section shall apply in determining whether a death was in line of duty. 
d.  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to section 66-77, subsection (7). 
e.  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection a., b. or c. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
f.  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection a. or b. above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
g.  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
h.  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(d)  Disability. 
(1)  Disability benefits on-duty . Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and eight-hundredths percent of base pay at the date of disability for each year of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount to be paid to the member shall be equal to 60 percent of the base pay of the member at the date of disability. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the event a member is determined by the board to be disabled in-line of duty and the disability resulted from the perpetration of an intentional act of violence directed toward the firefighter and the board reasonably believes the perpetrator intended to cause great bodily harm or permanent disfigurement of the firefighter, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 80 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  On duty presumptions. 
(a)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(b)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph (b) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph (b) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (2)(b), the following definitions apply: 
a.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
b.  "Emergency rescue" or "public safety member" means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
c.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
d.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
e.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption . Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
a.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
b.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
c.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
a.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
b.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(3)  Disability benefits off-duty . Any member with five years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and eight-hundredths percent of base pay at the date of disability for each year of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(4)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
a.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
b.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
c.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
d.  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the City of Sanford shall have terminated. 
(5)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
If the member recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(6)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
a.  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
b.  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 66-77, subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(7)  Workers' compensation . When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440 and/or any other disability benefit provided by the city, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from all sources exceeds 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or two and three quarters percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(e)  Vesting. If a member terminates his employment as a firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions, or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the terminated member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions, and provided member survives to his otherwise early or normal retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(3)  In the event a member elects to receive his accumulated contributions in lieu of any benefits hereunder, he shall also receive an additional lump-sum amount equal to five percent of the member's base pay for all years of credited service between October 1, 1976 and June 30, 1998. 
(f)  Maximum pension. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n)) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
a.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
b.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
c.  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections a. and b. above. 
(3)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
c.  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
a.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
b.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
c.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
a.  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
b.  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in (5)a. above shall not apply. 
c.  The reductions provided for in (5)a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 66-76(d), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-76(c). 
d.  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than ten years of participation . The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 66-76(d), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-76(c). 
(7)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten thousand dollar-limit; less than ten years of service . Notwithstanding anything in this section 66-76(f), the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (f)(8) of section 66-76 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (f)(8) of section 66-76 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(9)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service credit purchase limits. 
a.  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 66-83 and 66-84, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (10)a.1., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph (10)b.2. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
1.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (10)b.2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(11)  Contribution limits. 
a.  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
(i)  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
(ii)  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (11)b.1. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
c.  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
d.  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (f)(11) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(12)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
a.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
b.  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit . If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(g)  Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(1)  General rules. 
a.  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
b.  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
c.  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (1)c., distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(2)  Time and manner of distribution. 
a.  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
b.  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (2)b., other than subsection (2)b.1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (2)b., distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (2)b.4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
c.  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
d.  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
a.  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
2.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 66-76(a), (b), (c), or (e), or section 66-77 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 66-76(c)). is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g. monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(4)  General distribution rules. 
a.  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
b.  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(l) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(5)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 40l(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 66-76(c). 
(h)  Forfeiture of pension. 
(1)  Any member who is convicted of the following offenses committed prior to retirement, or whose employment is terminated by reason of his admitted commission, aid or abetment of the following specified offenses, shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this system, except for the return of his accumulated contributions as of the date of termination. Specified offenses are as follows:

g.  The committing on or after October 1, 2008, of any felony defined in F.S. § 800.04, against a victim younger than sixteen (16) years of age, or any felony defined in F.S. ch. 794, against a victim younger than 18 years of age, by a public officer or employee through the use or attempted use of power, rights, privileges, duties, or position of his or her public office or employment position. 
(2)  Conviction shall be defined as an adjudication of guilt by a court of competent jurisdiction; a plea of guilty or a nolo contendere; a jury verdict of guilty when adjudication of guilt is withheld and the accused is placed on probation; or a conviction by the Senate of an impeachable offense. 
(3)  Court shall be defined as any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction which is exercising its jurisdiction to consider a proceeding involving the alleged commission of a specified offense. Prior to forfeiture, the board shall hold a hearing on which notice shall be given to the member whose benefits are being considered for forfeiture. Said member shall be afforded the right to have an attorney present. No formal rules of evidence shall apply, but the member shall be afforded a full opportunity to present his case against forfeiture. 
(4)  Any member who has received benefits from the system in excess of his accumulated contributions after member's rights were forfeited shall be required to pay back to the fund the amount of the benefits received in excess of his accumulated contributions. The board may implement all legal action necessary to recover such funds. 
(i)  Conviction and forfeiture; false, misleading or fraudulent statements . 
(1)  It is unlawful for a person to willfully and knowingly make, or cause to be made, or to assist, conspire with, or urge another to make, or cause to be made, any false, fraudulent, or misleading oral or written statement or withhold or conceal material information to obtain any benefit from the system. 
(2)  A person who violates subsection (1) commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in F.S. §§ 775.082 or 775.083. 
(3)  In addition to any applicable criminal penalty, upon conviction for a violation described in subsection (1), a member or beneficiary of the system may, in the discretion of the board, be required to forfeit the right to receive any or all benefits to which the person would otherwise be entitled under the system. For purposes of this subsection, "conviction" means a determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld. 
(Code 1973, § 2-286; Ord. No. 3227, §§ 6-9, 16-18, 23, 10-24-1994; Ord. No. 3355, §§ 1, 2, 8-25-1997; Ord. No. 3406, § 1, 4-27-1998; Ord. No. 3563, § 6, 5-22-2000; Ord. No. 3632, § 2, 5-14-2001; Ord. No. 3702, § 2, 3-25-2002; Ord. No. 3902, § 2, 11-22-2004; Ord. No. 3965, § 2, 12-12-2005; Ord. No. 4015, § 1, 9-25-2006; Ord. No. 4198, §§ 5-11, 1-11-2010; Ord. No. 4296, § 4, 7-22-2013; Ord. No. 2016-4382, §§ 4-8, 6-27-2016) 
Sec. 66-77. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(a)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(b)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
(c)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(d)  For members who do not participate in the drop pursuant to section 66-86, the member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
a.  Ten percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 90 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a), (b), or (c) above. 
b.  Fifteen percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 85 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a), (b), or (c) above. 
c.  Twenty percent of the total value actuarial equivalent of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 80 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a), (b), or (c) above. 
d.  Twenty-five percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 75 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a), (b), or (c) above. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (1)(b) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. Effective January 1, 2005, any current retiree, regardless of his date of retirement, may elect the options provided for in this subsection (2). In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(3)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 66-72(2). 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 66-76(c). 
(b)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(c)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 66-72(2). 
(d)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 66-76(a)(1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(e)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(6)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Code 1973, § 2-287; Ord. No. 3227, § 10, 10-24-1994; Ord. No. 3406, § 1, 4-27-1998; Ord. No. 3563, § 7, 5-22-2000; Ord. No. 3965, § 3, 12-12-2005; Ord. No. 4015, § 1, 9-25-2006; Ord. No. 4086, § 2, 1-14-2008; Ord. No. 4198, § 12, 1-11-2010; Ord. No. 2016-4382, § 9, 6-27-2016) 
Sec. 66-78. - Claims procedures. 
(1)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(2)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Code 1973, § 2-288; Ord. No. 3227, § 12, 10-24-1994; Ord. No. 3406, § 1, 4-27-1998; Ord. No. 4015, § 1, 9-25-2006) 
Sec. 66-79. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(1)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(2)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city commission which shall have the effect of reducing the then-vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries, except that the city may prospectively alter benefits payable to nonvested members. 
(3)  Domestic relations orders; retiree directed payments; exemption from execution, nonassignability. 
(a)  Domestic relations orders . 
1.  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the system's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a retiree, the member or retiree shall submit the proposed order to the board for review to determine whether the system may legally honor the order. 
2.  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments . The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. ch. 175, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(c)  Exemption from execution, nonassignability . Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this article and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this article are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable. 
(4)  Pension validity . The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension shall heretofore have been granted under any prior or existing law, or shall hereafter be granted or obtained erroneously, fraudulently or illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls or correct the pension amount of any person heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or any person hereafter granted a pension or heretofore granted under this article if the same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any person who has heretofore under any prior or existing law been or who shall hereafter under this article be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified. Any overpayments or underpayments shall be corrected and paid or repaid in a reasonable manner determined by the board. 
(5)  Qualification of system . It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(6)  Use of forfeitures . Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(7)  Prohibited transactions. Effective as of January 1, 1989, a board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by Code Section 503(b). 
(8)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended.

Sec. 66-80. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(1)  This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions or if contributions to the system are discontinued, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(3)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
a.  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
b.  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection c. 
c.  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection b. involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the firefighter. 
d.  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection c., and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
e.  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection b., the amounts determined under subsection c. 
If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

Sec. 66-81. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distributions. 
(a)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(b)  Definitions. 
1.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
2.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the [Internal Revenue] Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the [Internal Revenue] Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
3.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
4.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(2)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(a)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans.

The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(b)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the [Internal Revenue] Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(3)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

Sec. 66-85. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(1)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(2)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a firefighter and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(3)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a firefighter, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. 
(4)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (2) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(5)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(6)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 3902, § 6, 11-22-2004; Ord. No. 4015, § 1, 9-25-2006)

(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a firefighter.

c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in section 66-85, reemployment after retirement. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a firefighter, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a firefighter. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a firefighter. 
(c)  Funding.

The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation date plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's 1st month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such nontransferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the fire department. A member employed by the fire department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits, and he will accrue additional credited service only as provided for in section 66-85. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a firefighter.

(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "Minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 2-291. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP.

A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan . Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 66-86 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account . The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion . The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit . The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 2-296 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

(b)  The city will annually appropriate to the fund the aforestated sum at the beginning of the city's fiscal year. The fund shall receive the tax increment above described only as, if and when, such taxes may be collected by the city.

(c)  The agency is directed to establish and set up the fund and to develop and promulgate rules, regulations and criteria whereby the fund may be promptly and effectively administered, including the establishment and the maintenance of books and records and adoption of procedures whereby the agency may, expeditiously and without undue delay, utilize said fund for its allocated statutory purpose subject to annual budgetary approval by the city commission.

Sec. 74-216. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this article, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    Applicant. Any person, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity having an ownership interest in a parcel of real property in the city, or his/her designated lawful attorney-in-fact, who applies for a special permit pursuant to this article.

    Development order. Any order granting, with or without conditions, a permit for development including: any building permit, zoning permit, rezoning, subdivision approval, site plan approval, special exception, conditional use, variance, or any other official action of the city. 
    Investment-backed expectation. The expenditure of substantial sums of money by the applicant which cannot be recovered by the applicant, or an irreversible and substantial change of position that imposes on the applicant an obligation to expend sums of money in the future. 
    Land development regulation. A regulation in the City Code that controls the development of property, including but not limited to regulations for: zoning, land development, utilities, building, life safety, fire and others that affect the use, density or intensity of land use.

(Ord. No. 4130, § 1.0, 8-11-2008) 
Sec. 74-217. - Special permit. 
    Upon application and after review as provided herein, the city commission may authorize as a special permit an exception to the otherwise applicable provisions of the currently effective city comprehensive plan or the city land development code. The special permit shall be a development order for a specific type, level, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development of a specifically described parcel of real property. The special permit may be granted upon a finding by the city commission that the applicant has demonstrated, pursuant to the standards set forth in the following sections of this article, that the applicant has a preexisting vested right to commence, maintain, and complete a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development. The special permit may be granted with or without conditions as may be appropriate considering the evidence adduced and reviewed before the city commission. 
    The special permit is not transferable, in whole or in part, to any other parcel of real property or to any other person, corporation, or other legal entity. 
(Ord. No. 4130, § 2.0, 8-11-2008) 
Sec. 74-218. - Considerations for determination of permit. 
    In determining whether a right to commence, maintain, and complete construction of a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development has been vested, the following factors shall be considered: 
(1)  Whether there has been an act or omission to act by the city; 
(2)  Whether a city official acted or omitted to act and the personnel rank, official position and authority of that official; 
(3)  Whether the city official acted or omitted to act within the course and scope of his/her personnel rank, authority and official position; 
(4)  The nature of the act committed and date thereof, or the nature of the omission to act and approximate date thereof; 
(5)  Whether the applicant made a substantial change in position, or has an investment-backed expectation, based upon the city's act or omission to act; 
(6)  The nature of the applicant's change in position or investment-backed expectation, including expenditure of money or obligation to expend funds, amounts thereof, dates of expenditures; or incurrence of the obligation to incur expenditures, acts committed which represent a change in position, and dates thereof; 
(7)  The good faith of the applicant in substantially changing his/her position, or the incurring of extensive obligations and expenses based upon the city's actions or omissions to act; 
(8)  Any legally permitted acts of the applicant and the specific dates thereof associated with physical improvements on the land or for the design of specific buildings and improvements to be constructed on the site; 
(9)  The extent to which the applicant has secured building permits for, and commenced in whole or in part, but not completed, the construction of physical improvements on the land, utility infrastructure or other public improvements or buildings germane to a phased development that was contemplated to extend over a period of months or years; 
(10)  Whether the applicant prior to or on the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation has made contractual commitments to complete structures and deliver titles thereto or occupancy thereof, and the dates of and amounts of money involved in those commitments; 
(11)  Whether prior to, or on, the date of notice of change in a land development regulation for the currently effective comprehensive plan, land development code, or applicable section of either document, the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution, which, despite a thorough review of alternative solutions, the applicant will be unable to meet, or it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet, unless he is permitted to proceed with the previously permitted specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development; 
(12)  Whether enforcement of the terms of the currently effective comprehensive plan or land development code regulation will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability to third persons, or will leave the applicant completely unable, after thorough review of alternative solutions, to earn a reasonable return on his/her investment in the property; 
(13)  Whether the right of the applicant to commence, maintain, and complete the proposed development, or a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development has been vested only with respect to an identifiable and discreet portion of the applicant's property; and 
(14)  Any other information relevant to understanding the applicant's claim to vested rights to develop his/her real property in a particular manner that may be pertinent under state or federal law. 
(Ord. No. 4130, § 3.0, 8-11-2008) 
Sec. 74-219. - Demonstration of vested rights. 
    The right of the applicant to commence, maintain, or complete construction of a development or to a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development on his/her parcel of real property, or a portion thereof, is vested if the applicant can demonstrate that: 
(1)  The applicant owned the parcel of real property proposed to be developed on the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation, and that the specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development proposed for the parcel of real property was lawful and legally permitted at that time; 
(2)  The applicant has continuously owned the parcel of real property since the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation until the date of the public hearing before the city commission on the special permit application; 
(3)  The most current legislated city comprehensive plan or land development code, or portion thereof, cited by the applicant as being counter to the applicant's vested right to commence, maintain, and complete construction of a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development, has a material and adverse effect upon the applicant's vested right to develop the subject parcel or continue the use of real property as contemplated; 
(4)  By application of the considerations set out in section 74-218, the applicant in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made such a substantial change in position it has an investment-backed expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence, maintain, and complete a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development upon all or a portion of the applicant's parcel of real property; and 
(5)  The requirement that the applicant's property be developed in accordance with the currently effective city comprehensive plan or city land development code will deprive the applicant of a reasonable rate of return on his/her investment or effectuate a substantial change in position, given the substantial change in position of the applicant or the creation of an investment-backed expectation prior to or on the date on which the most current city comprehensive plan or land development code was subject to a notice of a change. In determining the reasonableness of the projected rate of return, the following categories of expenditures shall not be included in the calculation of the applicant's investment: 
a.  Expenditures for professional services that are unrelated to the design or construction of the contemplated improvements proposed; 
b.  Expenditures for taxes, except for any increases in tax expenditures which result from issuance of a development order which would now be contrary to the currently existing city comprehensive plan or land development code; and 
c.  Expenditures which the applicant would have been obligated to incur as ordinary and necessary business expenses including, but not limited to employees' salaries, equipment rental, chattel mortgage payments. 
The fact that the property has been or is in a particular zoning or comprehensive plan district or classification under the currently effective city comprehensive plan or land development code, or any prior city comprehensive plan or zoning ordinance of the city, shall not, in and of itself, establish that an applicant's right to commence, maintain, and complete construction of a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development has been vested. 
(Ord. No. 4130, § 4.0, 8-11-2008) 
Sec. 74-220. - Application process. 
(a)  Any person, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity having an ownership interest in a parcel of real property may file an application for a special permit within six months of the effective date of the amendatory ordinance that rezones, changes the land use of the property, or otherwise materially and adversely affects the applicant's parcel of land (or portion thereof) so as to prohibit the specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development, in whole or in part, or vested rights shall be deemed to have been waived. 
The application shall be filed with the city clerk who shall, upon receipt of the same, stamp the application with the date and time. The application shall contain: 
(1)  A concise and complete recital of the facts, including dates of expenditures or obligation to expend funds, dollar amounts, the nature of expenditures or obligation to expend funds, and other factors which are claimed to support the claim to a vested right to commence, maintain, and complete a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development; 
(2)  A legal description of the parcel of real property and a survey, if available, thereof upon which the applicant claims to have vested development rights; 
(3)  The applicant's name, address, and telephone number, email address and fax number; 
(4)  The name, address, and telephone number, email address and fax number of any attorney or agent who is or will be representing the applicant; 
(5)  A title opinion by an attorney authorized to practice in the State of Florida or a complete abstract of title or other evidence acceptable to the city demonstrating that the applicant has continuously held title to the real property described in the application from the date of the notice of a change in amendatory ordinance in question until the date of application for the special permit. 
(6)  A complete description of the extent and quality of ownership of the real property during that period; 
(7)  An affidavit under penalty of perjury executed by the applicant before a notary public attesting to the truth, accuracy, and veracity of the application based on the applicant's personal knowledge and all attachments thereto; and 
(8)  Such other information relevant to the standards and matters germane to this article as the director of planning and development services may specify. 
(9)  An application fee as shall be established by a resolution of the city commission from time to time. 
(b)  Within 14 days of submission, the city manager will determine whether the petition is technically complete and will accept it or request corrections. A technically incomplete application shall be returned to the applicant with written notification of the deficient items. The applicant shall be granted 14 additional calendar days to complete this application. If a response is not submitted to the city manager within the time specified, the application shall be deemed abandoned. 
(c)  Within 30 calendar days of determining that an application is technically complete, the city manager shall schedule a public hearing before the city commission to review the application and the city commission makes a final determination as to whether or not vested rights have been clearly and convincingly demonstrated. 
(d)  Within seven calendar days after making a final determination of vested rights status, the city commission shall provide the applicant with written notification of the determination of vested rights status. If the city commission determines that vested rights exist the applicant shall have the right to rely upon such written determination and the determination shall be final. 
(e)  Any determination by the city commission with respect to vested rights and the issuance of a special permit under this article shall expire and be of no further force or effect, unless construction is actually commenced on the parcel of real property within one year of the date that the order granting the special permit is filed with the city clerk. For good cause shown by the applicant, the city commission may, in its legislative discretion, extend the foregoing one-year period by a time period of up to one additional year. 
(f)  Any person, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity claiming a vested right to commence, maintain, and complete any specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development of a specific parcel of real property who does not file an application for determination under this article within six months of the effective date of the amendatory ordinance that rezones, changes the land use of the property, or otherwise materially and adversely affects the applicant's real property or portion thereof so as to prohibit the specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development, in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have waived and abandoned the right to seek such a determination. 
(g)  In addition to published notice in a newspaper of general circulation, actual notice of any hearing before the city commission for recognition of vested rights status shall be mailed to the applicant and all persons who are required to be so noticed with regard to applications for a major conditional use.

(a)  Whereas, the City Commission of the City of Sanford, Florida has the power and authority to create and establish special assessment districts under the controlling provisions of State law such as, by way of example only, the provisions of Article VIII, Section 2 of the Constitution of the State of Florida and the provisions of Chapter 166, Florida Statutes, and the controlling case law of the State of Florida; and 
    Whereas, the City Commission of the City of Sanford, Florida, approved numerous agreements with the owners of real property located within the plat of the Whippoorwill Subdivision as recorded at Plat Book 40, Page 60 of the Public Records of Seminole County, Florida; and 
    Whereas, the dedicated right-of-way is generally described as Tract "A" of the Whippoorwill Subdivision and is known as Whippoorwill Court and generally located and described and depicted in Exhibit "A" [attached to Ordinance No. 4196] and made a part hereof by this reference thereto as if fully set forth verbatim within the text of this Ordinance; and 
    Whereas, the owners of Lots located within the Whippoorwill Subdivision and the City of Sanford have agreed that certain improvements will be implemented with regard to Whippoorwill Court which improvements will be funded, in part, by means of special assessments being imposed upon the Lots located within the Whippoorwill Subdivision. 
    The City Commission of the City of Sanford hereby adopts and incorporates into this article the recitals (whereas clauses) to this Ordinance No. 4196, the city staff report and City Commission agenda memorandum relating to the application and the proposed vacation of the right-of-way as set forth herein.

Sec. 78-81. - Findings; purpose. 
    The city commission finds and determines that it is in the public interest and serves a public purpose to create and establish a program whereby police officers of the city are encouraged to reside within the corporate limits of the city. The city commission likewise finds that the expenditure of funds to encourage police officers of the city to reside within the city serves a valid and important public purpose. The city commission further finds that the citizens of the city will be greatly benefited by city police officers residing in city neighborhoods, being available to promptly address public safety emergencies as needed, and serving as positive role models to the children residing in the city. The city commission also finds that the city police department patrol section is involved with community-oriented policing and the city's community policing is a collaborative effort between the police and the community that identifies problems of crime and disorder and involves all elements of the community in the search to resolve these problems. The program will advance the goal of community policing and work to strengthen families and communities. The city commission has concluded that the program needs to be implemented in a manner that reflects highly upon police services and the value to residents of communities while also permitting administrative flexibility as needed to accomplish the day-to-day implementation of the program. Additionally, the city commission adopts the recitals to Ordinance No. 3713 as part of its legislative findings pertaining to this article.

ARTICLE IV. - WATER AND SEWER SERVICE CHARGES AND BILLING PROCEDURES GENERALLY 

Sec. 102-91. - Applicability of charges; free service or preferential rates prohibited; service to city. 
(a)  The city will not render or cause to be rendered any free services of any nature by its water and sewer systems, or any part thereof, nor will any preferential rates be established for users of the same class. If the city or any department, agency, instrumentality, officer or employee thereof shall avail itself of the facilities or services provided by the water and sewer systems, or any part thereof, the same rates, fees or charges applicable to other users receiving like services under similar circumstances shall be charged the city, or any such department, agency, instrumentality, officer or employee. Such charges shall be paid as they accrue, and the city shall transfer from its general funds sufficient sums to pay such charges. The revenues so received shall be deemed to be revenues derived from the operation of the water and sewer systems, and shall be deposited and accounted for in the same manner as other revenues derived from such operation of the water and sewer systems. 
(b)  For the use of and the service rendered by the sewage works, rates and charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of real estate or building that is connected with the city's sewer system or otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sewers of the city, which rates and charges shall be payable as provided in this article and shall be in the amount determinable as follows: 
(c)  Separate meters required. There shall be provided by the owner a separate meter for each single-family living unit and business unit connected to the water system of the city. 
(d)  Relief from the reimbursement to the city of all city costs and expenses necessary to repair the city's potable water utility system resulting from actions of utility customers shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  The relief must not violate any bond covenants to which the city is bound such as, by way of example, the prohibition against providing free services; 
(2)  The utility customer must provide adequate proof that he, she or it was unaware and unknowing of the cause of the damage and did not cause the damage to the city's utility system; and 
(3)  The utility customer must provide evidence that the condition and causes of the damage have been corrected. 
(e)  Relief from the reimbursement to the city of all city costs and expenses necessary to repair the city's sanitary sewer utility system resulting from actions of utility customers shall be limited to subsection (2) of this section and where the flow resulting from the mishap can be clearly demonstrated not to have entered the city's sanitary sewer system. 
(f)  When a customer contends that the city has submitted an erroneous bill or charge for water services to the customer and alleges that the erroneous bill is the result of a malfunction or defect relating to the water meter associated with the customer's account, the city shall test the water meter for accuracy. If the water meter test results in the conclusion that the bill was erroneous as a result of a malfunction or defect relating to the water meter, the city may adjust the customer's bill based upon the results of the test and not charge the water meter test fee. Such action may be taken upon the city making a determination that the specific factual circumstances pertaining to the customer warrant such action. 
(g)  The city shall have the discretion, upon application by a customer, in the case of a leak or malfunction in water lines, to adjust or reduce a charge to a customer for water services when the circumstances demonstrate that the charge would be unfair based upon such circumstances. Such action may be taken upon the city making a determination that the specific factual circumstances pertaining to the customer warrant such action. In making such determinations, which shall be final, the city shall be guided by the following criteria and facts: 
(1)  Whether the customer could have been aware of the malfunction or defect as a reasonably prudent person; and 
(2)  Whether the amount of water consumption is over twice the amount of the average consumption for that time period based upon the prior year's consumption history. 
(h)  The city shall not reduce any bill below the minimum charge established for water service. 
(i)  The city may waive late charges and assessments imposed upon a customer for failure to pay a charge or assessment when the city concludes, upon application by the customer, that the failure to make the payment was not the fault of the customer; provided, however, that if the payment of a due water bill is not made within five days of the waiver, the waiver shall not be implemented, shall be revoked, and shall not be again considered; provided further, however, that the decision of the city shall be final. 
(j)  The city manager, or designee, shall have the power and authority to promulgate and adopt rules and forms as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section.

DIVISION 2. - REGULATIONS 

Sec. 102-271. - General discharge prohibitions. 
(a)  Use of storm sewers and sanitary sewers. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff (including runoff from downspouts), subsurface drainage (including drainage from foundation drains), swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, or noncontact cooling water to any sanitary sewer. Likewise, the discharge of sanitary sewage or other wastes into any storm sewer is prohibited. It is unlawful for a person to violate the prohibitions set forth herein. 
(b)  General prohibitions. No person shall introduce into a WWF any pollutant, which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions in subsection (c) below apply to each industrial user introducing pollutants into a WWF whether or not the industrial user is subject to other pretreatment standards, or any national, state or local pretreatment requirements. No user who begins contributing to or could contribute pollutants to the WWF after the effective date of this article, and who has been so notified, shall be permitted to introduce such pollutants into the WWF until accidental discharge facilities and procedures, as appropriate, have been approved by the city and installed by the industrial user. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility, as necessary, to meet each and every requirement of this article. It is unlawful for a person to violate the prohibitions set forth herein. 
(c)  Specific prohibited discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or wastes to any public sewer and it is unlawful for a person to violate the prohibitions set forth herein. 
(1)  Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant. 
(2)  Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.0 or higher than 9.0, or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the sewage works. 
(3)  Solids or viscous substances in quantities or of a size capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or interference such as, but not limited to garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastic, wood, underground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, paper, dishes, cups, milk containers and the like. Any pollutant, including, but not limited to oxygen demanding pollutants, released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the WWF. 
(4)  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the WWF resulting in interference regardless of temperature resulting in the discharge from treatment plant having a temperature that exceeds 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). 
(5)  Wastewater causing any single reading on an explosion hazard meter equal to or greater than five percent at the point of discharge into the WWF, or at any point in the WWF as calibrated using propane for 100 percent of the meter. 
(6)  Any liquids or gases which, by reason of their nature or quantity, may cause fire or explosion, or be injurious in any other way to the sewers, the treatment works structures, or the operation of the treatment works, or cause the effluent from the treatment works to violate applicable effluent standards including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the WWF in a quantity that will cause acute worker health and safety problems.

(Code 1973, § 28-91; Ord. No. 3510, § 2.1, 10-11-1999; Ord. No. 3895, § 3(28-91), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 4087, § 2, 1-18-2008; Ord. No. 4315, § 2, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 102-272. - Federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
(a)  Incorporated by reference. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated by reference. Upon promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular pretreatment industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The city manager or designee, shall notify all affected users of the applicable requirements under F.A.C. ch. 62-625. 
(b)  Compliance with federal categorical pretreatment standards. The federal categorical pretreatment standards specify quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties, which may be discharged into the WWF. All industrial users subject to a federal categorical pretreatment standard shall comply with all requirements of such standard, which includes any monitoring or reporting requirements, and shall also comply with any additional or more stringent limitations contained in this article. 
(c)  Removal credits. Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for removal credits in accordance with F.A.C. ch. 62-625.420. 
(d)  Combined waste stream formula. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director or designee shall impose an alternative limit using the combined waste stream formula in F.A.C. ch. 62-625.410(6). 
(e)  Equivalent concentration or mass limits. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director or designee may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with F.A.C. ch. 62-625.410(4). 
(1)  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
a.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
b.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
c.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
d.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
e.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
(2)  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
a.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
b.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
c.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the city whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 102-272(e)(1)c. of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the city will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
d.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to this section as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
(3)  When developing equivalent mass limits, the city: 
a.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
b.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
c.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment. 
(f)  Variances. A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in F.A.C. ch. 62-625.700, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(g)  Net gross adjustment. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with F.A.C. ch. 62-625.820. 
(h)  Compliance. It is unlawful for a person to fail to comply with, or violate, the provisions of this section. 
(Code 1973, § 28-92; Ord. No. 3510, § 2.2, 10-11-1999; Ord. No. 3895, § 3(28-92), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 4087, § 2, 1-14-2008; Ord. No. 4315, § 2, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 102-273. - Specific pollutant limitations. 
(a)  Discharging wastewater pollutants in excess of local limits. No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the local limits for those pollutants which have been established for the city WWF using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass through, interference, protection of WWF employees, and adverse effects on wastewater residuals disposal. 
(b)  Discharging waste streams. No industrial user shall discharge process waste streams, unregulated waste streams, or dilute waste streams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the director. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each SIU wastewater permit issued. 
(c)  Modification of local limits. The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, WWF operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation shall be effective 30 days from notice of acceptance of the modified limits by FDEP. Permitted SIUs shall also be issued an addendum to their wastewater discharge permit containing the new local limits. 
(d)  Imposition of mass limitations. The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWF. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. At his or her discretion, the director may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations. 
A copy of the approved local limits is available upon request at the following location: 
City of Sanford Utility Department 
300 North Park Avenue 
Sanford, FL 32771 
(e)  Pollutants processed or stored; prohibited. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the WWF. No person shall discharge wastewater or any substance containing in excess of the limits and measured at the point of discharge into the sewer system. F.A.C. ch. 62-625.540 requires modification of pretreatment programs at any time to reflect changing conditions at the WWF. Program modification is necessary whenever there is a significant change in the operation. The pollutant limits set out in this document are established to protect against pass-through and interference and apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWF. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. 
(1)  The pollutant limits set out in the local pollutant limits document may be adjusted and additional pollutant limits added from time to time based on treatment plant monitoring, water quality requirements, field investigation of industrial users, and/or any other factors which the city deems of significance with respect to the proper and safe operation of the WWF. The city may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations above. 
(2)  No person shall discharge any substance that will pass through or inhibit the WWF to comply with state and/or federal requirements for receiving waters. Specific pollutant limitations for industrial discharges shall meet federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
(3)  The installation of a garbage disposal into a commercial food facility is prohibited by the city. Installation may be approved by the city manager or designee, for devices discharging into a grease/oil interceptor. 
(4)  Any waters or waste containing phenols or other taste or odor producing substances in such concentration exceeding limits which are established by the city as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the federal, state, local or other public agencies having jurisdiction over such discharge to the receiving waters.

(1)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards; provided, however, that in any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(2)  A user who is seeking to prove an upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant and competent substantial evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with any and all applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission shall be provided within five days. 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance including, but not limited to, exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. The following shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards; provided, however, that in any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the affirmative defense shall have the burden of proof. The user shall prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  The following shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards; provided, however, that in any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the affirmative defense shall have the burden of proof. 
(2)  The user shall prove that the user acted in accordance with the following provisions pertaining to bypass. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary set forth in this section, a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. 
(4)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if practicable. 
(5)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain, at a minimum, a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass including, but not limited to, exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours and acknowledged in writing by the user. 
(6)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  As determined by the city, the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  As determined by the city, there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user has submitted all notices as required under this article. 
(7)  The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the provisions set forth in this article.

Sec. 102-352. - Surcharge for high strength waste. 
(a)  The city manager or designee is authorized to prohibit the discharge of wastes into the city's sewer system, which, in his/her discretion, are deemed harmful or otherwise undesirable. 
(b)  The admission into the public sewers of any waters or wastes having a five-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand or total suspended solids greater than 300 parts per million respectively by weight, or containing any quantity of substances having the characteristics described in sections 102-271 and 102-273, shall be subject to the review and approval of the city. 
(c)  Where necessary, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand and the suspended solids to the maximum limits provided for in sections 102-271 and 102-273. Plans, specifications and other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the city, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until such approval is obtained in writing. 
(d)  Extra charges based on the strength of the sewage and liquid wastes shall be made on the following basis: 
(1)  High strength CBOD. The surcharge for high strength CBOD in dollars shall be computed by multiplying the total milligrams per liter of CBOD above 300 milligrams per liter times the metered water used during the billing period, in millions of gallons, times a treatment surcharge factor. The surcharge factor shall be derived annually from the following formula: 
= CBOD surcharge 
factor Cost of treatment per million gallons > 300  
where, cost of treatment per million gallons equals operational costs of the city's sewage treatment plant costs for the preceding fiscal year (including pro rata administrative costs) divided by the total sewage flow through all plants in millions of gallons, and 300 equals the maximum normal CBOD content expressed in milligrams per liter. 
(2)  High-strength TSS. The surcharge for high-strength TSS in dollars shall be computed by multiplying the total milligrams per liter of TSS above 300 milligrams per liter times the metered water used during the billing period, in millions of gallons, times a treatment surcharge factor. The surcharge factor shall be derived annually from the following formula: 
= TSS surcharge factor Cost of treatment per million gallons 300  
where, cost of treatment per million gallons equals operational costs of the city's sewage treatment plant costs for the preceding fiscal year (including pro rata administrative costs) divided by the total sewage flow through all plants in millions of gallons, and 300 equals the maximum normal TSS content expressed in milligrams per liter. 
(3)  Excess nitrogen. There shall be an additional charge of $0.02 per pound of nitrogen in excess of a concentration of three milligrams per liter in the liquid waste being discharged into the system. 
(4)  Excess phosphorus. There shall be an additional charge of $0.06 per pound of phosphorus in excess of a concentration of ten milligrams per liter in the liquid waste being discharged into the system. 
(e)  It is unlawful for a person to fail to comply with, or violate, the provisions of this section.

(2)  A surcharge may be assessed by the city against any user for any discharge of abnormally high strength compatible wastes as defined herein. 
(3)  The surcharge in dollars shall be computed by multiplying the difference in the concentration in mg/l above the defined limitations for each applicable constituent times the conversion factor of 8.34 times the potable water consumption or metered sewer flow during the billing period in millions of gallons (MG) times the respective treatment surcharge factor. 
(4)  The surcharge factor shall be derived each year using the following formula and shall be set forth in the schedule of fees: 
= Surcharge Total Cost of Treatment ($) factor Maximum Constituent loading (lbs.)  
Where: 
Total cost of treatment is the total operational costs including, but not limited to, prorated administrative costs for the WWF during the preceding fiscal year. 
Maximum normal constituent loading is the product of the constituent limit for each compatible waste times a conversion factor of 8.34 times the total wastewater flow for the WWF. 
Surcharge factor shall be expressed in dollars per pound. 
(5)  The surcharge shall be calculated as the product of the current surcharge factor times the difference of the constituent concentration and the maximum allowable limit for the compatible waste constituent in mg/L times the conversion factor of 8.34 times the total flow in million of gallons during the billing cycle. 
(i)  Flow determination. The flow volume for determination of the surcharge shall be based on one of the following: 
(1)  Metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading made by the city; 
(2)  Flow monitoring devices, which measure the actual volume of wastewater, discharged to the WWF and as approved by the city; 
(3)  Flow monitoring devices for other water supplies proceeded from other sources besides the city; or 
(4)  Flow monitoring devices other than those for the city shall be provided, installed, calibrated and maintained at the user's expense and in accordance with the plans that were approved by the director. Flow monitoring devices shall be calibrated at least annually. 
(j)  Constituent concentration. The concentration of constituents in the user's discharge to the WWF shall be determined by samples collected and analyzed by the city. Samples shall be collected in accordance with EPA protocols or standard methods and in such manner to be representative of the actual discharge to the collection system. Samples shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR 136 and F.A.C. ch. 62-160, as may be amended from time to time. The surcharge shall be based on the determination of the constituent concentration by the city. 
(k)  Monitoring. The city shall collect samples routinely, at least once per year. 
(1)  Samples shall be collected routinely of discharges from users that are known to be or suspected of containing abnormal high strength compatible wastes. 
(2)  Samples may be collected manually or using automatic sampling equipment. Grab samples may be taken manually. Composite samples may be retrieved with automatic sampling equipment or performed manually with aliquots of grab samples. 
(3)  To the extent reasonably practicable, samples will be collected to obtain a representative characterization of the user's discharge. Samples may be flow or time proportional. 
(4)  Users shall install and maintain an appropriate monitoring facility including, but not limited to, a control manhole and suitable automatic sampling equipment. Monitoring sites and facilities shall be accessible to the city. 
(5)  The costs of sample analyses performed by a certified commercial laboratory shall be assessed directly to the user. 
(6)  The user may request that the sample analyses be performed by an independent, certified commercial laboratory. The costs for such analyses shall be borne by the user. 
(7)  The charges for sample collection and analysis (laboratory work) shall be those rates as described in the schedule of costs (fees) for the certified commercial laboratory currently under contract with the city as described in the city's oil/grease program manual. 
(8)  The costs of sample collection and analysis may be assessed daily by the city or assignee if such monitoring activities indicate to the city that the wastes are unacceptable or detrimental to the WWF. 
(9)  Users may be assessed the costs for sample collection and laboratory analyses. Charges for additional sample collection and laboratory analyses may be assessed on a daily basis as long as the results show that the user is discharging unacceptable wastes to the WWF. 
(l)  It is unlawful for a person to fail to comply with, or violate, the provisions of this section.

Sec. 102-398. - Spill containment plan; notification of discharge. 
    Each industrial user shall establish a spill containment plan. The plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Protection from accidental discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by the date specified by the industrial wastewater discharge permit. No new user who begins discharge to the WWF after the effective date of this article may introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved and it shall be unlawful to do so. 
(2)  Telephone notification. Any person causing or suffering any discharge, whether accidental or not, which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons or to the environment, or which is likely to cause interference with the WWF, shall notify the city immediately by telephone. In the absence or unavailability of the city, notification shall be given to the city employee then in charge of the treatment works. It shall be the obligation of the reporting person to provide written verification to the city promptly after the telephone notification occurs. 
(3)  Written report; control of discharge during restoration of treatment facility. Within five days following such occurrence, the user shall provide the city with a detailed written report describing the cause of the dangerous discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. Furthermore, the industrial user shall control its production, or all its discharges, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable federal, state, regional and local laws, rules and regulations upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility and until the facility is completely restored or an alternative and equally effective method of pretreatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(4)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(1)  The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule: 
a.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
b.  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
c.  The user shall submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
d.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city. 
(e)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in F.A.C. ch. 62-625.410, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports shall be executed and certified in accordance with this article. 
(f)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the city but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with this article. 
(2)  All wastewater samples shall be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow-measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in section 102-394, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(g)  Reports of changed conditions. 
(1)  All users shall notify the city of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
(2)  The city may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition including, but not limited to, the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
(3)  The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(4)  Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall immediately notify the control authority, (and the public utility if the public utility is not the control authority) in advance of any change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge that may result in pass through or interference at the WWF, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial required notification. 
(5)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(h)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the WWF, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place-advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described above in subsection (h)(1). Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Code 1973, § 28-128; Ord. No. 3895, § 3(28-128), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 4315, § 2, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 102-402. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
    If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. 
(Code 1973, § 28-129; Ord. No. 3895, § 3(28-129), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 4315, § 2, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 102-403. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the city, the EPA regional waste management division, city, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the WWF of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification shall include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the WWF, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications shall take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions shall be submitted under section 102-396. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 102-397 and 102-401. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user shall notify the city, the EPA regional waste management waste division, city, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practicable. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(f)  It is unlawful for a person to fail to comply with, or violate, the provisions of this section. 
(Code 1973, § 28-130; Ord. No. 3895, § 3(28-130), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 4315, § 2, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 102-404. - Analytical requirements. 
(a)  All pollutant analyses, including sample collection techniques required, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the procedures established in the FDEP standard operating procedures (DEP-SOP-001/01), 40 CFR 136, F.A.C. ch. 62-160, and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. 
(b)  Where F.A.C. ch. 62-160, does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures approved by FDEP. 
(c)  All analysis shall be performed by a certified laboratory. 
(Code 1973, § 28-131; Ord. No. 3895, § 3(28-131), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 4315, § 2, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 102-405. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. Except as indicated in subsection (b) and (c) the user shall collect wastewater samples using 24-hour-flow-proportional composite-collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using grab-collection techniques. 
(c)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(d)  It is unlawful for a person to fail to comply with, or violate, the provisions of this section.

(b)  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates that analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses and documentation associated with best management practices. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
(c)  Users that are continuous dischargers shall maintain a record of daily average pH and temperature readings. Continuous monitoring equipment, which has a recording capability, may be required. Access to stored data including daily calibration shall be available and reported, if required. 
(d)  Users that use contract haulers for disposal off site or remove waste materials, sludge from their facility shall keep a copy of each manifest and shall remain available for a period of three years. Wastes removed from the facility shall be disposed at a permitted facility to receive such wastes. In no way shall the pumped matter be returned to any private or public portion of the collection system or the WWF, without prior written approval from the city manager or designee. 
(Code 1973, § 28-134; Ord. No. 3895, § 3(28-134), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 4315, § 2, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 102-408. - Hauled wastewater. 
(a)  Septic tank waste. Septic tank waste may be introduced into the WWF only at locations designated by the city, and at such times as are established by the city. Such waste shall not violate any section of this article or any other requirements established by the city. The city may require commercial septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
(b)  Industrial waste haulers. The city shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The city may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The city also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this article. 
(c)  Limits on locations to discharge industrial waste. Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the city. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the city. The city may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The city may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. The city may prohibit the disposal of hauled waste after reviewing the waste analysis and waste-tracking information. 
(d)  Tracking form for industrial waste haulers. Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Violation of prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 102-271, with the exception of section 102-271(1), (3) and (14), if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypasses. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c)(3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection (4).

Sec. 102-455. - Title; authority; applicability. 
(a)  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Sanford Impact Fee Ordinance." 
(b)  The city commission has authority to adopt this article pursuant to article VIII of the 1968 Florida Constitution, F.S. chs. 163 and 166, and the Charter. 
(c)  Planning for new capital improvements needed to serve new growth and development that generate the need for additional improvements. and the implementation of these plans through the comprehensive planning process, is a responsibility of the city under F.S. § 163.3161 et seq., and is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(Code 1973, § 28-137; Ord. No. 1845, § 1, 12-22-1986) 
Sec. 102-456. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  The city commission has determined and recognized, through adoption of this article and prior impact fee ordinances, that new growth and development which the city will experience will necessitate extensive improvements, capital facilities and infrastructure, including water and sewer systems and plants. In order to finance the necessary new capital improvements, several combined methods of financing shall be employed, one of which will impose a regulatory impact fee on new growth and development which does not exceed the reasonably anticipated costs of the capital expenditures required to serve future growth and new development by providing for needed plant capacity and infrastructure additions. 
(b)  Implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay an impact fee that does not exceed the reasonably anticipated capital costs incurred to serve new growth and development is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the policy and intent of its comprehensive plan, as amended and adopted under F.S. § 163.3161 et seq., and is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(c)  The purpose of this article is to enable the city to allow growth and development to proceed in the city in compliance with the comprehensive plan and to regulate growth and development so as to require growth and development to share in the burdens of growth by paying for the reasonably anticipated capital costs attributable to growth and new development. 
(d)  It is not the purpose of this article to collect fees from growth and development in excess of the cost of the reasonably anticipated capital requirements needed to serve the new growth and development. The city commission hereby finds that this article has approached the problem of determining impact fees in a conservative and reasonable manner. This article will result in only partial recoupment of the capital expenditures attributable to future growth and new development. Impact fees will not be utilized to correct any existing deficiencies in any fashion whatsoever. 
(e)  Absent an impact agreement pursuant to section 102-419(b), it shall be the policy of the city to collect the impact fees assessed by this article in lieu of any off-site improvements. 
(f)  The technical data, findings and conclusions in this article are based on the city's Comprehensive Plan and the water/sewer impact fee study of 1986.

Sec. 102-459. - Impact fee study adopted. 
    The city commission hereby adopts by reference the study entitled "Water/Sewer Impact Fee Study" dated June 13, 2005, as prepared by Public Resources Group, Inc., Maitland, Florida, as it relates to the computation and allocation of the capital costs of new improvements to be borne by new users of such improvements. 
(Code 1973, § 28-141; Ord. No. 1845, § 1, 12-22-1986; Ord. No. 3942, § 1(28-141), 7-11-2005) 
Sec. 102-460. - Fee imposed; fee schedules. 
(a)  Fees generally. There is hereby imposed upon all impact-generating land development activity as herein defined an impact fee due at time of issuance of a building permit, and no building permit shall be issued until said impact fee shall have been paid except as otherwise herein provided. The fee shall be determined in accordance with the following schedules. If the building permit is for less than the entire contemplated development, the fee shall be computed for the amount of development covered by the permit. The obligations for payment of impact fees shall run with the land. 
(b)  Fee schedule. Any person who shall initiate any new impact-generating land development activity shall, except as otherwise provided for herein, pay an impact fee as determined by the law according to the following schedules: 
WATER SYSTEMS IMPACT FEE 
Equivalent Residential Connection (ERC) = 300 gallons per day (GPD) 
Residential: 
$1,193.00/unit-Single-family structure, or multifamily unit containing three bedrooms or more. 
$894.75/unit-Multifamily unit or mobile home unit containing less than three bedrooms. (This category is based on judgment/assumption, estimation that such family units on average require 75% = 225 GPD of the water and sewer service of an average single-family unit.) 
Commercial: 
$1,193.00/ERU-Fixture unit schedule from Southern Plumbing Code will be used. One ERU will be charged for connection and up to 20 fixture units. For projects having more than 20 fixture units the impact fee will be determined by increments of 25 percent based on multiples of five fixture unit base for the first ERU. (Example: 25 fixture units will be rated as 1.25 ERU; 26 fixture units will be rated as 1.5 ERU.) 
SEWAGE SYSTEM IMPACT FEE 
Equivalent Residential Connection = 270 gallons per day (GPD) 
Residential: 
$2,688.00/unit-Single-family structure, or multifamily unit containing three bedrooms or more. 
$2,016.00/unit-Multifamily unit or mobile home unit containing less than three bedrooms. (This category is based on judgment/assumption/estimation that such family units on average require 75 percent of water service of an average single-family unit.) 
Commercial-Industrial-Institutional: 
$2,688.00/unit-Fixture unit schedule from Southern Plumbing Code will be used. One ERU will be charged for connection and up to 20 fixture units. For projects having more than 20 fixture units the impact fee will be determined by increments of 25 percent based on multiples of five fixture units above the 20 fixture unit base for the first ERU. (Example: 25 fixture units will be rated as 1.25 ERU; 26 fixture units will be rated as 1.5 ERU.) 
(c)  Prior agreements. Any developer who, prior to the effective date of this chapter, agreed as a condition of development approval to pay impact fees, shall be responsible for the payment of the fees under the terms of such agreement. Any portion of impact of impact fees agreed to be paid pursuant to a prior agreement that are greater than the fees established herein shall be refunded. Any impact fees paid since November 11, 1985, that are greater than the fees established herein shall be refunded upon request of the payer of the fees or current owners if the property was subsequently transferred. 
(d)  Determination of category. In the event that an applicant for a building permit contends that the land use for which a building permit is proposed is not within the categories set forth in this section or fits a different category than that determined by the utility director, or designee, may make an application for a determination as to the appropriate land use category. Such determination may be appealed to the mayor and the city commission in writing within ten days of the date of the determination of the utility director and upon payment of the established appeal fee. 
(e)  Redevelopment. Where new development involves the redevelopment of land such that existing impact generating development is removed or substantially altered, the new development impact fees shall be computed on the additional or new impacts only. Impact fees shall be computed for the existing development and such sum shall then be subtracted from the impact fees calculated for the new development. It is the city's intent to collect impact fees only relating to the additional impacts generated by redevelopment over and above the impacts attributable to the existing development. 
(f)  The impact fee amounts set forth in this section shall be automatically adjusted annually effective every October 1, beginning on October 1, 2006. The automatic annual adjustment effective each October shall be based on the percentage increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending the previous July. For example, the October 2006 automatic adjustment shall be calculated based on the change in the CPI for the 12-month period ending July 2006. 
(Code 1973, § 28-142; Ord. No. 1845, § 1, 12-22-1986; Ord. No. 3942, § 2(28-142), 7-11-2005) 
Sec. 102-461. - Alternative fee calculation authorized. 
    If an applicant believes that the cost of improvements needed to serve his proposed development is less than the fee established in section 102-460, the applicant may submit an alternative fee calculation to the director of engineering and planning or his designee pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the director of engineering and planning or his designee finds that the data, information, assumptions, formulae and methodology used by the applicant to calculate the alternative impact fee satisfy the requirements of this article, the alternative impact fee shall be deemed the impact fee due and owing for the proposed development. 
(Code 1973, § 28-143; Ord. No. 1845, § 1, 12-22-1986) 
Sec. 102-462. - Procedure for review of alternative fee calculation. 
(a)  The alternative impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information, assumptions, formulae and methodology contained in this article and the studies referred to in sections 102-456(f) and 102-459, or independent sources, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is an accepted standard source of engineering and planning data or information; 
(2)  The independent source is a local study carried out by a qualified planner or engineer pursuant to an accepted methodology of planning or engineering; or 
(3)  Where different data information, assumptions, formulae or methodology are employed such differences shall be specifically identified and justified. 
(b)  An alternative impact fee calculation shall be undertaken through the submission of an application for review of an alternative impact fee calculation for the impact fee component for which an alternative impact fee calculation is requested. A developer may submit such an application for any proposed land development activity for which he concludes the nature, timing, or location of the proposed development make it likely to generate impacts costing substantially more to remedy than the amount of the fee that would be generated by the use of the fee schedules included in this article. 
(c)  Within 20 days of receipt of an application for review of an alternative impact fee calculation, the director of engineering and planning, or his designee, shall determine if the application is complete. If the director of engineering and planning, or his designee, determines that the application is not complete, he shall send a written statement specifying the deficiencies by mail to the person submitting the application. The application shall be deemed complete if no deficiencies are specified. The director of engineering and planning, or his designee, shall take no further action on the application until it is deemed complete. 
(d)  When the director of engineering and planning, or his designee, determines the application is complete, he shall review it and render a written decision in 30 days on whether the fee should be modified, and, if so, what the amount should be. 
(e)  If the director of engineering and planning, or his designee, finds that the data, information, assumptions, formulae and methodology used by the applicant to compute the alternative impact fee calculation satisfy the requirements of this article, the fee determined in the alternative impact fee calculation shall be deemed the fee due and owing for the proposed land development activity. This adjustment in the fee shall be set forth in a fee agreement which shall be entered into pursuant to section 102-463. 
(f)  A determination by the director of engineering and planning, or his designee, that the alternative impact fee calculation does not satisfy the requirements of this section may be appealed to the city commission. 
(Code 1973, § 28-144; Ord. No. 1845, § 1, 12-22-1986) 
Sec. 102-463. - Presumption of maximum impact; impact agreement. 
(a)  The proposed development shall be presumed to generate the maximum impact generated by the development in accordance with the approved site plan and requested building permits. 
(b)  In lieu of the payment of fees as calculated in section 102-459 or 102-460, any applicant may propose to enter into an impact agreement with the city designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards of service appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development proposed. Such an agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which: 
(1)  Modify the presumption of maximum impact set forth in subsection (a) of this section and provide an impact fee which may differ from that set forth in section 102-459 by specifying the nature of the proposed development for the purposes of computing actual impact, provided that the agreement shall establish legally enforceable means for ensuring that the impact will not exceed the impact generated by the agreed upon development. 
(2)  Permit the construction of specific improvements in lieu of or with a credit against the impact fees assessable and/or, pursuant to a payback schedule, allow the developer to recover the actual cost of such improvements in excess of the amount which would have been assessed by this article as subsequent users of such improvements obtain building permits and pay impact fees. 
(3)  Permit a schedule and method for payment of the fees in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 102-459, provided that security is posted ensuring payment of the fees, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, which security may be in the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, negotiable certificate of deposit or escrow account, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit. 
(c)  Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this section shall be presented to and approved by the city commission prior to the issuance of a building permit. Any such agreement may provide for execution by mortgagees, lienholders or contract purchasers in addition to the landowner, and may permit any party to record such agreement in the official records of the county. The city commission shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner, consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors & Builders Association v. City of Dunedin , 329 So.2d 314 (Fla. 1976), Hollywood, Inc. v. Broward County , 431 So.2d 352 (Fla. 1983) and Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County , 446 So.2d 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984), cert. denied 451 So.2d 848 (Fla. 1984). 
(Code 1973, § 28-145; Ord. No. 1845, § 1, 12-22-1986) 
Sec. 102-464. - Credits. 
(a)  An applicant shall be entitled to a credit against any impact fee assessed pursuant to this article in an amount equal to the cost of off-site improvements or contributions of land, money or services for off-site improvements contributed or previously contributed, paid for or committed to by the applicant or his predecessor in interest as a condition of any development permit issued by city for the same development or for excess capacity created by the applicant or his predecessor in interest where such excess capacity is provided at the request of the city and credit for same is agreed to by the city in advance of the creation of the excess capacity and provided for in an impact fee agreement. On-site facilities constructed for effluent disposal up to the capacity needed for the development shall not be considered as a credit, but capacity over and above the needed capacity shall entitle the applicant to a credit with the amount proportional to the approved extra cost. The cost of such improvements shall be based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The actual cost, or estimated cost, of off-site improvements based on recent bid information of the city; and 
(2)  The appraised fair market land value of the contributed parcel as of the date of the building permit, agreement to contribute, or contribution, whichever is earlier, as determined by an MAI appraiser selected and paid for by the applicant. If the director of engineering and planning or his designee disagrees with the appraised value, he may engage another appraiser and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. 
Any credit issued shall take into account as an offset to such credit an amount equal to the impact fee imposed by section 102-459 for all building permits issued to date for the same development as if this article had been in effect at the time of issuance of such permits. 
(b)  Improvements required by previous development permits shall not be given a credit unless they meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Credit for contributions, payments, construction or dedications of any impact fee component shall not be transferable to another component. Credit shall be transferable only within the same component and within the same development. 
(d)  The credit determination shall be made by the director of engineering and planning or his designee upon application. The application shall include: 
(1)  A drawing and legal description of the contributed or to be contributed land or improvement. 
(2)  An appraisal of the contributed or to be contributed land fixing value of the land as of the date of issuance of the earliest building permit, actual contribution or agreement to contribute, whichever is earliest. 
(3)  The actual cost, with appropriate documentation, or projected cost, with appropriate documentation, of any improvement contributed or to be constructed and contributed. 
(e)  If the application for credit is approved by the utility director or his designee, a credit agreement shall be prepared and signed by the applicant and the city. It shall specifically outline the contribution, payment, construction or land dedication, the time by which it shall be completed, dedicated, or paid, and any extensions thereof, and the dollar credit the applicant shall receive for the contribution, payment, construction or land. 
(f)  A determination by the utility director, or his designee, as to an application for credit may be appealed to the city commission.

Sec. 102-465. - Vested rights. 
(a)  A developer or successor in interest of land which has received a development permit may petition the city commission for a vested rights determination which would exempt the petitioner from the provisions of this article. Such petition shall be evaluated by the city attorney's office and a recommendation thereon submitted to the city commission based on the following criteria: 
(1)  There exists a valid, unexpired governmental act of authorizing the specific development for which a determination is sought. 
(2)  Expenditures or obligations have been made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing act that are reasonably equivalent to the fees required by this article. 
(3)  It would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development under the conditions of approval by requiring the developer to comply with the requirements of this article. For the purposes of this subsection, the following factors shall be considered in determining whether it would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development: 
a.  Whether the injury suffered by the petitioner outweighs the public cost of allowing the development to go forward without payment of the fee required by this article; 
b.  Whether the expenses or obligations were made or incurred subsequent to November 11, 1985, after which date the adoption of the ordinance codified in this article was pending; and 
c.  Whether the operation of this article would create an onerous burden which would prevent the petitioner from making a reasonable return on his investment. 
(b)  If a previously approved development contained conditions respecting impacts, impact fees and their designated uses, or improvements, the developer, or its successor, may request a modification of such prior approvals in order to bring the approval conditions into consistency with this article. Any such modification of prior approvals and amendments to development permits so accomplished shall not be deemed a substantial change under the city's planned unit development regulations or a substantial deviation under F.S. ch. 380. 
(Code 1973, § 28-147; Ord. No. 1845, § 1, 12-22-1986) 
Sec. 102-466. - Disposition and use of funds; return of unused funds. 
(a)  The impact fees collected by the city pursuant to this article shall be kept separate from other revenue of the city. The following trust fund accounts are hereby established: 
(1)  Water: One general account for citywide assessments. 
(2)  Sewer: One general account for citywide assessments. 
(b)  No impact fees shall be expended on a particular capital improvement pursuant to this article unless or until the city commission identifies sources of funds for right-of-way acquisition, construction of improvements or acquisition of capital facilities needed to overcome existing service deficiencies or a particular capital improvement which deficiency is not attributable to new growth and development, so as to ensure that impact fees are not utilized to correct existing deficiencies. 
(c)  The funds collected by reason of the establishment of the impact fees in accordance with this article shall be used solely for the purpose of acquisition, expansion and development of the capital assets determined to be needed to serve new development, to include the debt service, principal and interest of loans or parts of loans which were used solely for the purpose of acquisition, expansion and development of the capital assets determined to be needed to serve new development. 
(d)  All funds shall be used exclusively for the capital assets for which they were collected and in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors & Builders Association v. City of Dunedin , 329 So.2d 314 (Fla. 1976), Hollywood, Inc. v. Broward County , 431 So.2d 606 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983) cert. denied, 440 So.2d 352 (Fla. 1983), and Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County , 446 So.2d 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984), cert. denied, 451 So.2d 848 (Fla. 1984), and otherwise consistent with all requirements of the constitution of the United States and the state and all applicable laws. Such funds shall not be used to maintain or repair any existing facilities or to correct any existing deficiencies. 
(e)  Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of this section. The disbursal of such funds shall require the approval of the city commission upon recommendation of the city manager. 
(f)  Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in interest-bearing accounts. Funds may be pooled for investment provided all income derived from the funds' assets shall be deposited in the applicable trust account. 
(g)  The fees collected pursuant to this article shall be returned to the then-present owner of the development if the fees have not been encumbered or spent by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six years from the date the fees were received, or if the development for which the fees were paid was never begun, in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  The then-present owner must petition the city commission for the refund within one year following the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six years from the date on which the fee was received. 
(2)  The petition must be submitted to the city manager and must contain: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property or his authorized agent. 
b.  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee or other competent evidence of payment. 
c.  A certificate of title or attorney's title opinion showing the petitioner to be the current owner of the property or his authorized agent. 
d.  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill. 
e.  A copy of the building permit or development agreement pursuant to which the impact fees were paid.

ARTICLE XI. - RECLAIMED WATER REUSE PROGRAM 

Sec. 102-486. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to create a reclaimed water reuse program for the city. The purposes of the reclaimed water reuse program are to utilize highly treated reclaimed wastewater within the city environmentally suitable purposes; to conserve groundwater supplies for future generations by minimizing the use of potable water from groundwater sources by appropriate uses of reclaimed water; and to enhance the quality of surface water bodies in the Sanford vicinity by reducing discharge of reclaimed water to these water bodies to a minimum, as permitted for wet weather discharge by state department of environmental regulation. 
(b)  The city has elected to create a reclaimed water use program in order to reuse/dispose of highly treated reclaimed water by land application (irrigation) instead of discharge to Lake Monroe. To achieve necessary reuse, a distribution system for reclaimed water is being created within major portions of the existing municipal limits of the city. Funding for construction of the distribution system will be by a combination of utility bond funds and state department of environmental regulation grant monies. All cost-effective avenues for reuse will be utilized to handle existing reclaimed water flows. Reclaimed water flows resulting from new developments within the city shall be addressed in accordance with city development regulations (Schedule P), whereby developers/owners of new facilities shall generally be required to extend reclaimed water service mains as necessary to provide for reclaimed water reuse within their development at least up to the level of new wastewater flow to be generated. To encourage early commencement of reclaimed water reuse by existing city utilities customers, the city commission may, by resolution, temporarily amend or suspend various elements of the fee structure established in this article to encourage connection to the reclaimed water system.

(1)  Application procedures, forms, and requirements, and allowable uses other than irrigation. All uses must be in accordance with applicable state department of environmental regulation regulations. 
(2)  Installation requirements, including specification of acceptable materials, devices and regulations to prevent backflow or cross connections with other systems. 
(3)  Procedures for enforcement of the ordinances and regulations pertaining to reclaimed water, including procedures for inspection of the customer's system. 
(4)  Procedures for the orderly expansion of the reclaimed water system. 
(5)  Procedures and regulations for the efficient operation of the reclaimed water system. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city manager may, when necessary for the efficient operation of the reclaimed water system or for the health or safety of the general public or the customer, establish regulations regarding the following matters, which regulations shall become effective at the time of promulgation without the need for city commission approval: 
(1)  The time of day or night during which the reclaimed water may be used by customers. 
(2)  The maximum rate of use of the reclaimed water. 
(c)  No person shall construct, operate, maintain or allow to remain present, on property owned or controlled by him, any device or system which is connected to or which controls a device or system connected to the city's reclaimed water system and which is not in compliance with all provisions of the regulations of the state department of environmental regulation and this Code related to reclaimed water and with all procedures and regulations promulgated pursuant to this section. Reclaimed water shall not be directed or piped into any residence or building used as a dwelling unit. The person who owns or controls the property upon which such a noncomplying device or system is found shall be liable to the city for the amount by which the costs associated with the securing and/or removal of the noncomplying device or system exceeds the cost of a normal discontinuance of service. These excess costs shall constitute a lien against the property upon which the noncomplying device or system is located. 
(d)  Any customer whose reclaimed water system is in violation of any city ordinance, regulation or procedure shall be subject to immediate discontinuance of reclaimed water service as provided in section 102-491. Such discontinuance of service shall not relieve any person of liability for civil actions or for criminal or municipal ordinance violation prosecution.

(a)  A stormwater management utility fee may be imposed by separate resolution of the city commission upon all owners or occupants of each lot and parcel located within the city for services and facilities provided by the stormwater management utility program. For purposes of imposing the stormwater fee, all lots and parcels within the city shall be classified as residential, nonresidential, undeveloped platted or zoned for development, or undeveloped property. 
(b)  The city manager or his designee is directed to prepare a list of all lots and parcels within the city and assign a classification of residential, nonresidential, undeveloped platted or zoned for development, or undeveloped to each lot or parcel. Stormwater fees set by separate resolution of the city commission shall apply to all properties within the classification, including those properties designated as nonprofit, tax-exempt for ad valorem tax purposes, or owned or occupied by a governmental entity, including the city. 
(Code 1973, § 28-373; Ord. No. 3065, § 1, 7-8-1991) 
Sec. 102-569. - Establishment of fees. 
    Stormwater management utility fees shall be established by separate resolution of the city commission in accordance with the following classifications: 
(1)  Residential dwelling units. Each residential dwelling unit, regardless of residential class, shall be considered one equivalent residential unit (ERU) for billing purposes. The charge for one ERU shall be set at a flat rate by separate resolution of the city commission. For residential accounts not individually metered for water, the account holder of the master water meter shall be billed the fee established for one ERU multiplied by the number of residential units. 
(2)  Nonresidential customers. Each nonresidential customer shall be charged a stormwater fee based on the number of ERUs computed by using the following formula: 
No. of ERUs  =        Total impervious areas of each parcel       Average impervious area of 1.0 ERU  
A minimum value of 1.0 ERU shall be assigned to each nonresidential property. The charge for one ERU shall be set at a flat rate by separate resolution of the city commission. The total impervious area of each parcel of property shall be determined by the city manager or his designee. The average impervious area of one ERU shall be established by separate resolution of the city commission. 
(3)  Undeveloped, platted or zoned for development. The city commission may by separate resolution establish reasonable stormwater fees based on the number of equivalent residential units (ERU) that each parcel of property represents. 
(4)  Undeveloped. Stormwater fees shall not be charged for undeveloped property as defined in section 102-542. 
(Code 1973, § 28-374; Ord. No. 3065, § 1, 7-8-1991) 
Sec. 102-570. - Credits for on-site stormwater management facilities. 
(a)  Credits for on-site stormwater management facilities shall be allowed and calculated as follows: 
(1)  In order to encourage a reduction in stormwater runoff and improvement of the quality of stormwater runoff, a credit against the stormwater management utility fee is authorized for those developed properties which are served by a stormwater retention facility designed and constructed for the purpose of stormwater flow mitigation and pollution reduction, if it meets designated standards. Detention facilities are not eligible for the credit. 
(2)  A reduction in a stormwater fee may be allowed for a particular property only if the stormwater runoff from the property is served by a stormwater management facility that has been designed and constructed and is maintained properly for the purpose of stormwater flow mitigation and pollution reduction as measured against a defined standard established by the city. To be eligible for the stormwater retention credit, the facility must be constructed, owned, operated and maintained by other than the city. The facility must also be on land owned by other parties than the city and upon which there are no drainage easements dedicated to the public for the general purposes of drainage retention, flow mitigation or stormwater pollution abatement. 
(3)  For applicable properties, a credit may be calculated and the fee may be reduced based upon defined standards and a formula the city commission may establish by resolution from time to time. No property shall have a verified right to the use of any particular formula or fee reduction other than that established by the city commission by resolution. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to apply for the retention credit and supply all information needed to substantiate the credit under the defined standards, formula and procedures established by the city. The city manager or his designee shall be responsible for verifying or disallowing any fee reduction credit for a stormwater retention facility. 
(b)  In no event will the reduction in fee cause the fee to be paid to be less than 50 percent of the fee due without the credit. 
(Code 1973, § 28-375; Ord. No. 3065, § 1, 7-8-1991) 
Sec. 102-571. - Billing and collection of fee. 
(a)  The frequency of billing of the stormwater fee is to be established by the city manager based on an evaluation of the most efficient, effective and equitable method of billing and collections available to the utility. The stormwater fee shall be billed at least annually by the city, but no more than 12 times in one calendar year. The city manager is to assure that the most efficient and effective billing and collection techniques are being used. 
(b)  All stormwater fees not paid within 30 days after the bill is due, or that are not under active appeal, shall be considered delinquent. If such premises shall be served by the waterworks or sanitary sewer system of the city, the city shall cease to serve such premises with all utility services until all delinquent utility fees and interest have been paid. 
(c)  The stormwater fee shall constitute a debt to the city for which the owner, tenant and/or occupant shall be jointly and severally liable. The records of the city shall be kept open for the inspection by the owner, tenant or occupant, and it shall be the responsibility of the owner, tenant, or occupant to ascertain that the prescribed fees are paid. 
(d)  Charges which remain unpaid for a period of 60 days shall be a lien upon the property to which such fee is associated, as allowed by law, from the date the fee becomes due until the delinquent fee and interest are paid. The city commission may direct the city attorney to file suit thereon, by an action at law, to collect all such unpaid fees and interest, or a suit to enforce the lien in the same manner as the foreclosure of mortgages. In the event of either action, the city shall be entitled to recover the actual attorneys' fees and costs of the city for the collection. 
(e)  The city shall not be required to look to any person other than the owner for the payment of the delinquent fees and interest. The failure of any owner to learn that he purchased property against which a lien for delinquent fees exists shall in no way affect the property owner's responsibility for such payment. 
(Code 1973, § 28-376; Ord. No. 3065, § 1, 7-8-1991) 
Sec. 102-572. - Appeals. 
(a)  Any customer or property owner who feels that the stormwater fee or credit for his property has been calculated or computed incorrectly may petition in writing to the city manager or his designee for a review of their account. 
(b)  If not satisfied with the determination of the city manager or his designee, the petitioner may ask for a hearing before the city commission, whose decision shall be final. Any credits authorized by the appeal process shall only be effective against billings subsequent to the date of the appellate decision. 
(Code 1973, § 28-377; Ord. No. 3065, § 1, 7-8-1991) 
Sec. 102-573. - Trust fund. 
(a)  A stormwater management utility trust fund is hereby established, into which all revenues from user's fees, grants, or other funding sources shall be deposited and from which all expenditures related to the city's stormwater management utility shall be paid. Accounting and reporting procedures shall be consistent with state law and reported to the city commission by the city manager or his designee, annually. 
(b)  Expenditures for activities that are not related to the city's stormwater management utility shall not be permitted from the fund except for a prorated charge for general city government services as is in effect for other city utility funds. 
(Code 1973, § 28-378; Ord. No. 3065, § 1, 7-8-1991) 
Sec. 102-574. - Disclaimer of liability. 
    Floods from stormwater runoff may occur which exceed the capacity of storm drainage facilities constructed, operated, or maintained by funds made available under this article. This article shall not be construed or interpreted to mean that property subject to the fees and charges established in this article will always, or at any time, be free from stormwater flooding, standing water, water pollution or flood damage, or that stormwater control systems capable of handling all storm events can be cost-efficiently constructed, operated, or maintained. This article shall not create any liability on the part of, or cause of action against, the city, or any official or employee thereof, for any damage that may result from floods, storms, rains or the runoff thereof. This article does not purport to reduce the need or the necessity for obtaining flood insurance by individual property owners.

(a)  The facilities of the grantee shall be so located, relocated, installed, constructed and so erected as to not unreasonably interfere with the convenient, safe, continuous use or the maintenance, improvement, extension or expansion of any public "road" as defined under the Florida Transportation Code, nor unreasonably interfere with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property. 
(b)  To minimize such conflicts with the standards set forth in subsection 102-634(a), the location, relocation, installation, construction or erection of all facilities shall be made as representatives of the grantor may prescribe in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and pursuant to the grantor's valid rules and regulations with respect to utilities' use of public rights-of-way relative to the placing and maintaining, in, under, upon, along, over and across said public rights-of-way, provided, such rules and regulations shall be:

(4)  Shall not require relocation of any of the grantee's facilities installed before or after the effective date hereof in any public right-of-way unless or until the facilities unreasonably interfere with the convenient, safe, or continuous use, or the maintenance, improvement, extension, or expansion, of such public "road". 
(c)  Such rules and regulations shall recognize that above-grade facilities of the grantee installed after the effective date hereof should, unless otherwise permitted, be installed near the outer boundaries of the public rights-of-way to the extent possible and such installation shall be consistent with the Florida Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways. 
(d)  When any portion of a public right-of-way is excavated, damaged or impaired by grantee or any of its agents, contractors or subcontractors because of the installation, inspection, or repair of any of its facilities, the portion so excavated, damaged or impaired shall, within a reasonable time and as early as practicable after such excavation, be restored to its original condition before such damage by the grantee at its expense. 
(e)  In the event that the grantor requires removal or relocation of the grantee's facilities because the facilities unreasonably interfere with the standards set forth in subsection 102-634(a), and the grantee fails to remove or relocate such facilities at the grantee's expense within 30 days after written notice from the grantor, then the grantor may proceed to cause the facilities to be removed or relocated and all of the expenses therefore shall be charged against the grantee. 
(f)  The grantor shall not be liable to the grantee for any cost or expense incurred in connection with the relocation of any of the grantee's facilities required under this section, except, however, that the grantee may be entitled to reimbursement of its costs and expenses from others and as provided by law.

Sec. 102-637. - Franchise fee; calculation; payment. 
(a)  As a consideration for the nonexclusive right to use the grantor's public rights-of-way under this 2010 Electric Utility Franchise, the grantor's agreement to not compete with the grantee as set forth herein, and other valuable consideration all as set forth herein, as well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the grantee shall pay to the grantor a franchise fee, commencing 90 days after the effective date hereof, and each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this franchise, an amount which when added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees, charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem tax and non-ad valorem assessments on property) levied or imposed by the grantor against grantee's property, business or operations during the grantee's monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment will equal six percent of the grantee's billed revenues including fuel charges, less actual write-offs from the sale of electrical energy to residential, commercial and industrial customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff) within the incorporated areas of the grantor ("retail customers") for the monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall payment for the rights and privileges granted herein exceed six percent of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the grantee. The grantee shall continue to receive franchise payments under the currently existing and effective electric utility franchise during the period between the effective date of this franchise and the first payment hereunder. 
(b)  The grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the preceding paragraph are limited to the precise revenues described herein, and that such revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation:

    The grantor may, at its option, upon reasonable notice within 180 days to the grantee after each anniversary date of this franchise, at the sole expense of the grantor, examine the books and records of the grantee as such books and records relate to the calculation of the franchise fee payment to the grantor for the preceding such anniversary date. The grantee shall use a system of accounts and form of materials as prescribed by applicable law or regulation. The grantee shall attach to each payment to the grantor a statement of its gross revenues against which the franchise fee is to be calculated as to all retail customer accounts. Acceptance of payment by the grantor shall not estop the grantor from asserting that the amount paid is not the amount due. The grantee shall supply all accounts and records of the grantee that the grantor may reasonably request or require relative to calculating the franchise fee. Such examination of books and records of the grantee by the grantor shall be made during the regular business hours of the grantee at the general office of the grantee. Records not prepared by the grantee in the ordinary course of business may be provided at the grantor's expense and as the grantor and the grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not be taken from the grantee's premises. Such audit shall be impartial and all audit findings, whether they decrease or increase payment to the grantor, shall be reported to the grantee. The grantor's right to examine the records of the grantee in accordance with this section shall not be conducted by any third party employed by the grantor whose fee, in whole or part, for conducting such audit is contingent on findings of the audit. Records shall be retained by the grantee for a period of five years. The provisions of this section shall survive termination of this franchise.

(Ord. No. 4205, § 9, 5-24-2010) 
Sec. 102-640. - Non-competition by the grantor.

The grantor further agrees not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the purpose or terms of which would be to obligate the grantee to transmit and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third party(ies) other than governmental bodies, to any other retail customer's facility(ies). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit the grantor from engaging with other utilities or persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act. 6

(i)  From purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or 
(ii)  From seeking to have the grantee transmit and/or distribute to any facility(ies) of the grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the grantor from any other person; provided, however, that before the grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, the grantor shall notify the grantee. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the grantor's facilities to be served under the offer. The grantee shall thereafter have 90 days to evaluate the offer and, if the grantee offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, then the grantor shall be obligated to purchase from the grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the previously identified facilities of the grantor at the rates, terms and conditions offered by the grantee that are equal to or better than those offered by the other person for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. The grantor shall have a period of 60 days within which to accept the rates, terms and conditions offered by the grantee. In the event the grantor fails to accept such offered rates, terms and conditions offered by the grantee, then such offered rates, terms and conditions shall be deemed withdrawn and of no further force and effect. If the grantee does not agree to offer rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than the other person's offer within the 90-day period specified above, then the grantor may purchase such electric capacity and/or electric energy from such other person and all of the terms and conditions of this franchise shall remain in effect.

The grantee shall give the grantor at least 120 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein, advise the grantor of the consequences of such action which resulted in the material competitive disadvantage and the objective basis or bases of the material competitive disadvantage. The grantor shall then have 120 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the material competitive disadvantage. If such material competitive disadvantage is, in the reasonable determination of the grantee, not remedied by the grantor within said time period, the grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the grantor's city clerk and termination shall take effect on the date of delivery of such notice. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as constraining the grantor's rights to legally challenge at any time FPL's determination of material competitive disadvantage leading to termination hereunder.

Sec. 102-642. - Default by the grantee; forfeiture. 
    That failure on the part of the grantee to comply in any material respect with any of the provisions of this article, shall be grounds for a forfeiture of this grant, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by the grantee until a court of competent jurisdiction (with right of appeal in either party) shall have found that the grantee has failed to comply in a material respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the grantee shall have six months after the final determination of the question, to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right in the grantor at its discretion to grant such additional time to the grantee for compliance as necessitates in the case require.

(i)  Denying the grantee use of public rights-of-way for an improper reason as set forth herein; 
(ii)  Imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of this franchise; or 
(iii)  Unreasonable delay in issuing the grantee or its agents, contractors or subcontractor a permit to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, 
shall constitute breach of this franchise and entitle the grantee to withhold such portion of the payments provided for in this article as a court of competent jurisdiction determines to be equitable, just and reasonable under all the circumstances until such time as a permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has otherwise reached a final determination disposition of the matter. The parties recognize and agree that nothing in this franchise agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of their delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that each party may exercise such right in accordance with controlling law including, but not limited to, the doctrine of prior public use to the extent applicable. 
(Ord. No. 4205, § 13, 5-24-2010) 
Sec. 102-644. - Competitive disadvantage; termination by the grantee.

The grantee shall give the grantor at least 90 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein, advise the grantor of such terms and conditions that it considers materially more favorable and the objective basis or bases of same. The grantor shall then have 90 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive disadvantage complained of by the grantee. If the grantee reasonably determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the grantor within said time period, the grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the grantor's city clerk and termination shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice.

A newspaper of general circulation must be entered or qualified as second-class matter at a post office within Seminole County; shall have been in existence for one year or more; and shall be published periodically at least once a week or more often. 
B.  Special permit. 
1.  Upon application and after review as provided herein, the city commission may authorize as a special permit an exception to the otherwise applicable provisions of the currently effective city Comprehensive Plan or the city Land Development Regulations. The special permit shall be a development order for a specific type, level, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development of a specifically described parcel of real property. The special permit may be granted upon a finding by the city commission that the applicant has demonstrated, pursuant to the standards set forth in this section, that the applicant has a preexisting vested right to commence, maintain and complete a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity or other form of development. The special permit may be granted with or without conditions as may be appropriate considering the evidence adduced and reviewed before the city commission. 
2.  The special permit is not transferable, in whole or in part, to any other parcel of real property or to any other person, corporation, or other legal entity. 
C.  Considerations for determination of permit; demonstration of vested rights. 
1.  In determining whether a right to commence, maintain, and complete construction of a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity or other form of development has been vested, the following factors shall be considered: 
a.  Whether there has been an act or omission to act by the city; 
b.  Whether a city official acted or omitted to act and the personnel rank, official position and authority of that official; 
c.  Whether the city official acted or omitted to act within the course and scope of his/her personnel rank, authority and official position; 
d.  The nature of the act committed and date thereof, or the nature of the omission to act and approximate date thereof; 
e.  Whether the applicant made a substantial change in position, or has an investment-backed expectation, based upon the city's act or omission to act; 
f.  The nature of the applicant's change in position or investment-backed expectation, including expenditure of money or obligation to expend funds, amounts thereof, dates of expenditures; or incurrence of the obligation to incur expenditures, acts committed which represent a change in position, and dates thereof; 
g.  The good faith of the applicant in substantially changing his/her position, or the incurring of extensive obligations and expenses based upon the city's actions or omissions to act; 
h.  Any legally permitted acts of the applicant and the specific dates thereof associated with physical improvements on the land or for the design of specific buildings and improvements to be constructed on the site; 
i.  The extent to which the applicant has secured building permits for, and commenced in whole or in part, but not completed, the construction of physical improvements on the land, utility infrastructure or other public improvements or buildings germane to a phased development that was contemplated to extend over a period of months or years; 
j.  Whether the applicant prior to or on the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation has made contractual commitments to complete structures and deliver titles thereto or occupancy thereof, and the dates of and amounts of money involved in those commitments; 
k.  Whether prior to, or on, the date of notice of change in a land development regulation for the currently effective Comprehensive Plan, Land Development Regulations, or applicable section of either document, the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution, which, despite a thorough review of alternative solutions, the applicant will be unable to meet, or it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet, unless he is permitted to proceed with the previously permitted specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development; 
l.  Whether enforcement of the terms of the currently effective comprehensive plan or land development code regulation will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability to third persons, or will leave the applicant completely unable, after thorough review of alternative solutions, to earn a reasonable return on his/her investment in the property; 
m.  Whether the right of the applicant to commence, maintain, and complete the proposed development, or a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development has been vested only with respect to an identifiable and discreet portion of the applicant's property; and 
n.  Any other information relevant to understanding the applicant's claim to vested rights to develop his/her/its real property in a particular manner that may be pertinent under state or federal law. 
2.  The right of the applicant to commence, maintain, or complete construction of a development or to a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development on his/her/its parcel of real property, or a portion thereof, is vested if the applicant can demonstrate that: 
a.  The applicant owned the parcel of real property proposed to be developed on the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation, and that the specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development proposed for the parcel of real property was lawful and legally permitted at that time; 
b.  The applicant has continuously owned the parcel of real property since the date of notice of a change in a land development regulation until the date of the public hearing before the city commission on the special permit application; 
c.  The most current legislated city Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Regulations, or portion thereof, cited by the applicant as being counter to the applicant's vested right to commence, maintain, and complete construction of a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development, has a material and adverse effect upon the applicant's vested right to develop the subject parcel or continue the use of real property as contemplated; 
d.  By application of the considerations set out in this section, the applicant in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made such a substantial change in position it has an investment-backed expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence, maintain, and complete a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development upon all or a portion of the applicant's parcel of real property; and 
e.  The requirement that the applicant's property be developed in accordance with the currently effective city Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Regulations, will deprive the applicant of a reasonable rate of return on his/her investment or effectuate a substantial change in position, given the substantial change in position of the applicant or the creation of an investment-backed expectation prior to or on the date on which the most current city Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Regulations, was subject to a notice of a change. In determining the reasonableness of the projected rate of return, the following categories of expenditures shall not be included in the calculation of the applicant's investment: 
(1)  Expenditures for professional services that are unrelated to the design or construction of the contemplated improvements proposed; 
(2)  Expenditures for taxes, except for any increases in tax expenditures which result from issuance of a development order which would now be contrary to the currently existing city comprehensive plan or land development code; and 
(3)  Expenditures which the applicant would have been obligated to incur as ordinary and necessary business expenses including, but not limited to employees' salaries, equipment rental, chattel mortgage payments. 
f.  The fact that the property has been or is in a particular zoning or comprehensive plan district or classification under the currently effective city comprehensive plan or land development code, or any prior city comprehensive plan or zoning ordinance of the city, shall not, in and of itself, establish that an applicant's right to commence, maintain, and complete construction of a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development has been vested. 
D.  Application process. 
1.  Any person, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity having an ownership interest in a parcel of real property may file an application for a special permit within six months of the effective date of the amendatory ordinance that rezones, changes the land use of the property, or otherwise materially and adversely affects the applicant's parcel of land (or portion thereof) so as to prohibit the specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development, in whole or in part, or vested rights shall be deemed to have been waived. 
2.  The application shall be filed with the city clerk who shall, upon receipt of the same, stamp the application with the date and time. The application shall contain: 
a.  A concise and complete recital of the facts, including dates of expenditures or obligation to expend funds, dollar amounts, the nature of expenditures or obligation to expend funds, and other factors which are claimed to support the claim to a vested right to commence, maintain, and complete a specific level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development; 
b.  A legal description of the parcel of real property and a survey, if available, thereof upon which the applicant claims to have vested development rights; 
c.  The applicant's name, address, and telephone number, email address and fax number;

f.  A complete description of the extent and quality of ownership of the real property during that period; 
g.  An affidavit under penalty of perjury executed by the applicant before a notary public attesting to the truth, accuracy, and veracity of the application based on the applicant's personal knowledge and all attachments thereto; and 
h.  Such other information relevant to the standards and matters germane to this section as the director of planning and development services may specify. 
3.  An application fee as shall be established by a resolution of the city commission from time to time. 
4.  Within 14 days of submission, the city manager will determine whether the petition is technically complete and will accept it or request corrections. A technically incomplete application shall be returned to the applicant with written notification of the deficient items. The applicant shall be granted 14 additional calendar days to complete this application. If a response is not submitted to the city manager within the time specified, the application shall be deemed abandoned. 
5.  Within 30 calendar days of determining that an application is technically complete, the city manager shall schedule a public hearing before the city commission to review the application and the city commission makes a final determination as to whether or not vested rights have been clearly and convincingly demonstrated. 
6.  Within seven calendar days after making a final determination of vested rights status, the city commission shall provide the applicant with written notification of the determination of vested rights status. If the city commission determines that vested rights exist the applicant shall have the right to rely upon such written determination and the determination shall be final. 
7.  Any determination by the city commission with respect to vested rights and the issuance of a special permit under this section shall expire and be of no further force or effect, unless construction is actually commenced on the parcel of real property within one year of the date that the order granting the special permit is filed with the city clerk.

Section 4.2. - Amendments to zoning district map. 
    The zoning district map may be amended from time to change the zoning districts within the incorporated area of the city in accordance with the following procedures: 
A.  Origination of proposed amendments. Proposed amendments to the zoning district map changing the zoning district within the incorporated area of the City of Sanford, Florida, may originate by resolution of the city commission, the planning and zoning commission or by application of the owners of 51 percent or more of the land area involved in the proposed change. 
Proposals originating with the city commission or the planning and zoning commission must be reflected in an appropriate resolution of the originating body and a copy of such resolution, upon adoption, shall be filed with the administrative official.

Upon receipt of an application for amendment to the zoning district map pursuant to this section and reference thereof to the planning and zoning commission, the administrative official shall, upon notification by the chairman of the planning and zoning commission of the date fixed for a hearing, cause notices of the time, place and purpose of a hearing upon the application to be published, mailed and posted in the manner provided in section 3.8.D of the land development regulations. At the time and date established by such notice, the planning and zoning commission shall conduct a hearing upon the application in the manner provided by section 3.8.E and F of the land development regulations and, shall recommend adoption or denial of the application to the city commission provided, however, that in the case of a proposed planned development project plan, the planning and zoning commission shall recommend adoption, adoption with modifications and/or conditions or denial of the application to the city commission. 
D.  Action by city commission. Following hearing by the planning and zoning commission, the administrative official shall submit the proposed amendment to the zoning district map, with the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, to the city commission for consideration. No proposal to amend the zoning district map shall be permitted to be withdrawn by the applicant from and after the date on which the planning and zoning commission makes its recommendation to the city commission regarding such proposed amendment. 
The city commission shall consider and act upon such application and the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission in the manner prescribed by law for the adoption of ordinances by the city commission and thereafter adopt or refuse to adopt such proposed amendment. 
In acting upon a proposal to amend the zoning district map, the city commission may approve a more restrictive zoning designation than the designation proposed in the application including, but not limited to, the planned development zoning classification. 
E.  Development order required for zoning map amendment with planned development project. The zoning map shall be amended by ordinance executed by the city commission which shall grant the application for an amendment. In addition, all zoning map amendments which include planned development projects shall be approved by a written development order in the form specified in section 3.12.E. 
F.  Special requirements respecting amendment to zoning district. No amendment to change the zoning district of a specific parcel of land to a zoning district different from the zoning district of adjoining property shall be adopted unless the specific parcel of land involved in the proposed change has 75 feet or more of street frontage and 10,000 square feet or more of land area, provided however, that the zoning map may be amended so that a parcel of land may be added to an existing adjacent zoning district regardless of the size of the parcel or its street frontage. 
G.  Finality of decision. Whenever the city commission has taken action to deny a proposed amendment to the zoning district map originating upon application of the owners of 51 percent or more of the property involved in the proposed change, unless such denial is specifically without prejudice to reapplication, no other application by the owners of such land for amendment to the zoning district map respecting such land shall be accepted by the administrative official for consideration by the planning and zoning commission or city commission for a period of one year from the date of the action denying the proposed amendment provided, however, that an applicant may request and the city commission may waive the provisions of this section for proper cause after hearing in conformity with the provisions of section 3.8.G.

Article V - VARIANCES AND APPEALS 

Section 5.1. - Variances. 
A.  Applicability. A modification to the terms and development standards of schedules C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, S and U may be granted where a variance would relieve a practical difficulty or undue hardship caused by a strict application of the regulations after a finding that the proposed variance is consistent with the standards enumerated below. It shall be the burden of the applicant to prove, by substantial competent evidence, compliance with said standards. 
Under no circumstance shall the provisions of this section be construed to mean that any provisions, requirements and/or regulations contained within the land development regulations can be waived or reduced which may reasonably be complied with by the applicant. 
B.  Standards for consideration for variances. Before any variance may be granted, the planning and zoning commission or administrative official shall find that the variance would relieve a practical difficulty or undue hardship caused by a strict application of the regulations provided that the variance is occasioned by: 
1.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district. 
2.  The literal interpretation of the provisions of the land development regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of the land development regulations. 
3.  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
4.  Granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the land development regulations to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. 
5.  The reasons set forth in the application justify granting the variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure. 
6.  The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the land development regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
C.  Authority to grant a variance. The following are authorized to grant variances: 
1.  The planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to grant a variance for multiple-family dwellings, non-residential land uses, and all other land uses except as noted below. 
2.  The administrative authority shall have authority to grant a variance for one-family dwellings and two-family dwellings located in residential zoning districts (SR-1AA, SR-1A, SR-1 and SR-2) after a review and recommendation by the development review team. 
3.  The administrative official shall have the authority to grant a de minimus variance of 15 percent or less of any standard or term included in a schedule referenced above for all land uses including one-family and two-family dwellings. 
In granting any variance, the planning and zoning commission or the administrative official may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with these regulations. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of and punishable under these regulations. 
The planning and zoning commission or the administrative official shall prescribe a time limit, which in no event shall be greater than one year, within which the action for which the variance is required shall be begun and diligently pursued to completion thereafter without cessation of 30 days or greater. 
Under no circumstances shall the planning and zoning commission or the administrative official grant a variance to allow a use not permissible in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of these regulations in said district. 
D.  Procedures for variance approval. An owner or his authorized agent seeking a variance as permitted by this section must make application in accordance with the following procedures: 
1.  Application. All applications for variances shall be in the form required and provided by the administrative official. Such application shall be submitted to the administrative official together with the application fee established in the manner prescribed in the land development regulations.

A "complete application" includes the application form, the application fee and all required supplemental data and information. 
All applications requesting a reduction in required dimensions shall be accompanied by a survey of the parcel prepared by a surveyor registered in the State of Florida. 
2.  De minimus variances. Upon receipt of an application for a variance of 15 percent or less, the administrative official may approve, approve with conditions or deny the application. The administrative official shall prepare a development order pursuant to section 5.01 D. 4. b. of this article for those applications that are approved or approved with conditions. The development order shall find that the standards for variances have been satisfied and that the variance being granted is the minimum variance required in order to make possible the reasonable use of the land, structures and other improvements. De minimus variances do not require noticing or a public hearing. 
The administrative official shall have the discretion to require that an application for a de minimus variance be heard by the planning and zoning commission at a public hearing. 
3.  Single-family and two-family variances of greater than 15%. For single-family and two-family uses, the variance application shall be reviewed by the development review team which shall make a recommendation to the administrative authority based on a finding that the proposed variance is consistent or inconsistent with the standards for variances as set for in subsection B of this section. The administrative authority shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the variance. 
The administrative official shall prepare a development order pursuant to section 5.1 D. 4. e. of this article for those applications that are approved or approved with conditions.

The written development order shall be incorporated into the minutes of the meeting at which such action occurred. 
f.  Effect and limitation of approved order. An order granting a conditional use or variance, and a site development permit or certificate of completion issued pursuant thereto, shall be deemed applicable to the parcel for which it is granted and not to the individual applicant provided that no order or site development permit or certificate of completion issue thereto shall be deemed valid with respect to any use of the premises other than that specified in the approved application. 
g.  Recording of the development order. No development order approving, or approving with conditions, a variance or a conditional use shall become effective until said development order is recorded in the official records of Seminole County.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Cross reference- Buildings and building regulations, ch. 18; floods, ch. 46; planning and development, ch. 74. 

Section 6.1. - Intent of subdivision plan review. 
A.  Intent. The intent of subdivision plan review is to: 
1.  Set forth uniform procedures, well-defined application processes and information requirements that ensure that the subdivision of land within the City of Sanford is consistent with all applicable minimum development standard; 
2.  Ensure that the approval of such subdivisions will be based upon the provision and availability of adequate public facilities and services coincident with the impact of the subdivision's development; and 
3.  Ensure that the subdivision is compatible and coordinated with existing and anticipated development within the immediate area surrounding the site. 
B.  Subdivision plan process. Subdivision plan review usually includes three steps: 
1.  Preliminary subdivision plan review; 
2.  Improvement plan review; and 
3.  Final plat approval. 
    When applicable, a fourth step, master plan review, is also required. Each of the review processes are intended to define the relationship and differentiate between overall and specific subdivision design considerations, technical engineering and construction requirements and platting requirements. In this regard, preliminary subdivision plan review and master plan review shall generally be completed upon action or decision of the planning and zoning commission. Improvement plan review shall generally be completed upon action or decision of the administrative official. Final plat approval shall result upon action by the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 4103, § 1, 4-28-2008) 
Section 6.2. - Applicability of subdivision plan review. 
    Compliance with the subdivision review procedures and requirements set forth in the land development regulations shall be required prior to one or more of the following actions: 
A.  The division of land into three or more parcels; 
B.  The dedication of streets or easements to the City of Sanford; or 
C.  The provision of access or utilities to a lot, tract or use by means of a right-of-way or easement established after July 27, 1992. 
(Ord. No. 4103, § 1, 4-28-2008) 
Section 6.3. - Exemptions to subdivision plan review. 
    The following types of land divisions are excepted from preliminary subdivision plan review; provided, however, that any owner or the owner's authorized agent who desires to alter the dimensions, land area or boundaries of any lot, parcel or tract for the purpose of sale, lease or other transfer of interest shall first provide such plans and information to the administrative official as the administrative official deems necessary in order to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the land development regulations: 
A.  Rearrange existing lots or tracts in an existing subdivision for the purpose of constructing one-family dwellings to be located on one lot or tract per dwelling unit when all lots, tracts or parcels have frontage on existing streets. 
B.  Lot or tract splits when the division of a parcel does not result in the creation of more than two lots or tracts, all lots or tracts have frontage on an existing public street right-of-way and only one such lot or tract split may occur for a parcel or parcels under common ownership or interest or the successors of such ownership or interest within a period of five years. 
C.  Dedication of an easement for drainage or utilities or dedication of land for public road right-of-way as a condition of development plan approval provided that such dedication does not occur in conjunction with an accessway to a lot, tract or use. 
(Ord. No. 4103, § 1, 4-28-2008) 
Section 6.4. - Minor subdivision plan review. 
    The minor subdivision plan review procedure is intended for small-scale development that does not involve construction of extensive infrastructure. The city desires to encourage logical parcelization of land while eliminating costly and time-consuming procedures for such small-scale development. Specifically, the administrative official shall have the authority to permit an applicant to undergo minor subdivision review procedures for division of land into a maximum of five parcels or lots. Application procedures for minor subdivision plan review shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, compliance with final plat procedures and requirements set forth in this article. The administration official shall have the authority to require any and all stipulations and conditions deemed necessary. 
    A pre-application conference with the administrative official is required to determine if the proposed parcelization concept complies with the intent and purpose of minor subdivision plan review procedures outlined above. The applicant shall present a current survey and legal description of the property and a general concept of the proposed subdivision including a layout and additional information as may be necessary to explain the proposal. The administrative official has the authority to determine whether the proposed subdivision is consistent with the intent and purpose of minor subdivision plan review.

The preliminary subdivision plan and supplementary materials shall be in the form prescribed in section 6.5. No application will be accepted unless it is complete. Acceptance does not mean approval. The administrative official will advise the applicant of whether the proposed preliminary subdivision plan is accepted or not accepted. If the proposed preliminary subdivision plan is not accepted, the administrative official shall inform the applicant in writing of one or more reasons for denial of acceptance of the preliminary subdivision plan. Failure by the administrative official to specify one or more reasons for denying the acceptance of a preliminary subdivision plan application does not preclude such reasons being specified in denying any reapplication for such plan. The administrative official may reject a preliminary subdivision plan application or reapplication by reason of lack of clarity or readability. Plans stating "Not For Construction," "For Review Only," or any such similar wording shall not be accepted. 
Preliminary subdivision plans must be coordinated, as appropriate, with the City of Lake Mary, Seminole County, the Seminole County School Board, other special districts, the Sanford Historic Preservation District, the Sanford Airport Authority, the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC), the St. Johns River Water Management District, as well as applicable state and federal agencies prior to issuance of a development order or permit.

Section 7.5. - Variances. 
    Any applicant may request a variance from the requirements of Schedules M, N, O, and P. Such request for a variance shall comply with the requirements and procedures set forth in this section. 
A.  Application to administrative official. Applications for a variance shall be submitted to the administrative official. The administrative official shall have the authority to require that submittal of such application be coincident with any other related application or request set forth in the land development regulations including, but not limited to, development plan review and subdivision plan review. The form of the request shall be acceptable to the administrative official and shall comply with the following requirements: 
1.  The request shall be in written form. 
2.  The request shall accompany the proposed plan in question. 
3.  The request shall identify the requirement or provision that is proposed to be modified and shall fully explain the reasons that such variance should be permitted. 
4.  The administrative official has the authority to accept or reject such request based on reasonableness. 
B.  Administrative official action upon technical questions. Upon acceptance of a request by an applicant as set forth above, the administrative official shall have the authority to act upon a request for a variance when such request is primarily of a technical nature. Such request must involve a technical specification or requirement such as, but not limited to, the type of materials, type or manner of application of materials, installation sequence, material performance, construction technique or requirement for specific construction feature. Further, the variance must not constitute a policy question. Copies of all granted variances shall be provided to the city commission, city manager and the planning and zoning commission. 
In granting a variance, the administrative official must make specific affirmative findings respecting each of the matters specified in subsection C. and may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, including requirements in excess of those otherwise required by the land development regulations, which shall become a part of the terms under which a site development permit and certificate of completion shall issue. 
The administrative official may refer any request for a variance to the development review team for recommendation. The administrative official may decline to rule upon a variance application and process the application in accordance with the provisions relating to policy decisions. 
C.  Standards for consideration of a variance. Before any variance may be granted, the following findings shall be determined: 
1.  That the literal interpretation of the provisions of the land development regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties located in the immediate area of subject property under the terms of the land development regulations and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
2.  That granting the variance will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges denied by the land development regulations to other lands, buildings or structures located in the immediate area of the subject property. 
3.  That the variance provides for equal or better performance than the stated requirement in the land development regulations. The administrative official may require a performance guarantee in the manner set forth in the land development regulations and/or engineering under signature and seal of a licensed professional engineer in the State of Florida to insure such performance. 
4.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the land development regulations and that such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the short-term or long-term public interest or welfare. 
5.  That the granting of the variance will be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and will not adversely impact the established level of service for any facilities or services set forth in said Comprehensive Plan. 
D.  Administrative official action and referral upon policy question. If the request for a variance involves a requirement or provision that is not determined to be a technical requirement by the administrative official, such a request for a variance shall be regarded as a policy question. The administrative official shall have the authority to refer requests for a variance regarding a policy question to the planning and zoning commission and/or the city commission for action. 
1.  Referral to planning and zoning commission. When the request for a variance does not involve improvements that are dedicated, owned or maintained by a public entity, the administrative official has the authority to transmit such request for a variance to the planning and zoning commission for action in conjunction with the subject plan or application involved in the request for a variance. 
2.  Referral to city commission. When the request for a variance involves improvements that are to be dedicated, owned or maintained by a public entity, the administrative official has the authority to transmit such request for a variance to the city commission for action in conjunction with the subject plan or application involved in the request for a variance. Action upon a request for a variance involving improvements to be dedicated to the public must be by action of the city commission. 
3.  Action upon variance. In granting such request for a variance, the planning and zoning commission and/or the city commission must make specific affirmative findings respecting each of the matters specified in subsection C., and may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, including requirements in excess of those otherwise required by the land development regulations, which shall become a part of the terms under which a site development permit and certificate of completion shall issue. 
Article VIII - CONCURRENCY PROCEDURES 

Section 8.1. - Concurrency management administrative procedures. 
A.  General. Concurrency is a finding that the public facilities and services necessary to support a proposed development are available, or will be made available, concurrent with the impacts of the development. The provisions of this article are designed to provide a systematic process for the review and evaluation of the impact of all proposed development on concurrency facilities, as required by the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, F.S. ch. 163, pt. II [F.S. § 163.3161 et seq.], and F.A.C. 9J-5.0055. 
B.  Concurrency facilities defined. Concurrency facilities are defined as and include: 
1.  Roadways; 
2.  Potable water facilities; 
3.  Sanitary sewer facilities; 
4.  Solid waste facilities; 
5.  Recreation and open space facilities; 
6.  Drainage facilities. 
C.  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to ensure that development orders and permits are conditioned on the availability of concurrency facilities which meet adopted level of service requirements described in Schedule Q. Schedule Q cites level of service requirements and methods of calculating facility capacity governing concurrency determination. Further, in order to insure certainty in the development process, this article provides procedures and mechanisms to reserve capacity for concurrency facilities. 
Section 8.2. - Applicability and exemptions. 
A.  Applicability. All applicants for development approval shall submit any information, data and analysis deemed necessary by the administrative official to conduct a concurrency review. 
B.  Exemptions. All applicants for development shall be subject to concurrency review unless specifically exempted below: 
1.  Projects below the minimum threshold. The following development shall be exempt from concurrency management reviews: 
a.  Residential projects which would result in the creation of one additional single-family dwelling or one two-family dwelling as well as structural alterations, including room additions which do not change the land use; 
b.  Nonresidential change of use or expansion projects of up to ten percent of the existing gross floor area, providing such change of use or expansion is estimated to generate less than 120 vehicle trips per day and create one equivalent residential unit of utility demand or less. Trip generation data shall be pursuant to the latest edition of the publication entitled: Trip Generation, Institute of Transportation Engineers, or as hereinafter updated and amended. 
c.  In no case, however, shall a development order be issued for a minimum threshold project which would impact a public facility for which a moratorium or deferral on development has been placed. 
d.  Construction of accessory buildings and structures which do not create additional public facility demand. 
e.  Other developments which do not increase capacity of concurrency facilities, such as grading or excavation of land or structural alterations which do not include a change of use and satisfy provisions of (a) and (b) above. 
2.  Vested projects. Projects which have valid development orders or permits prior to the effective date of this article, shall be exempt from concurrency management. This shall include the following: 
a.  Any project for which a building permit has been issued and for which the building permit has not expired and construction has commenced prior to the expiration of the building permit; 
b.  All vacant single-family detached, single-family attached and two-family dwelling lots in subdivisions which were platted and recorded prior to the effective date of this article; 
c.  All vacant nonresidential lots in subdivisions which were platted and recorded prior to the effective date of this article, provided however, only one principal building and one land use shall be permitted per lot or tract; 
d.  Any subdivision for which the preliminary subdivision plan has been approved prior to the effective date of this article and which approval has not expired; 
e.  Any project zoned PD, Planned Development, for which a master plan has been approved prior to the effective date of this article; 
f.  Any project for which a development plan has been approved prior to the effective date of this article and which approval has not expired; 
g.  Approved developments of regional impact with a development order that has not expired; and 
h.  Any project for which the city commission approves as a vested project pursuant to procedures set forth in the article. 
3.  Redevelopment projects. Proposed redevelopment shall be credited for 110 percent capacity of the existing project. If a redevelopment project generates capacity in excess of 110 percent of the existing project, a concurrency review shall be required; however, the concurrency review shall only be directed to the capacity generated which exceeds the capacity of prior existing development. Capacity determination shall be conducted at the time of demolition permit application. The proposed development generates less traffic than the existing project, the applicant for concurrency review shall be given a concurrency credit memorandum within 30 days of the concurrency evaluation which enables the applicant to reapply for the unused capacity. The concurrency credit memorandum will expire within five years of its issuance. The applicants submission of an application for a demolition permit shall initiate the concurrency review for the express purpose of issuing credits for redevelopment. 
4.  Public facilities. Public facilities necessary to ensure the protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Sanford, including public schools (pre-kindergarten through 12th grade), shall be exempt from concurrency review. This shall include all public facility construction projects included in the city's capital improvements program required to meet any adopted level of service standard. 
5.  Transportation concurrency exception area. Transportation concurrency requirements shall not apply to development or redevelopment within the transportation concurrency exception area as depicted on Map II-8 of the 2001 City of Sanford Comprehensive Plan, provided that the development or redevelopment project complies with the standards and requirements of subsection 4.0 of Schedule Q of the land development regulations. 
Section 8.3. - Criteria for concurrency and final development orders. 
A.  Final development order. Final development orders include site development permits, building permits and development orders or agreements. A final development order shall only be granted for a proposed development based upon a finding that all public facilities and services included in this article have sufficient capacity at or above their adopted level of service (LOS) to accommodate the impacts of the development, or that improvements necessary to bring facilities up to their adopted LOS will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the development, as defined herein. 
B.  Compliance. The following criteria must be met in order to comply with concurrency management requirements: 
1.  The necessary concurrency facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued, or a development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place by a specified date when the impacts of the development are anticipated to occur; or 
2.  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a development permit is issued; or 
3.  The necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued; or 
4.  The necessary facilities and services have been included in the capital improvements program and are programmed for construction prior to or concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development; or 
5.  In the case of road facilities, the necessary improvements are committed in the first three years of the applicable adopted Florida Department of Transportation Five-Year Work Program, or the Seminole County Five-Year Transportation Plan. 
6.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380, or any other development agreement entered into between the city and a development. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place prior to or concurrent with the impacts of the development. 
Section 8.4. - Concurrency administration. 
    The administrative official shall be responsible for concurrency reviews as required by this article. Concurrency determination shall be based on a numerical review performed by the administrative official based on information provided by the applicant. The administrative official shall make a non-binding determination of whether sufficient capacities in public facilities and services are available to satisfy the demands of each proposed development. 
A.  Application for concurrency review. Concurrency review shall be initiated upon submission and acceptance of an application for a planned development project master plan, a site plan and/or a preliminary subdivision plan. An applicant may request a concurrency review upon making application in an acceptable form to the administrative official. At the request of the applicant and pursuant to payment of a fee established in the manner set forth in this ordinance, the administrative official may issue a non-binding letter of concurrency findings. 
B.  Project impact assessment. The administrative official shall use the best available information to establish and evaluate existing capacities for concurrency facilities. The applicant shall be responsible for calculating the anticipated impacts of a proposed development. The administrative official shall assess the impacts of the proposed development against existing conditions. 
C.  Project phasing/timing of improvements. Public facility improvements associated with a phase development may likewise be phased, provided that all public facility improvements necessary to accommodate the impacts of the entire development are to be provided and a schedule established for their construction prior to the issuance of a final development order. The schedule of facility improvements shall ensure that all facility improvements necessary to accommodate the impacts of the development (or portion thereof) for which a certificate or completion or certificate of occupancy has been applied, shall be in place prior to the issuance of the certificate. Under no circumstances shall the final certificate of occupancy or completion be issued for a project unless all required facility improvements required by the development order or development agreement have been completed. 
D.  Development agreements. If the minimum requirements for concurrency as outlined in article IX cannot be met, concurrency may be achieved by guaranteeing necessary facility improvements in an enforceable development agreement, as permitted by article IX. Said development agreement may include guarantees to construct required facility improvements, or to provide funds equivalent to the cost of providing such facility improvements. 
The terms and schedules of all investment reimbursement programs shall be set forth in a binding development agreement. 
E.  Concurrency findings. Upon the conclusion of the concurrency review, the administrative official shall prepare a written set of findings concerning the proposed development. These findings shall include, but are not limited to: 
1.  The anticipated public facility impacts of the proposed development; 
2.  The ability of existing facilities to accommodate the proposed development at the adopted level of service standards; 
3.  Any existing facility deficiencies that will need to be corrected prior to the completion of the proposed development; 
4.  The facility(s) improvement or additions necessary to accommodate the impact of the proposed development at the adopted level(s) of service standard(s) and the entity(s) responsible for the design and installation of all required facility improvements or additions; and 
5.  The date such facility(s) improvement or additions will need to be completed to be concurrent with the impacts on such facility(s) created by the proposed development. 
Section 8.5. - Capacity reservation. 
A.  Reservation of capacity. If the administrative official determines that the capacity of public facilities is equal to or greater than that required to maintain the adopted level of service for said facilities, the applicant may request a reservation of capacity. Upon receipt of an application for capacity reservation in a form acceptable to the administrative official, the administrative official shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the capacity reservation application. The administrative official shall issue a letter of capacity reservation which shall state applicable findings, conditions, stipulations and appropriate information. A letter of capacity reservation shall be required prior to a final development order. A letter of capacity reservation does not represent overall development approval and shall not release a recipient of such letter from all other applicable provisions of the land development regulations. The city commission shall establish fees in the manner set forth in this ordinance to be paid by the applicant in order to reserve facility capacity. Said fees shall set forth time frames for final reservation of capacity and provisions for extensions. 
B.  First come, first served. Letters of capacity reservation shall be issued on a first come, first served basis by the administrative official. Letters of capacity reservation shall be valid only for the specific land uses, densities, intensities, construction and improvement schedules contained in the application. Letters of capacity reservation run with the land and are transferable to a successor in ownership. Reservation of capacity for concurrency shall expire if the underlying development order or development agreement expires or is revoked. 
C.  Forfeiture of capacity reservation. In the event all capacity of a concurrency facility has been reserved through letters of capacity reservation, the administrative official shall have the authority to review all letters of capacity reservation, beginning with the longest standing such letter. If the administrative official determines that the development has not proceeded in "good faith," the administrative official may recommend to the city commission that the letter of capacity reservation be forfeited. If the city commission shall, with due public notice and notification of the owner or applicant, hold a public hearing to determine whether the letter of capacity reservation shall or shall not be forfeited and whether a refund shall be made. If the longest standing development order holding a letter of capacity reservation has proceeded in good faith, then the next longest standing letter of concurrency reservation shall be reviewed by the administrative official, and so on. This system will proceed until a determination is made as to whether previous development orders with a letter of capacity reservation have proceeded in good faith. 
D.  Project deferrals/development moratoriums. If, at any time the city's inventory of public facilities capacities indicates that a public facility has dropped below its adopted level of service standard, the city shall cease to issue development orders for projects which would impact the deficient facility(s) or area of facility operations, as defined within this ordinance. Such a suspension or moratorium on the issuance of development orders shall continue until such time as the adopted standard is reestablished or the Comprehensive Plan is amended to reflect an acceptable level of service standard for the facility(s) in question. 
E.  Concurrency denials. In the event that the city's concurrency review reveals that the proposed development would generate public facility impacts beyond that which can be absorbed by available capacity, the city shall ensure that there is a financial or other legally binding commitment to ensure that public facilities necessary to correct the anticipated deficiency will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. Should the city and/or a developer be unable to provide such assurances, the project shall be denied. The administrative official may place projects denied due to failure to meet concurrency requirements, but for which all other land development requirements have been met, on a prioritized list for approval of development orders once facility improvements have been made. 
Section 8.6. - Investment reimbursement plan for construction of new public facilities. 
A.  Authorization. The administrative official is authorized to negotiate and establish within a development agreement for approval by the city commission an investment reimbursement plan. When it is required that a developer funds the cost of infrastructure or public facilities improvements in order to support the proposed development concurrent with the impacts of the development and pursuant to the concurrency management system and the developer is also required to provide or fund additional capacity in the system to accommodate other future development in the area or fund a facility that will be regularly utilized by other future developments the developer may be eligible to participate in an equitable system of investment reimbursement to recover a portion of the costs incurred in the installation of the facilities according to the provisions of this section. 
B.  Applicability. This section shall apply to any developer who is required to fund public roadways, potable water facilities, sanitary sewer facilities, water facilities and/or drainage facilities that may be used or shared in the future by the developers and owners of other parcels of land in the vicinity. 
C.  Establishment of investment reimbursement fund. The administrative official shall establish an investment reimbursement fund and appoint a "banker" to manage the contributions of the participants. The banker may be a city employee, a participant in the investment reimbursement area, or a designee of the administrative official. The administrative official shall also establish a fee schedule and method of collecting investment reimbursement administrative fees. 
D.  Establishment of investment reimbursement area. The administrative official shall establish the geographical boundaries of the investment reimbursement area based on the city's plans for infrastructure development and the future utilization of the proposed public infrastructure by adjoining or proximate parcels of land. Every future development or future subdivision located within the investment reimbursement area shall be required to contribute to the cost of the built infrastructure which benefits the property. 
E.  Recovery of reasonable costs. The administrative official shall prepare criteria and rules to determine the allowable costs to be recovered including, but not limited to, the design, supervision, construction and installation costs of that portion of the infrastructure or facility that will be shared by other developers and owners. 
F.  Share formula. The administrative official shall prepare rules to determine the costs apportioned to each project or property within the investment reimbursement area, which rules shall be submitted to the city commission for approval. For properties located within the investment reimbursement area, the administrative official shall establish proposed conditions at the time of subdivision or development requiring future developers to pay contributions into the fund. 
G.  Duration of investment reimbursement area. The investment reimbursement area shall remain in effect for a maximum period of ten years. 
H.  Development agreement requirements. Every development agreement that includes an investment reimbursement plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following components: 
1.  Description of the public facilities included in the investment reimbursement plan; 
2.  An exhibit delineating the applicable investment reimbursement area; and 
3.  Engineering computations and documentation of estimated construction costs which form the basis for determining cost recovery amounts for the investment reimbursement schedule. The estimated construction costs shall be amended in the investment reimbursement schedule upon completion of the project should they differ from the original estimated costs. The party funding and/or constructing the project shall be responsible for furnishing the updated construction cost data to the administrative official, for review and approval, prior to any disbursement according to the investment recouping schedule. 
Article IX - DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS

Schedule D - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT REGULATIONS 

Section 1.0. - Permitted uses. 
    Permitted uses located in planned development projects shall be determined by designating all land areas within the planned development project boundaries for a land use category based on land use categories listed on Schedule B, Permitted Uses of this ordinance. In addition to the requirement that all land areas in planned development projects be designated with a land use category based on Schedule B, permitted uses located within the planned development project boundaries may be further classified based on Schedule A, land use classifications. 
(Ord. No. 3821, § 9, 12-8-2003) 
Section 2.0. - Area and dimensional regulations. 
A.  Minimum parcel area and dimensions required. All planned development projects shall be subject to the following minimum standards: 
1.  Ten thousand square feet of parcel area for all uses excluding mobile homes; 
2.  Forty-three thousand five hundred sixty square feet of parcel area for planned development projects that include mobile homes. 
3.  A parcel depth of 115 feet. 
B.  Minimum required parcel frontage on street: 20 feet. 
C.  Maximum permitted density and intensity standards. New development within the city shall comply with the density and intensity standards set forth in the Future Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
    New development within the following mixed land use designations contained in the Future Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan shall be developed as planned development projects: Airport Industry and Commerce district (AIC); I-4 High Intensity (HI); and the Westside Industry and Commerce district (WIC). 
1.  Airport Industry and Commerce land use designation (AIC). The AIC land use designation is a planned land use mix intended to include intensive industrial development, particularly industries requiring airport linkage. The Airport Industry and Commerce designation is intended to encourage the expansion of industrial land uses in areas where airport noise impacts will prohibit residential development and provide additional areas for mixed use development that would be compatible with airport operations. Hotel and residential uses are intended to accommodate travelers and students, guests and owners of businesses located within the designation. 
Unless approved as a part of a development of regional impact or an airport master plan, all new development within the AIC designated area shall be developed as planned development which shall comply with the regulations of this schedule. Development within the AIC designated area existing prior to the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan will be "grandfathered." 
The maximum intensity of supportive commercial development measured as a floor area ratio is 1.0. The maximum intensity for industrial development shall be 1.0. 
All new development shall include but not be limited to: 
a.  Plans for managing any potential adverse impacts of proposed development on air operations; 
b.  Sound insulation in areas within the airport impact noise zones; 
c.  Controlled access and internal circulation, including provisions for cross access easements, joint use of driveways, and separation of ground transportation from aircraft runways, taxiways, and servicing areas; 
All development on property owned by the Orlando Sanford Airport and included in a development of regional impact or in the Orlando Sanford Airport Master Plan shall be approved through the following process: 
a.  The development of regional impact and/or the airport master plan shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission prior to review and approval by the city commission. 
b.  All individual development projects and/or plans which have been previously included in either the development of regional impact or the airport master plan shall be subject to the engineering plan review procedures of section 5.5 of these regulations prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
2.  I-4 High Intensity (HI). The HI is a mixed use designation intended to promote and regulate anticipated development within the vicinity of the I-4/State Road 46 Interchange. I-4 High Intensity land uses shall include commerce, industry, and high density residential development. 
The maximum intensity of development within the HI district shall be an FAR of 1.0. Maximum residential density shall be 50 dwelling units per acre. 
All new development within the 1-4 High Intensity Area shall comply with performance criteria included in this schedule and as follows: 
a.  Be designed to accommodate and encourage use of multi-modal transportation systems; 
b.  Achieve a high standard of urban design amenities, including pedestrian walkways which link activity centers with parking areas, transit stops, urban plazas, and other open spaces and amenities intended to reinforce appropriate design themes; and 
c.  Incorporate access controls as may be deemed necessary including dedication of cross easements and joint uses of driveway and off-street parking areas. 
3.  Westside Industry and Commerce (WIC). The WIC area is a planned mixed use designation intended to promote development of a major center of commerce and industry in the vicinity of the West SR 46 corridor. The land use mix is intended to include intensive industrial development. Commercial development within the WIC area shall be restricted to operations that provide essential commercial services to industrial development. High density residential development shall be permitted in order to provide housing opportunities near major employment centers. High density residential development shall be permitted in order to provide housing opportunities near major employment centers. 
The maximum intensity of commercial development measured as a floor area ratio is 0.35. The maximum intensity for industrial development as a floor area ratio is 0.50. The maximum residential density shall be 20 dwelling units per acre. 
All new development within the WIC shall be developed as a planned development which shall comply with the regulations of this schedule. In addition, proposals in the WIC area shall be the subject of negotiated development agreements. The review process shall involve county, state, regional, and federal agencies having jurisdiction over impacted resources. No development order shall be granted prior to approval by the city of the development agreement. Development within WIC designated areas existing prior to the adoption of this plan will be "grandfathered." 
All new development in the WIC area shall include standards for controlled access and internal circulation, including cross access easements and joint use of driveways. 
D.  Minimum depth of required building setback. 
1.  Front yard building setback. The minimum required front yard building setback for planned development projects shall comply with base building lines and setback requirements of Schedule I, Base Building Line and Designated Right-of-Way Requirements for Specific Streets, or section 3.0, Land Use Compatibility Requirements of Schedule J, or Schedule C if by use, whichever is greater. 
2.  Minimum depth of required buffer. The minimum depth of a required buffer for planned development projects shall comply with Schedule J, section 3.0, Land Use Compatibility Requirements. 
3.  The required building setback along all boundary lines of the planned development project shall be increased by ten feet for each story in excess of the first two stories. 
Further, the city may require greater than minimum building setbacks based on circumstances the city believes may otherwise adversely affect adjacent land uses. 
4.  Required buffering and setbacks for small parcels. The planning and zoning commission may, upon request by an applicant of a proposed planned development project five acres or less, modify the required setback where such setback would be unreasonable and excessive due to the size of the parcel. 
The applicable buffer and visual screen provisions along all parcel lines in question shall not, however, be waived. 
Section 3.0. - Additional provisions for planned development projects. 
A.  Maximum density for residential uses. The maximum density permitted in residential land areas located in a planned development project shall be consistent with the Future Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Residential land area as referred to herein is the total land area within the planned development project boundaries devoted to dwelling units or mobile homes and is exclusive of any areas devoted to, or proposed for day care facilities for six or more children or public transportation terminals. Land areas within the planned development project boundaries which are devoted to noncommercial amusement facilities may be included in the computations establishing residential land area acreage. 
B.  Open space requirements for multiple-family dwellings. At least 50 percent of the total residential land area at finished grade shall be maintained as open space other than that provided in vehicular circulation and off-street parking area within areas devoted to multiple-family dwellings. 
C.  Project subdivision. Planned development projects may include a proposed subdivision of the land area within the project boundary lines into one or more separately owned and operated units provided the boundary of the area proposed for such subdivision is approved along with the proposed planned development project plan and that the subdivision of all such areas is subject to review and approval in accordance with all applicable provisions and requirements of this ordinance. 
    The total land area contained within the planned development project boundary lines and including the land area proposed for subdivision shall, if approved, be subject to all of the provisions of this ordinance regarding planned development projects in its entirety including all approved land subdivisions regardless of their future ownership. There shall, however, be no subdivision of an approved planned development project unless such subdivision is in conformance with the originally approved planned development project plan or an amended planned development project plan has been approved in conformance with this ordinance. 
D.  Land unsuitable for development. If, in the review of any proposed planned development project, it is found that the land proposed to be developed is unsuitable for such development due to frequent flooding, bad drainage, unstable soil, topographic formations, wetland vegetation or other such conditions that may unduly increase the danger of health, life, or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazards; and, if from adequate investigations conducted by the appropriate public official involved, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public the land should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the proposed planned development project shall not be approved unless acceptable methods are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems that such development and land use will create. 
    If there is any alleged error in any order, requirement, decision or determination related to the failure to approve a proposed planned development project due to the fact the proposed land area is unsuitable for development, the aggrieved applicant or other interested person, including any officer, department or agency of the city, may make an administrative appeal to the city commission as provided in this ordinance. 
[E.  Reserved.] 
F.  Site plan requirements. Planned development applications containing a residential subdivision shall include a site plan of a "typical" lot consisting of the footprint of the residential structure and its mechanical equipment, storage sheds and anticipated accessory structures, all setbacks, open space requirements and swales.

Calculation of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be made in the following manner. 
1.  Determine maximum emission in pounds per hour for each source of emission and divide this figure by the acres in the lot area, thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission, in pounds per acre. 
2.  For each gross hourly rate of emission, deduct the height of emission collection factor from the following table, interpolating as necessary for heights not given. 
TABLE E-1. ALLOWANCES FOR HEIGHT OF EMISSION 
Height of Emission Above Grade 
(feet) Collection 
(pounds per hour per acre) 50 0.01 100 0.06 150 0.10 200 0.16 300 0.30 400 0.50  
The result is the next hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre for each source of emission. 
3.  Adding together individual net rates of emission gives the total new rate of emission from all sources of emission within the boundaries of the lot. 
The total net rate of emission from all sources within the boundaries of a lot or tract in question shall not exceed one pound per acre of lot area during any one hour. 
The emission, from all sources within any lot area, or particulate matter containing more than ten percent by weight of particles having a diameter larger than 44 microns is prohibited.

1.  If alleged violation of the required performance standards for a hazardous or nonhazardous use has been made, the administrative official shall send written notice of such alleged violation to the owner of the property by certified mail. The owner shall be given 30 days to correct the alleged violation unless, in the opinion of the administrative official, there is an imminent peril to the life and property of persons adjacent to the alleged violation in which case the alleged violation shall be corrected immediately. 
2.  Where alleged violations can be determined by the administrative official using equipment normally available to the city or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determination shall be made before notice of violation is issued. 
3.  Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the city to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary to make the determination or violation, the administrative official shall, after approval by the city commission, call in properly qualified experts to make the determination. If expert findings indicate a violation of the required performance standards for a hazardous or nonhazardous use, the cost of the determination shall be assessed against the properties or persons responsible for the violation in addition to the penalties prescribed by the ordinance. If no violation is found, cost of the determination shall be paid for entirely by the city or if the alleged violation originated with an individual other than a city official, cost of the determination shall be paid for entirely by such individual.

I.  Collocation. The City of Sanford desires to minimize the number and general proliferation of communication towers. This section is intended to insure that communication towers that are permitted within the City of Sanford are utilized in a manner that provides for the maximum number of service providers upon each tower within the context of technical feasibility and safety. Further, this section is intended to minimize the number of such towers within the City of Sanford. Specifically, as a minimum, communication towers exceeding 100 feet in height shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate a minimum of two communication service providers, e.g., one additional provider. The city shall have the authority to require, specify and otherwise stipulate that communication towers be engineered and constructed in a manner that provides for two or more collocations as part of the conditional use and/or site plan approval processes. As a condition of approval of all communication towers and to the extent that collocation is technically feasible, all owners of existing communication towers shall, upon request of another service provider and for reasonable and agreed upon consideration, permit additional communication service providers upon such existing communication tower. Applicants desiring to construct new communication towers shall submit written documentation that clearly explains the need for and reasons for the proposed construction of a new communication tower rather than locating proposed antenna array/communication equipment upon an existing tower. Such documentation shall include plans of existing and future towers by the applicant/provider in question, correspondence with existing communication tower owners and may include a cost analysis of alternatives. Existing service providers, e.g., existing communication tower owners, that are unwilling, upon request of another service provider, to allow collocation upon such existing tower, shall submit written documentation to the city with reasons and justification as to why such collocation cannot be accomplished. Competition between service providers shall not be considered to be a valid reason for preventing or otherwise obstructing collocation. The city shall determine whether the applicant and/or the existing provider are reasonable and correct in their respective assertions. If the city determines that either party is being unreasonable or otherwise uncooperative, the city shall deny the applicant's request for a new tower and/or the city may cause the existing communication tower's approval to be revoked and said existing tower to be removed. Such determination involving existing tower owners shall be made in writing and adopted by a majority vote of the city commission upon holding an advertised public hearing and notification of the owner at least 15 days prior to such hearing. Upon adoption of such determination by the city commission, the existing tower owner and the property upon which such tower is located shall be considered to be a violation of the city's land development regulations and shall be subject to any and all remedies and penalties thereof. 
(Ord. No. 3821, § 10, 12-8-2003; Ord. No. 3948, § 13.0, 8-8-2005)

Section 15.0. - Urban infill development projects. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of the urban infill redevelopment program is to encourage the development of vacant infill tracts and lots throughout the city and the redevelopment of properties that may be problematic or otherwise unique. Acknowledging that it may not be economically feasible or attractive to develop or redevelop many of the smaller properties throughout the city under the existing land development regulations, the urban infill program gives the city the flexibility to determine the worthiness of those projects that cannot strictly comply with all the land development regulations that would normally be applied to the project provided that the project can meet the general intent of the comprehensive plan and the land development regulations as applied consistent with the purpose and intent of this section and sound and generally acceptable planning and land use principles and practices. 
    The urban infill redevelopment program ensures that the proposed development is designed and located utilizing innovative techniques and characteristics that are beneficial to the city. Criteria for the urban infill redevelopment (UIR) projects are intended to ensure that a proposed development improves the character of the neighborhood in which it is located and improves the city as a whole; that flexibility in the design is used to construct a project that is superior to a project strictly and rigidly designed consistent with the land development regulations; and that the use is compatible with the surrounding properties. 
    In exchange for a better project, the developer may vary some of the standards and criteria of the land development regulations including, but not limited to, density, building setback, height, lot size and floor area ratio pursuant to a negotiated development order with the city. 
B.  Permitted use. Urban infill redevelopment projects are permitted uses in all zoning districts. 
C.  Conditional use. All urban infill redevelopment projects shall be reviewed as conditional uses. 
D.  Standards for nonresidential and multiple-family UIR projects. Nonresidential urban infill projects shall be consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The proposed land uses in the UIR project are permitted within the City of Sanford. 
2.  The proposed land uses in the UIR project are compatible with adjacent land uses. 
3.  The design creates a form and function that enhances the character of the community. 
4.  The flexibility granted by the city, regarding densities, intensities, building height, lot width, building setbacks, and off-street parking standards, is justified by the benefits to the public good and the ability of the project to assist the City of Sanford in achieving its redevelopment, renewal and revitalization goals as stated in the Comprehensive Plan, the Strategic Plan, the Redevelopment Plan and Finding of Necessity for the Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) and/or the Downtown Sanford/Lake Monroe Waterfront Redevelopment Plan. 
5.  Adequate off-street parking is available either on site or in the immediate vicinity through a shared parking agreement. 
6.  The design of the proposed development complies with the design guidelines for the Downtown Historic District, if applicable. 
7.  The proposed project is located in the established areas of the City of Sanford which are served by existing public facilities. 
8.  The proposed project complies with the requirements of the St. Johns Water Management District. 
E.  Criteria for residential UIR projects. Residential UIR projects shall be consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The proposed land uses in the UIR project are permitted within residential land use categories shown on the City of Sanford Future Land Use Map. 
2.  The proposed land uses in the UIR project are compatible with adjacent land uses. 
3.  The design creates a form and function that enhances the character of the community. 
4.  The flexibility granted by the city, regarding building height, lot width, building setbacks, and off-street parking standards, is justified by the benefits to the community character. 
5.  The development of the residential UIR project will improve the surrounding area. 
6.  The design of the proposed development complies with the design guidelines for the Downtown Historic District, if applicable. 
7.  The proposed project is located in the established areas of the City of Sanford which are served by existing public facilities. 
8.  The proposed project complies with the requirements of the St. Johns Water Management District. 
(Ord. No. 3821, § 10, 12-8-2003; Ord. No. 3948, § 15.0, 8-8-2005) 
Section 16.0. - Multiple-family housing design guidelines. 
A.  Purpose. These design guidelines are intended as a reference to assist the designer in understanding the city's goals and objectives for high quality, multiple-family residential development. Multifamily housing, because of its higher densities, tends to generate large parking areas and decreases private open space. If not properly designed, parking facilities can dominate the site and open spaces may be relegated to leftover areas, not related to the structures or the people who live there. The result of such a condition may be that the development is incompatible with existing and planned developments in the surrounding area. However, if special attention is paid to site and building design features, even large multifamily projects can be made compatible with the city's overall character and appearance. In the design of multifamily developments, emphasis should be placed on giving each unit or each small cluster of units a sense of individual identity rather than an anonymous "project" appearance. 
B.  Applicability. These design regulations shall apply to all multiple-family residential developments except for those developments located in the Waterfront Downtown Business District (WDBD) where a higher density and more urban character is advocated. 
C.  Site plan requirements. 
1.  Project entries. The project entry provides the resident and visitor with an overview of the project. Special attention should be given to hardscape and landscape treatments to enhance the overall project image. 
A project directory shall be provided near the entry to direct residents and visitors to recreational facilities, manager's offices, clubhouses and residential buildings. 
The entry shall be gated. The development shall comply with sections 3.3 and 3.4 of Schedule J, Landscape, Buffer and Tree Requirements of the Sanford land development regulations. In addition, a minimum four-foot masonry wall shall be constructed along all property lines that are not required to have a visual screen pursuant to sections 3.3 and 3.4 of Schedule J, Landscape, Buffer and Tree Requirements of the Sanford land development regulations. 
2.  Entry drives. The principal vehicular access into and through a multifamily housing project shall be by means of an entry drive rather than a parking drive. The entry drive shall be similar to a roadway in a single-family subdivision. The entry drive shall provide access to driveways and parking courts. A colored and/or textured paving treatment at the entry to the development is encouraged. 
3.  Building siting. Residential buildings shall be sited to relate to the entry drives, so that their "best" side is facing the entry drive. All facades that face a curb or roadway shall be a single-family elevation. 
4.  Clustering of units. Clustering of multifamily units shall be a consistent site planning element. Structures composed of a series of simple yet varied planes assure compatibility and variety in overall building form. 
5.  Parking. Parking for residential buildings shall be either in garages, driveways or parking courts that are accessed from the main entry drives. Multiple, small parking courts shall be constructed in lieu of large lots. Parking areas shall be adjacent to, and visible from, the residential buildings that use them to allow for causal surveillance. Parking courts should be separated from each other by dwelling units or by a landscaped buffer not less than 30 feet wide. There should be no more than an average of ten spaces of uninterrupted parking, whether in driveways or open parking areas. 
6.  Open space. There shall be a minimum of 50 percent open space in each multifamily development. Locate public open spaces so that they can be viewed from individual units. 
7.  Mechanical equipment. All mechanical equipment, whether mounted on the roof or ground shall be screened from view. All screening devices shall be compatible with the architecture and color of the dwelling structures. 
8.  Common facilities. Common facilities, such as club houses, laundries and management offices, shall be located centrally in the interior of the development and shall be linked to the residential buildings by lighted pedestrian pathways and common open space areas. 
Street signs and streetlights shall be of a uniform and decorative design. 
All dwelling units shall have individual street addresses. 
All multifamily developments shall provide a covered shelter at the entrance to the development where children can wait for the school bus. The design and material of the shelter shall be consistent with that of the dwelling unit buildings and/or of the surrounding decorative wall. 
Mail delivery areas shall be covered and conveniently located to the residential buildings. 
Trash and recycling areas shall be landscaped on three sides and shall be located at convenient walking distances to each dwelling unit. 
All multifamily developments shall contain recreational facilities for the enjoyment of the residents and their guests at a rate of 200 square feet per dwelling unit. Playgrounds shall be centrally located to allow for adult supervision from dwelling units or from a central facility such as a laundry. 
All multifamily developments with more than 20 residential units shall contain an area designated and designed as a carwash facility. 
D.  Building design. There is no particular architectural style proposed by these regulations for multifamily residential structures. The primary focus should be on constructing a high quality residential environment. The design of multifamily developments shall consider compatibility with the single-family character and scale of the city's residential areas. 
1.  Units per building. There shall be no more than eight dwelling units per building. 
2.  Building articulation. Long, unbroken facades and box-like forms shall be avoided. Building facades shall be broken up to give the appearance of a collection of smaller structures and each of the units shall be individually recognizable. This can be accomplished with the use of balconies and varied setbacks and projections which help articulate individual dwelling units or collections of units, and by the pattern and rhythm of windows and doors. The use of rows of balconies which give the building a "motel" look shall be avoided. 
3.  Dwelling unit access. Breezeways shall be prohibited. Each dwelling unit shall be accessed by a private exterior entry. Entries shall be prominent and visible. This shall be accomplished through the use of distinctive architectural elements. Clusters of entrances shall be avoided. Ground-level entries are preferred for all units. Where exterior stairs are used to access upper-story units, they should be simple and clean and complement the architectural massing and form of the structure. Stairs should be made of smooth stucco, plaster or wood with accent trim of complementary colors. Thin-looking, open metal and prefabricated stairs are prohibited. 
4.  Building height. The overall height of the buildings should be similar to that of other buildings in the neighborhood. Buildings shall be no more than two stories on properties adjacent to single-family dwelling units or single-family zoning districts. On other properties, buildings interior to the development and separated from adjacent properties by 200 linear feet and a two-story building may be three stories. 
Building rooflines may exceed 35 feet in height provided that the height above 35 feet is for decorative purposes only and does not include habitable space. Rooflines should be varied in height and plane and contain dormers, pediments, chimneys, secondary hipped or gabled rooflines or other decorative embellishments to create visual variety and interest. The height of the roof shall be proportionate to the height and mass of the building. 
5.  Balcony/porch requirement. All dwelling units shall have a useful private open space such as a balcony, porch, deck or patio. 
6.  Garages and storage. At least 50 percent of the dwelling units in each building shall have garages accessed directly from the dwelling unit. Garages shall be counted toward the parking requirement. 
    Detached garages and storage units shall be designed in the same style and with the same materials as the dwelling unit buildings. Detached garages or storage units shall be provided in an amount not less than 20 percent of the total number of dwelling units. 
    All garages shall have sectional roll-up doors with automatic openers.

Section 18.0. - Townhouse standards. 
A.  Intent. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations to provide for the design and development of innovative housing forms which incorporate a higher density living situation and at the same time preserve the desirability of an individually owned housing unit. This is accomplished by efficiently utilizing buildable space within a given area by allowing reduced lot size as well as lot width and compensating for the reduction by incorporating open spaces, scenic and recreational areas and other amenities. The following standards have been developed to apply to a variety of such attached and semi-attached housing forms including but not limited to townhouses. 
    Specifically, these regulations are formulated to allow the grouping of separately owned single-family dwelling units into a group of attached housing forms that will be both aesthetically pleasing and conscientiously designed as well as preserve the health, welfare, safety, and convenience of the surrounding neighborhood. 
    Requirements not listed in this section but noted elsewhere in the land development regulations shall apply unless specifically noted otherwise in this section. 
    Condominiums not designed to meet these townhouse standards must conform to the multifamily regulations (LDR Schedule E, section 16). 
B.  Definitions. These definitions shall apply solely to townhouse developments. 
1.  Project site. As used in this Schedule, a townhouse project site is the entire parcel of land for which townhouse units are proposed prior to the creation of any townhouse lots. 
2.  Townhouse. Two or more attached privately owned single-family dwelling units that each share a common wall with the adjacent dwelling unit(s). A townhouse is not an architectural style and may contain any number of stories. All townhouses, however, have the following features: 
Townhouses never have other units above or below; 
Townhouses always have individual exterior entries; 
Townhouses have no more than two walls that are common with adjacent units; and 
Townhouses have a minimum heated living area of 1,400 square feet. 
3.  Townhouse group. A cluster or grouping of townhouse units containing no less than two or more than eight townhouse dwelling units contiguous to each another. 
4.  Townhouse lot. A townhouse lot may be either a properly recorded and deeded lot upon which a townhouse unit is located or a condominium unit. 
C.  Location. Townhouses are permitted in the multiple-family residential MR-1, MR-2 and MR-3 zoning districts, the multiple-family residential office institutional (RMOI) zoning district, general commercial (GC-2), special commercial (SC-3) and the planned development (PD) zoning districts. 
D.  Density. Overall density in a particular townhouse project shall not exceed the maximum density allowed within the zoning district in which it is located. 
E.  Lot area. No townhouse lot shall contain an area of less than 1,800 square feet and a minimum lot and building width of 18 feet. 
F.  Distances between townhouse groups. Townhouse groups, as defined in this chapter, shall be separated by at least 20 feet and, for each story over one, an additional five feet of separation is required. (Greater separation may be required by the city fire department.) 
G.  Townhouse access. Each townhouse unit shall have two separate entries on the ground level. 
H.  Garages and Parking Spaces. The parking requirement for each townhouse shall be two spaces. All parking spaces shall be accommodated on the townhouse lot. Each townhouse shall have at least a one-car garage. All garages shall have sectional roll-up doors with automatic openers. Garages shall be counted toward the parking requirement. It is preferred that garages be accessed from the rear of the townhouse lot by alleys or access tracts. Front-load townhouse garages shall not be placed side by side. Boats, recreational vehicles, travel trailers, trailers and similar vehicles shall not be stored in required parking spaces. The townhouse development shall provide parking areas for boats, recreational vehicles, trailers, etc., at a designated location on site. Overflow parking must be provided at a ratio of one space per four dwelling units at convenient locations throughout the site. 
I.  Maintenance of common areas. All on site improvements, common areas and facilities including, but not limited to, all internal roadways, stormwater management facilities, recreational facilities, off-street parking and common open space must be privately owned and shall be maintained in a satisfactory manner without expense to the city. In order to ensure the maintenance of, and the payment of taxes on the commonly held nonpublic property, an operating homeowners association shall be created by the developer prior to the sale of any townhouse lot or condominium unit and be recorded in the public records of Seminole County if satisfactory to the city commission. Membership in the association shall be mandatory for all residential property owners within the development. 
J.  Conversion. Conversion of existing structures to a townhouse project shall be avoided unless all townhouse development standards as outlined in this section are met without a variance. Compliance with all applicable building and fire codes is also required. 
K.  Building and site design. There is no particular architectural style imposed by these regulations for townhouses. However there is a requirement that the front facades of the buildings utilize a variety of materials and be staggered a minimum of four feet with not more than two adjoining units at the same setback. The primary focus should be on constructing a high quality residential environment and avoiding the sameness that comes with an identical straight-line design. 
1.  Project entries. The project entry provides the resident and visitor with an overview of the project. Special attention should be given to hardscape and landscape treatments to enhance the overall project image. 
The entry shall be gated. The development shall comply with all landscape, buffer and tree requirements of the city's land development regulations. In addition, a minimum four-foot masonry wall shall be constructed along all property lines that are not required to have a visual screen.

4.  Open space. Open space requirements shall be the same as the underlying zoning district, except that open space on individual townhouse lots may exceed such requirements provided that the aggregate open space on the project site shall be same as the underlying zoning district. 
5.  Siting of townhouse groups. An efficient and harmonious grouping of structures and space is consistent with sound and generally accepted planning practices and principles and which encourages the individuality of separate townhouse dwelling units within a unifying design concept. The spacing between structures within the project must meet the requirement of this section and should be compatible with spacing between structures in the surrounding neighborhood. 
6.  Design of townhouse structures. The design of the townhouse structures and overall site plan shall be compatible with the physical characteristics of the site, with the buildings adjacent to the site, and with the character of the neighborhood. Design compatibility of buildings includes harmonious building style, form, size, color, materials and relationship to site topography. A compatible design is one that preserves or improves the existing neighborhood character, facilitates efficient and convenient internal circulation, is functionally related to the natural topography, utilizes natural characteristics of the site and is an asset to the community. 
a.  No more than two abutting townhouses may have a common front building setback. 
b.  Variations in the setback of front facades shall be at least four feet. 
c.  The roof covering must be tile or architectural shingles or an approved upgrade alternative. Alternative coverings are subject to approval by the planning commission. 
d.  Roof style and height variations are encouraged, and shall be incorporated where feasible in the townhouse design. 
L.  Trash and recycling. Trash and recycled items shall be picked up at each unit in the same manner as a single-family dwelling. Dumpsters, compactors and recycling areas may be used if designed to fit into the community. Enclosures must be designed to disguise the equipment and fit with the overall design. Locations must be convenient to all homes and easily accessible. 
M.  Mechanical equipment. All mechanical equipment, whether mounted on the roof or ground shall be screened from view. All screening devices shall be compatible with the architecture and color of the dwelling structures.

    Active. Refers to an area, entrance or feature that is frequently used and has a high level of activity or movement. 
    Cut off fixture. An outdoor light fixture shielded or constructed in such a manner that no more than two and one-half percent of the total light emitted by the fixture is projected above the horizontal plane of the fixture. 
    Footcandle. A unit of measure for luminance. A unit of luminance on a surface that is everywhere one foot from a uniform point source of light of one candle and equal to one lumen per square foot. 
    Fully cutoff fixture. An outdoor light fixture shielded or constructed in such a manner that it emits no light above the horizontal plane of the fixture. 
    Fully shielded lighting. Lighting constructed in such a manner that all light emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamp or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection or refraction from any part of the luminaire, is projected below the horizontal. Such fixtures usually have a flat, horizontally oriented lens and opaque (usually metal) sides. 
They are often described as "shoebox" luminaires if the luminaire has a predominantly rectangular form. Fixtures that either has reflecting surfaces or lenses (clear or prismatic) located below the lamp and visible from the side or above and fixtures that can be mounted such that the shielding is ineffective are not considered fully shielded lighting. 
    Glare. The effect produced by a light source within the visual field that is sufficiently brighter than the level to which the eyes are adapted, to cause annoyance, discomfort or loss of visual performance and ability. 
    Horizontal luminance. The measurement of brightness from a light source, usually measured in footcandles or lumens, which is taken through a light meter sensor at a horizontal position. 
    Inactive. Refers to an area, entrance or feature that is infrequently used and normally locked. 
    Light trespass. Light from an artificial light source that is intruding into an area where it is not wanted or does not belong. 
    Lumen. A quantitative unit measuring the amount of light emitted by a light source. 
    Uniformity ratio (U. Ratio). Describes the average level of illumination in relation to the lowest level of illumination for a given area. Example: U. Ratio is 4:1; the lowest level of illumination should be no less than 25 percent or four times less than the average level of illumination. 
    Wall pack. A type of light fixture typically flush-mounted on a vertical wall surface. 
D.  Exemptions. The following types of lighting are exempted from these regulations: 
1.  Reasonable holiday lighting during the period from October 15 to February 15, if the lighting does not create a hazard or nuisance from glare or luminance. 
2.  Traffic control signals and devices installed by or at the direction of a public agency. 
3.  Temporary emergency lighting in use by law enforcement or government agencies or at their direction.

6.  All wall pack fixtures shall be cutoff fixtures except those adjacent to an arterial or collector road, in or adjacent to a residential zoning district or adjacent to a dwelling unit which shall be of the shoe box type. The lighting use or location of the wall pack shall determine the maximum footcandle allowed. Except as noted above, wall packs may be of the non-cutoff type, if located in a commercial or industrial area that cannot be seen from a roadway or residential parcel or district. 
7.  Adjacent to residential property, no direct light source shall be visible at the property line at ground level or above. 
8.  The maximum height of any outdoor light, as measured from the ground to the top of the lighting fixture or light pole, whichever is higher, shall be 25 feet.

Section 4.2. - Designated right-of-way lines. 
    Designated right-of-way lines are hereby established for the streets specifically listed. The purpose of the designated right-of-way lines shall be to reserve sufficient space for the future circulation of vehicular traffic and to reduce the undesirable and adverse impact of noise, congestion and related safety hazards associated with the intensified use of land resulting from new growth and development. All designated street right-of-way lines shall be located and measured from the centerline of the existing or proposed street right-of-way. 
Section 4.3. - Base building line and designated right-of-way line requirements for specific streets. 
    Base building lines and designated right-of-way lines shall be as indicated for the streets specifically listed in Schedule I, Base Building Line and Designated Right-of-Way Line Requirements for Specific Streets.

At least 75 percent of the parcel area located within the minimum lakeside building setback shall be maintained as open space other than that provided in vehicular circulation and off-street parking area. 
B.  The relationship between the maximum building height and the maximum building area for all parcel area within 100 feet of the lakeside parcel line shall be as follows: 
Maximum Building Height 

(in feet) Maximum 
Building Area 
(% of parcel area) Up to 35 25 36-50 20 51-65 15 66-80 10 81-95 5 96 or more 0  
Section 5.0. - Modification to off-street parking and/or loading, unloading and service area. 
Section 5.1. - Off-street parking modifications. 
    The planning and zoning commission, upon request by an applicant, may grant a conditional use (ref. Administration: section 3.9) in order to modify the requirement for off-street parking and/or loading, unloading and service area space and/or base building line compliance providing the following determinations are made: 
A.  Construction of the required off-street parking and/or loading, unloading and service area space and/or complying with the base building line requirements on the premises would: 
1.  Prevent the continuous development of a compact and coordinated row of already existing and adjacent buildings fronting on an already established street, block or developed area. 
2.  Detract from the overall desirability of the adjoining buildings and premises and would result in the incompatible mixing of vehicles, buildings and pedestrians. 
B.  The required off-street parking space cannot be reasonably provided off the premises in accordance with these land development regulations, within the principal building being proposed or within a parking structure located on the premises. 
C.  The required loading, unloading and service area space is excessive in regard to the specific use proposed and is not necessary in order to properly serve the premises and the occupants thereof. 
D.  1.  There is an existing building located on a parcel immediately adjacent to the parcel in question and such building does not comply with the base building line requirements of these regulations. In addition, the existing building shall be located within 200 feet of the parcel in question and shall front on the same side of the street as the parcel in question. 
2.  The required base building line is unreasonable and excessive. 
3.  No base building line requirement shall, however, be reduced to the extent that any building shall be permitted to encroach upon the designated street right-of-way line or to be located any closer to the street than the existing building located on the adjacent parcel. 
Section 5.2 - Administrative official. 
    The administrative official shall, at the request of an applicant, reduce the base building line requirements of this schedule subject to the following conditions: 
A.  There is an existing building located on each parcel immediately adjacent on both sides of the parcel in question and neither of which comply with the base building line requirements of this schedule. In addition, each of the existing buildings shall be located within 100 feet of the parcel in question and shall front on the same side of the street as the parcel in question. 
B.  No base building line requirement shall, however, be reduced to the extent that any building shall be permitted to encroach upon the designated street right-of-way line or to be located any closer to the street than the existing principal buildings located on the adjacent parcels.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-4363, § 2, adopted Feb. 8, 2016, Schedule J in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Schedule J pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Section 1.0. - Purpose and intent. 
    Landscape, buffer and tree protection requirements serve many purposes in the built-up environment. Landscape provides visual and climatic relief from buildings, structures and broad expanses of pavement; landscape buffers pedestrian and vehicular traffic; trees provide shade, scenic beauty and natural habitat. 
    In general, landscaping and buffers shall be designed to: 
(1)  Enhance the urban development by blending natural and manmade environments. 
(2)  Provide shade for paved surfaces. 
(3)  Separate vehicular and nonvehicular use areas. 
(4)  Define vehicular accessways and access points. 
(5)  Screen vehicular movement, noise and glare. 
(6)  Provide visual and physical separation of potentially incompatible land uses. 
(7)  Incorporate water conservation features such as drought tolerant landscaping and reclaimed water usage as required herein. 
(8)  Protect the enjoyment of city parks and the aesthetics of city properties and rights-of-way. 
(9)  Regulate, to the extent permitted by law, the activities of utility providers when conducting vegetation maintenance and tree pruning or trimming within the established right-of-way. 
    Landscape, landscaped areas, buffers and tree protection shall be provided and maintained and/or accomplished for all premises, of whatsoever type or nature, in the manner set forth in this schedule. Required landscaped areas shall be located at or above grade unless otherwise prescribed in these land development regulations. The minimum provision of required landscape, landscaped areas, buffers and trees may be exceeded. Unless otherwise prescribed, the most stringent provision of this schedule shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2016-4363, § 2, 2-8-2016)

    Berm. Manmade earth contoured so as to form a mound above the general elevation of the adjacent ground or surface and designed to provide visual interest, screen undesirable view and/or decrease noise. 
    Buffer. A combination of physical space and vertical elements such as plants, berms, fences, or walls, whose purpose is to separate and screen incompatible land uses from one another. 
    Caliper. For the purposes of this schedule, caliper shall mean the diameter of a tree measured at breast height (dbh) which is four and one-half feet above the ground. 
    Canopy tree. Tall trees that form the uppermost leaf layer in a natural landscape as may be required by these regulations. 
    Clear trunk. The distance between the top of the root ball and the point of the trunk where lateral branching begins.

G.  Intersection visibility . When an accessway intersects a public right-of-way, landscape shall be used to define the intersection; provided, however, that all landscape within the triangular areas described below shall provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between two and one-half and ten feet. Trees shall be trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into defined triangular areas. Landscape, except grass and groundcover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the edge of any accessway pavement. 
    The triangular areas are defined as follows: 
1.  The areas of property on both sides of an accessway formed by the intersection of each side of the accessway and the public right-of-way pavement line with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other two sides. 
2.  The area of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two or more public streets with two sides of the triangular area being measured 25 feet in length along the abutting edge of pavement, from their point of intersection, and the third being a line connecting the ends of the other two lines.

A.  Protective barriers . During construction, protective barriers shall be placed, as necessary, and/or as directed by the administrative official to prevent the destruction or damaging of trees. Trees destroyed or receiving major damage must be replaced before occupancy or use unless approval for their removal has been granted under the provisions of this article. All trees not designated for removal may be required to be protected by barrier zones erected prior to construction of any structures, roads, utility service, or other improvements, and may be required to comply with the following if determined to be necessary by the administrative official. 
1.  The protective barrier shall be constructed to the following standards: 
a.  The protective barrier shall be constructed outside the drip line of the tree (See Figure A). 
b.  The protective barrier shall be a minimum of three feet high.

Whenever any electric, water, telephone or other public utility firm or corporation wishes to extend, maintain or relocate service such that any tree on an unimproved lot or tract will be removed, they shall make application for a permit to do so. Any public utility wishing to prune trees on a right-of-way shall notify the administrative official in writing in advance of the time and place those pruning activities will take place. The administrative official shall supervise these activities as necessary and shall have the authority to regulate or halt such pruning when these actions are deemed detrimental to the trees or beyond that needed to insure continued utility service. 
(Ord. No. 2016-4363, § 2, 2-8-2016) 
Section 6.0. - Drought tolerant plant standards applicable to required landscaping. 
    Drought tolerant plants which shall be used in required landscaping are native, non-invasive plants which will survive and flourish with comparatively little supplemental irrigation. 
    Industrial, commercial, civic, and multi-family residential buildings or structures; common areas of single family or multi-family residential developments shall incorporate drought tolerant trees, shrubs, and groundcovers in landscape plans as a water conservation measure. A list of plants which require minimal water are included in the Florida water management districts' publication: Waterwise, Florida Landscapes. In addition, mulches and drought tolerant groundcovers shall replace narrow turf areas where irrigation is impractical. Interior remodels or minor modifications to the exterior of a structure are not subject to this requirement.

B.  Maintenance also includes, but is not limited to, the replacement of plants damaged by insects, disease, vehicular traffic, acts of God and vandalism. Necessary replacements shall be made within a time period not to exceed 30 days after notification by the city of a violation of this schedule. 
C.  In order to increase the tree canopy within the city, give shade to paved surfaces, buffer pedestrian and vehicular traffic and provide scenic beauty and natural habitat, as well as prevent decay, sunburn and hazards to trees, all landscape material required under this schedule shall be pruned to maintain the natural shape of the plant. No topping, hatracking, poodle cutting, excess pruning or excess crown reduction shall be performed and such actions are unlawful.

E.  Wetland buffer. A wetland buffer of 25 feet in width shall be provided adjacent to wetlands that are five acres or less; a wetland buffer of 50 feet in width shall be provided adjacent to wetlands that are greater than five acres. The area of wetlands in question shall include all contiguous wetlands located on the site and adjacent to the site. The width of the wetland buffer shall be measured and provided parallel to the edge of the wetland in question. The required wetland buffer shall, unless otherwise provided for in this schedule, be planted and maintained in landscaping materials including groundcover, shrubs, hedges or trees. 
The following uses are permissible within a wetland buffer: 
1.  Required project improvements; 
2.  Permitted public service structures; 
3.  Walkways with previous surfaces; and 
4.  Required landscaped areas. 
The following uses are prohibited within a wetland buffer:

2.  Buildings. 
In addition, all off-street parking spaces located adjacent to a wetland buffer shall be provided with appropriate tire stops, curbs or other vehicular bumper guards designed to prevent any encroachment of vehicles upon the required buffer. 
F.  Wetland transition area. The purpose of the wetlands transition area is to ensure the continuing function of respective wetland communities. The wetlands transition area is defined as the area separating wetland and upland areas in which development activities shall be regulated to protect wetlands. The wetlands transition zone is an area having direct groundwater or surface water influence and provides a buffer between wetlands and development or other land alteration activities. 
The following activities are prohibited in the wetland transition area: 
1.  Any development that the administrative official finds will have an adverse impact on the function of wetlands communities, groundwater or surface water located therein; 
2.  All industrial uses; 
3.  Sanitary landfills;

I.  Regulatory authority. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the St. Johns Water Management District shall have regulatory authority over wetland areas and the use of compensatory storage and mitigation consistent with the provisions state law. 
J.  Public necessity. In the event of a public necessity or to prevent a taking of all beneficial and economically viable uses of property, the city may enter into a development agreement. The city commission may approve a development order providing for otherwise prohibited uses within wetlands if all regulatory permits have been issued for said use. 
Section 3.2. - Floodprone area design and performance criteria. 
    Uses and activities in floodprone areas shall comply with the following design and performance criteria: 
A.  Retention-detention facilities. Retention-detention ponds proposed to be located in floodprone areas shall: 
1.  Ten-year floodplain. Be located above the ten-year flood elevation. No alteration shall be allowed within the ten-year flood line. 
2.  Soil suitability. Be located in soils that are suitable for retention-detention ponds. Soils which have been identified by the Soil Conservation Service as having a very low potential for septic tank absorption fields shall be considered as unsuitable for retention-detention ponds. 
3.  Floodway hazard. Not create a negative impact on existing flooding conditions. Construction of the retention-detention pond shall not constitute a net reduction in floodplain storage or limit the flow capacity of the floodway. 
B.  Open space and recreational uses. Floodprone areas may be used for open space and recreational uses. Recreation-oriented structural improvements shall not impair the flood flow or flood storage capacity nor shall such structures contribute to the debris which may become swept up by floodwaters. Open space and recreational uses include the following: 
1.  Hiking and nature trails. 
2.  Gazebos, picnic tables and resting benches. 
3.  Boardwalks and observation decks. 
4.  Open play areas. 
5.  Canoe launches. 
C.  Traversing works. Traversing works in floodprone areas shall not create a net reduction in either flood flow or flood storage capabilities immediately upstream or downstream of the structure. 
D.  Compensating storage. Reshaping and filling within floodprone areas shall be balanced by providing an equal volume of compensating storage. Such compensation shall be located between the ordinary high water elevation and the 100-year elevation. Fill shall not be placed below the ten-year flood elevation and in no case shall fill in the floodplain extend beyond 100 feet of the original floodline. Reshaping the floodplain shall not create a rise in flood elevation, reduce flood storage capabilities, increase flood flow velocities, or reduce flood flow capacity. 
E.  Parking spaces and vehicular circulation areas. Required parking spaces and vehicular circulation areas located within floodprone areas shall not cause a net decrease in flood storage or a change in flood flow capacity. Flood free emergency access must be maintained. Required parking spaces shall not be located within the ten-year flood elevation. 
F.  Utilities. Utilities shall be located outside of floodprone areas wherever feasible. When it is not feasible to avoid placing utilities within a floodplain, such utilities shall comply with the following provisions. 
1.  Materials. Material and equipment shall be resistant to flood damage. 
2.  Construction methods. Construction methods and practices shall minimize flood damage. 
3.  Potable water supply. Potable water supply systems shall be designed and constructed to prevent damage by floodwaters. 
4.  Sanitary sewage system. Septic tanks and other sanitary sewage systems are prohibited. 
G.  Special requirements for the 100-year floodplain. The following floodplain protection measures are established to protect and preserve the value and function of the 100-year floodplain from encroachment by development. 
1.  Prohibited development. No development shall occur in the 100-year floodway. 
2.  Compensating storage. Flood control measures for new development shall minimize fill within the 100-year floodplain. Where no alternative to fill within the 100-year floodplain exists, compensatory storage for such fill shall be provided through excavation of a volume of uplands equivalent to the loss of storage within the 100-year floodplain caused by the placement of fill. 
3.  Clustering of structures. Structures shall be clustered on the non-floodplain portions of the site, or where the entire site lies in the floodplain, they shall also be elevated on pilings. Densities and/or intensities of land uses shall be reduced in floodplains based on design and conservation measures required to protect the biological and physical functions of the floodplain. The density/intensity shall be regulated on a case by case basis after field investigation and analysis of specific issues confronting respective sites. 
4.  Sanitary sewer facilities. Septic tanks and other on-site sewer facilities are prohibited in the 100-year floodplain. 
5.  Hazardous materials and waste. No hazardous materials or waste shall be stored within the 100-year floodplain. 
6.  Dredge and fill. In order to protect the physical and biological functions of floodplains, dredge and fill practices and the clearing of natural vegetation shall be minimized in order to maintain the natural topography and hydrological functions of floodplains. 
7.  "Grandfathering" development. For sites (legal parcels of record on or before the date of the Comprehensive Plan adoption) which do not contain sufficient uplands to permit development, fill and clearing of natural vegetation shall be allowed only in conjunction with a minimal accessway and a minimum amount of fill beneath one residential structure, provided the direction and rate of historical surface water flows are no [not] altered. Subsequent to plan adoption, lots or parcels may not be created without sufficient uplands. 
8.  FEMA/LOMR. Whenever fill is placed within a special flood hazard area (SFHA) as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and shown on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) in order to raise a building site out of the SFHA, a "letter of map revision based on fill" shall be submitted to FEMA for review and approval. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner who is placing the fill on the property to submit the information required by FEMA for the letter of map revision based on fill. A letter of map amendment shall be submitted by the owner of property and approved by FEMA to remove a structure or property from the SFHA. 
H.  Other. All proposed uses and activities to be located in floodprone areas that are not otherwise indicated in these land development regulations or in article V, Flood Protection Land Development Regulations [chapter 46, article II], Sanford City Code, shall be subject to review and recommendation by the administrative official on an individual basis. 
I.  Exemption adjacent to Lake Monroe. Because the Lake Monroe shoreline and adjacent lands are in a highly altered state from the natural conditions, the administrative official shall have the authority to exempt floodprone areas adjacent to Lake Monroe from provisions contained in subsections 3.2.A through E, above. 
Section 3.3. - Wildlife habitat preservation and protection of upland vegetative communities and endangered or threatened flora and fauna. 
    Upland vegetative communities and wildlife habitats (particularly those identified as primary habitat for endangered or threatened species) for which the city or state agency deems environmentally significant shall be protected from adverse impacts associated with development. Upland areas identified in Table I-9 of the future land use element of the Comprehensive Plan as essential breeding, feeding or habitat sites for endangered or threatened flora or fauna creatures shall be protected pursuant to the following land development regulations: 
A.  Regulation of sites with endangered or threatened species. Applicants for development within any areas identified as refuge, breeding, feeding, or habitat areas of endangered or threatened species shall prepare a habitat management plan which shall, as a minimum, include the following: 
1.  Critical habitat management plan required. An applicant of a site plan, subdivision, plan, replat, or PD master plan, where the proposed development is located in Upland areas as identified in Map I-9 of the City of Sanford Comprehensive Plan shall provide, at the applicant's cost, a "Critical Habitat Management Plan" prepared by a professional biologist, ecologist, or other related professional. The plan shall ensure the protection of endangered and threatened flora and fauna as determined by the state and the city. As a minimum standard this plan shall analyze the following issues:

B.  Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following definitions are provided: 
1.  Soil erosion shall mean any removal and/or loss of soil by the action of water, gravity, or wind. Erosion includes both the detachment and transport of soil particles. 
2.  Sedimentation shall mean the settling out of the soil particles which are transported by water or wind. Sedimentation occurs when the velocity of water or wind in which soil particles are suspended is slowed to a sufficient degree and for a sufficient period of time to allow the particles to settle out of suspension or when the degree of slope is lessened to achieve the same result. 
3.  Erodible slope shall mean all slopes with inclines in excess of four percent unless modified by the administrative official based on consideration of specific soil conditions. 
4.  Large flat surface area (unpaved) shall mean an area which is flat or whose slope is less than four percent and which consists of more than 1,000 square feet of exposed soil. 
C.  Erosion control measures. All measures necessary to minimize soil erosion and to control sedimentation in the disturbed land area shall be implemented. The following protection shall be provided for all disturbed areas: minimize velocities of water runoff, maximize protection of disturbed areas from stormwater runoff, and retain sedimentation within the development site as early as possible following disturbances. A list of major problem areas for erosion and sedimentation control follows. For each one, the purpose(s) of requiring control is described. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures for all such areas shall be provided with a view toward achieving the specific purpose listed below for which a control plan is required. 
1.  Erodible slopes. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles from slope. 
2.  Streams, stream beds, stream banks, bodies of water, lake shorelines. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles. 
3.  Drainageways. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles (which would otherwise deposit in streams, bodies of water, or wetlands); promote deposit or sediment loads (traversing these areas) before these reach bodies of water. 
4.  Land adjacent to streams, ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Prevent detachment and transportation of soil particles. The applicant shall not adversely impact aquatic vegetation within the sensitive transition zone separating wetlands and uplands. No such vegetation shall be disturbed without approval of the administrative official. Any such approval shall be based on a demonstrated necessity which promotes the overall public health, safety and welfare. Furthermore, any such disturbance of aquatic vegetation shall be compensated by revegetation based on a plan approved by the city as provided herein. The applicant shall coordinate plans for development along lake Monroe with appropriate state and/or federal agencies. Where deemed appropriate by the city, the site plan shall include the planting of native indigenous aquatic plant vegetation to promote stability of the shoreline. 
5.  Enclosed drainage structure. Prevent sedimentation in structure, erosion at outfall of system, and deposit of sediment loads within system or beyond it. 
6.  Large flat surface areas (unpaved). Prevent detachment of soil particles and their off-site transportation. 
7.  Impervious surfaces. Prevent the detachment and transportation of soil (in response to an increase in the rate and/or volume of runoff of the site or its concentration caused by impervious surfaces). 
8.  Borrow and stockpile areas. Divert runoff from face of slopes which are exposed in the excavation process; convey runoff in stabilized channels to stable disposal points; leave borrow areas and stockpiles in stable condition and plant native groundcover to assist such stabilization. 
9.  Adjacent properties. Prevent their erosion and/or being deposited with sediment. 
D.  Applicability. Appropriate measures shall be taken during land clearing and building operations to assure that exposed, destabilized or otherwise altered soil is expeditiously covered with an acceptable erosion control material. This provision shall be applicable to the act of subdividing and installation of related improvements as well as during the development review process including the period during which improvements may occur as well as the length of time soil may be exposed to the environment. 
    Schedule J, Landscape, Buffer and Tree Requirements, shall be applicable to all clearing and grading activities and shall include specifications for management principles guiding the removal or placement of vegetation and landscaping design. All development activities must be implemented in conjunction with precautionary measures, where necessary, to avert destruction or damage to native vegetation.

The following regulations apply to any zoning district/classification where a parcel of land is contiguous to a non-navigable lake, such parcel of land may be used as non-navigable lake access property or as common open space non-navigable lake access property held in common by the property owners of a subdivision, an owners association of whatever type or nature, or any similar entity; or held in common by virtue of the terms of a plat of record; or provided for common use under deed covenants or restrictions of record; or easement, park, common-fee ownership, single-fee ownership, condominium arrangement, license, or lease; or owned by two or more dwelling units located away from the waterfront, but only if the following conditions are met: 
a.  A parcel must be a minimum of 7,000 square feet in size and have a minimum of 50 linear feet of lake frontage in such common lake front area, as measured along the normal high water mark line of the lake and a minimum parcel depth of 140 feet or 165 feet if no public sanitary sewer is available. 
b.  A non-navigable lake access parcel shall not be permitted if it consists of a wetland, swamp, marsh or bog as shown on the most recent U.S. geological survey maps or any other federal or state data source that is found by the city to be reasonably relied upon for the purpose of making such a determination nor shall the parcel be altered by dredging, the addition of earth or fill material or by the drainage of water frontage to be made non-navigable lake access property; provided, however, that, this section shall not be construed or interpreted to conflict with any federal or state permitting or regulatory program. 
c.  No more than four lawfully registered vessels may be stored in any manner on land or in the water on non-navigable lake access property. 
d.  The access and use regulations contained in this section shall be fully applicable to all planned development (PD), open space development community and plats or developments unless such additional access use is approved as a conditional use (if authorized in the zoning district involved). 
e.  In addition to the above limitations, no easement, private park, common area, lot or access property abutting or adjoining a non-navigable lake shall be used to permit access to the lake for more than two single-family homes, dwelling units, condominiums, apartments or any other use unless such additional access use is approved as conditional use. 
C.  Implementing administrative actions; user's manual; adoption of administrative rules. The city manager, or designee, shall have the power and authority, and is encouraged, to adopt a user's manual to assist in the implementation of this section. 
D.  Enforcement and penalties.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 4337, § 2, adopted March 23, 2015, amended Schedule N in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Schedule N pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 
Cross reference- Planning and development, ch. 74; streets, sidewalks and other public places, ch. 94. 

Section 1.0. - Streets, lots and tracts design. 
Section 1.1. - Applicability. 
    All subdivisions, streets, lots, tracts and related improvements shall be developed and improved in accordance with the minimum standards and requirements set forth in this schedule. 
    Nonconforming properties or access features shall be brought into compliance with this schedule to the greatest extent practical when the following conditions or circumstances occur: 
 A new driveway permit is requested; 
 An increase in land use intensity or density is requested; 
 A significant change in trip generation is requested; or 
 As changes in road design allow. 
    Whenever a determination under this schedule requires, under Florida law, a determination by a licensed professional engineer, such determination shall be made by the city engineer or an engineering consultant of the city. 
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 1.2. - General street design and arrangement. 
A.  Comprehensive Plan consistency. Proposed streets shall be consistent with the Traffic Circulation Plan Element of the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, proposed streets shall conform to requirements set forth in Schedule I, Base Building Line and Designated Right-of-Way Requirements for Specific Streets. 
B.  Natural contours. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient. 
C.  Connectivity. 
1.  The street system of a proposed subdivision shall be designed to coordinate with existing, proposed, and planned streets outside of the subdivision while discouraging the use of local streets by cut-through traffic. This may be accomplished by the use of modified grid systems, T-intersections, roadway jogs or other appropriate traffic calming measures within the development. 
2.  Wherever a proposed development abuts unplatted land or a future development phase of the same development, street stubs shall be provided as deemed necessary by the city to provide access to abutting properties or to logically extend the street system into the surrounding area consistent with sound engineering and planning practices and principles. All street stubs shall be provided with temporary turn-around or cul-de-sacs unless specifically exempted by the public works director based upon a finding and determination that the public interest does not require such construction. Subsequently, the restoration and extension of the street shall be the responsibility of any future developer of the abutting land. 
3.  Subcollector and local residential access streets shall connect with surrounding streets to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods or facilitate emergency access and evacuation. 
4.  Whenever local and minor residential street connections between abutting subdivisions are required by the city, the connecting facility shall be designed to discourage through traffic by nonresidents. This may be accomplished by the following when approved by the city engineer: 
a.  Curving the street, whenever practicable, to the extent necessary to avoid roadway segments where higher operating speeds can be attained; 
b.  The planned design and posted speed for these vehicular linkages between residential subdivisions to be equal or less than 25 miles per hour; 
c.  Encouraging the use of traffic circles, landscape islands, medians and other forms of traffic barriers within the right-of-way as a means of discouraging through traffic by nonresidents. 
D.  Street jogs. Street jogs, or centerline offsets in the horizontal alignment of streets across intersections of less than 200 feet shall be prohibited. 
E.  Street intersections. The design and location of intersections shall be consistent with the specifications of the "Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways", referred to as the "Green Book". 
Intersections shall be designed to intersect at right angles where possible and in no case shall intersect at an angle less than 60 degrees as per the requirements of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and Green Book Standards. 
The connection of more than two streets shall be avoided. 
1.  Spacing for Unsignalized Street Intersections: 
a.  The minimum spacing requirements of this section may be reduced upon finding by the city that, given the particular conditions of the proposed development, the minimums cannot be met and such reduction will not compromise operational and safety standards. 
b.  An arterial road may intersect an arterial road only if aligned with and extending an existing arterial or at a desirable distance of one mile from the intersection of existing arterials. 
c.  A collector may intersect an arterial but only if aligned with and extending an existing collector which intersects the arterial or at a desirable distance of 1,320 feet from the intersection of an existing collector and the arterial. 
d.  Intersections between local streets and arterials shall be avoided. In cases where they do intersect, the local street shall be aligned with and extending an existing local street which intersects the arterial or at a desirable distance of 660 feet from any other street intersection. 
e.  A collector may intersect another collector only if aligned with and extending an existing collector or at a desirable distance of 660 feet from the intersection of any other intersection. 
f.  A local street may intersect a collector if spaced at a minimum distance of 660 feet from any other intersection or, in the case of a "T" type intersection, at a desirable distance of 660 feet from any other street intersection. 
g.  A residential street functions only to service a local residential community and does not connect any higher classified roadways. 
2.  Spacing for signalized intersections. It is desirable that intersections that are to be signalized have spacing specifications that are different from that of non-signalized intersections in order that distances between signals be capable of providing reasonable cycle lengths. The need for signals will be based upon one or more of the warrants included in the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices" being satisfied. The following are minimum spacing of signalized intersections for both urban and rural roadways: 
Road Classification Signal Spacing Principal Arterial 1,600-2,000 feet Minor Arterial 1,200-1,600 feet Collector 660 feet  
F.  Half streets. Half streets are prohibited. 
G.  Street names. All streets within a subdivision hereafter established shall be named. No name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with existing street names. All names shall be approved by the administrative official. 
H.  Additional right-of-way. A proposed use or subdivision that abuts an existing street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements set forth in this schedule shall provide for the dedication of additional right-of-way along either one or both sides of said street so that the minimum right-of-way required by these regulations can be established. Additional right-of-way shall be dedicated to the applicable public entity. 
I.  Street identification signs. Street identification signs which comply with the following specifications shall be installed by the developer at all street intersections (See Figure N-10).

Category Minimum 
Radius 2-Lane Access 35' Local to Collector 35' Local or Collector to Arterial 50'  
N.  Other street improvements. The developer shall be responsible for installing all transportation related improvements required by the city including, but not limited to, auxiliary lanes, traffic control signs, stop signs, stop bars, speed limit signs, street name signs and cross walks. All traffic control devices, including pavement markings, shall conform to the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Painted wooden regulatory signs are prohibited. High intensity 30 inch stop signs shall be used. 
When a modification to the width of an existing roadway is necessary, a minimum one inch of asphaltic concrete overlay with leveling will be installed the full length of the entire affected section of the adjacent roadway which will maintain drainage flow paths. The overlay shall extend a minimum of 12 inches beyond the existing width of the pavement. 
When more than 15 mail boxes are grouped or clustered together, a temporary off-street parking space shall be provided adjacent to the mail boxes. A sign shall be provided designating the parking space as temporary and for the use of persons accessing the mail boxes. 
O.  Clear zone. The clear zone is the total roadside border area starting at the edge of the motor vehicle travel lane, available for safe use by errant vehicles. It is usually the space between the travel lane and the sidewalk. Clear zones are based on the design speed of the road and shall be as follows: 
Road Classification Design Speed Urban Clear Zone Rural Clear Zone Local 25 mph and below 4 feet 6 feet Local 26-35 mph 4 feet 6 feet Collector 30-40 4 feet 10 feet  
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015; Ord. No. 4432, § 4, 1-22-2018) 
Section 1.3. - Local streets. 
A.  Local street types. When a street's right-of-way is not established in Schedule C of these land development regulations, such street shall be classified as a local street. Major local streets that serve to collect and distribute traffic from shorter local streets within a parcel of 20 or more acres in size shall be designated and identified as local collector streets. 
B.  Minimum right-of-way and pavement. Pavement width shall be exclusive of curb and gutter. Each travel lane shall have a minimum pavement width of 12 feet. The minimum right-of-way width and pavement width for urban local streets shall be as follows:

C.  Urban and rural streets. Streets in the city shall utilize urban-type design features which reflect a "closed" drainage system including gutters, inlets and miami or raised curbs. New rural-type street design features which reflect an "open" drainage system including open swales are prohibited. Typical details of urban street sections are reflected in Figure N-1. 
D.  Permanent dead-end streets. Dead-end streets designed as such permanently, shall be provided with a cul-de-sac at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of not less than 100 feet, and a right-of-way diameter of not less than 110 feet. Such dead-end streets shall not exceed 800 feet from cul-de-sac radius to centerline intersection of the closest intersecting street. 
1.  Cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sacs shall be provided with a turnaround having a pavement radius of 50 feet excluding the curbing. If an island is to be constructed in the cul-de-sac, the minimum turnaround radius shall be 50 feet and shall be measured from the outside radius of the island. The island shall have FDOT mountable curbs and a minimum diameter of 20 feet. The island shall be improved with landscaping that will not interfere with the clear sight distance. 
2.  Temporary dead-end streets for future access. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround area which shall meet the requirements of the administrative official for design, maintenance, and removal. 
E.  Intersection improvements. Street improvement at intersections shall include the use of a concrete valley gutter in conformity with specifications illustrated on Figure N-3. 
F.  Traffic calming program. Traffic calming is the combination of mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle use, alter driver behavior and improve conditions for nonmotorized street users. The city has adopted Seminole County's Traffic Calming Program handbook which provides traffic calming procedures and measures. In addition to those traffic calming measure enumerated in the county handbook, the following measures may be approved by the city engineer: 
1.  Speed humps and speed tables. Speed humps and speed tables may be used where the purpose is to reduce speed and calm traffic provided they comply with the following (see Figures N-4a and N-4b): 
a.  Speed humps shall be parabolic, curved or sinusoidal in profile, three to four inches in height and 12 to 14 feet long. They shall be used to reduce speeds to no more than 15-20 mph. 
b.  Speed tables shall be flat-topped speed humps, also three to four inches high, but with a sloped approach taper on each side of a flat top, generally 20 to 24 feet wide. They shall be used to reduce speeds to no more than 20-25 mph. 
c.  Speed tables and humps shall be clearly marked with eight inch white thermaplast across the raised area and motorists have 50 feet of warning before each speed hump or table by signage either painted on the road or on a post adjacent to the roadway. 
2.  Speed bumps. Speed bumps shall not be used on public or private roadways in Sanford. Speed bumps are severe treatments three to six inches high and one to two feet wide that slow drivers to speeds of less than ten mph. Due to their abrupt rise and required low speed they can be a hazard to motorists and bicyclists. 
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 1.4. - General lot and block design requirements. 
A.  Area and dimensional requirements. All lots shall comply with applicable area and dimension requirements set forth in Schedules C, D, E, F and J of these land development regulations. 
B.  One- and two-family dwelling lots.

C.  Multiple-family dwelling and nonresidential use lots. Lots and tracts for multiple-family dwellings and/or nonresidential uses that are created after the effective date of this schedule shall have a minimum of 200 feet of linear frontage on an arterial or collector roadway in order to obtain direct vehicular access to such road. Lots and tracts with less than 200 feet of linear frontage on an arterial or collector roadway shall only have vehicular access to such arterial roadway through a system of common or shared vehicular access points whereby the minimum spacing between vehicular access points on an arterial is 200 feet. Such system of common or shared vehicular access points shall be subject to preliminary subdivision plan review procedures set forth in these land development regulations. 
D.  Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be, as nearly as practical, at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. 
E.  Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall be provided with sufficient width and depth to permit the establishment of appropriate building setback lines from both streets. 
F.  Double frontage lots. When it is necessary to design a residential subdivision that abuts an arterial or collector, it shall be designed to provide the through-lots along the arterial or collector with access from a frontage road or interior local road. Access rights of these lots to the arterial or collector shall be dedicated to the governmental entity having jurisdiction over the road and recorded with the deed. A decorative wall shall be required at the rear of through lots to buffer residences from traffic on the arterial or collector. The wall shall not be located within the public right-of-way. 
G.  Residential adjacent to railroads. Where a proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, it shall be planned so as to avoid having residential lots front on a street which runs parallel and adjacent to railroad right-of-way. 
H.  Block length. The maximum block length shall be 1,200 feet. 
I.  Water access. In general, canals and waterways for the purpose of providing access by water to lots within a subdivision shall be prohibited.

If found in conformance, a final use permit shall be issued. 
D.  No building permit shall be issued for any lot served by a private road until the private road has been constructed and approved, so that all lots to be served by the private road have access to a public road. A road maintenance agreement, prepared by the developer and approved by the city attorney shall be recorded with the deed of each property to be served by a common private road. The agreement shall provide, at a minimum, for: 
1.  A method to initiate and finance a private road and maintain that road in good condition; 
2.  A method of apportioning maintenance costs to current and future users; 
3.  A provision that the city may inspect, and if necessary, require that repairs be made to the private road to ensure that safe access is maintained for emergency vehicles. If required repairs are not made within 60 days of date of notice, the city may make the necessary repairs and assess owners of parcels on the road for the cost of all improvements plus an administrative fee, not to exceed 25 percent of total costs; 
4.  A provision that the majority vote of all property owners on the road shall determine how the road is maintained except in the case of emergency repairs as outlined above; 
5.  A statement that no public funds shall be used to construct repair or maintain the road. 
6.  A provision requiring mandatory upgrading of the roadway if additional parcels are added to reach the specified thresholds; and 
7.  A provision that property owners along that road are prohibited from restricting or in any manner interfering with normal ingress and egress by any other owners or persons needing to access properties with frontage on that road. 
F.  No private road shall be considered for incorporation into the public road system unless it is built to public road specifications of the City of Sanford and in good condition at the time of the request. The property owners shall be responsible for bringing the road into conformance. Roadways constructed in conjunction with multifamily or townhouse developments shall not become a part of the public road system of the City of Sanford whether or not they conform to the city's public roadway specifications. 
G.  An application fee will be established by the administrative official to cover administrative, processing, and inspection costs. 
H.  All purchasers of property served by a private road shall, prior to final sale, be notified that the property receives access from a private road that shall be maintained collectively by all property owners along that road; that the City of Sanford shall not be held responsible for maintaining or improving the private road; and that a right-of way easement to provide the only access to that property has been recorded in the deed for that property.

K.  Automatic gates shall have battery back up power. 
L.  The entryway gate must include a box, labeled "City of Sanford," with a master-keyed padlock, and the box must contain a key, a card-key, a code, a remote-control device, or some other means by which mosquito control, animal control, code enforcement, environmental protection and utility workers may gain access to the subdivision. The means of access is subject to approval by the city and the box must be installed prior to the city's issuance of the Certificate of Completion for the subdivision infrastructure. If a key pad is used, there shall be a four digit code set aside for the Sanford fire department. The code shall be determined by the fire department. A 'Knox' box to override gate access is also required as a back-up system. Any other utilities serving the subdivision must have similar access, and the names of such utilities must be on the outside of the box containing the means of access. 
M.  From the date of the adoption of the ordinance creating this section through December 31, 2008, the conditions set forth in subsection (F) of Section 1.5 of Schedule N are suspended for private rights-of-way applicants seeking consideration for dedication and incorporation into the public road system. Private rights-of-way shall be considered for dedication and incorporation into the public road system upon completion of an application process established by the city manager or his designee and approval from the city manager or his designee. The city commission has authorized this initiative to dedicate and incorporate private rights-of-way into the public system that do not comply with the standards required by subsection (F) of Section 1.5 of Schedule N to ensure emergency access by public servants to all of the citizenry and to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the populace. All applications for incorporation shall be considered upon the receipt of a complete application and administrative fees by the city clerk. 
This ordinance does not guarantee incorporation of the private right-of-way into the public system and acceptance is contingent upon compliance with all other conditions determined by the city manager or his designee. Any applicants aggrieved by a decision of the city manager or his designee pursuant to this section may appeal the decision to the city commission. An aggrieved party may appeal a final order of the city commission to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the city commission. An appeal shall be filed within 20 days of the execution of the order to be appealed.

When utilized, pedestrian easements shall include sidewalks. In addition, pedestrian easements may be utilized as an alternative location for sidewalks located in rights-of-way if approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and provided that minimum right-of-way requirements are provided. 
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 2.2. - Sidewalk construction requirements. 
A.  Sidewalk. Sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland concrete with a minimum strength of 3,000 p.s.i. and a minimum thickness of four inches except at vehicular access points or driveways in which case sidewalks shall be a minimum of six inches thick. However, sidewalks at street intersections shall be ramped with a maximum slope ratio of 1 to 12. 
B.  Sidewalk subgrade. Excavation shall be made to the required depth and the subgrade or base upon which the sidewalk is to be set shall be compacted to a firm, even surface, true to grade and cross section, by means of watering, rolling or tamping. The subgrade shall be compacted to 95 percent compaction, Florida Bearing Value and shall be moist at the time the concrete is placed. 
C.  Expansion joints. Traverse expansion joints shall be constructed at intervals of 30 feet. Slabs shall be separated by traverse premolded expansion joint filler one-quarter inch thick for the full width of the slab, extending from the bottom of the slab to one-quarter inch of its top surface. 
1.  The slab between expansion joints shall be divided into sections five feet in length by traverse contraction joints formed by a jointing tool. Contraction joints shall be a minimum of one and one-half inches deep. Where slabs are more than seven feet in width, control joints shall be formed longitudinally to secure uniform blocks approximately square. 
The contractor may use open type of sawed contraction joints: 
a.  Open-type joints: Form open type contraction joints by staking a metal bulkhead in place and depositing the concrete on both sides. After the concrete has set sufficiently to preserve the width and shape of the joint, remove the bulkhead. After finishing the sidewalk over the joint, edge the slot with a tool having a one-half inch radius. 
b.  Sawed joints: If electing to saw the contraction joints, cut a slot approximately three-sixteenths inch wide and not less than one-half inches deep with a concrete saw after the concrete has set, and within the following periods of time: joints at not more than 20 foot intervals: within 12 hours after finishing; remaining joints: within 96 hours after finishing. 
2.  Expansion joints shall be formed around all appurtenances such as manholes, utility poles, etc. extending into and through the sidewalks. Premolded expansion joint filler one-quarter inch thick shall be installed at these joints. 
D.  Finishing. Provide the concrete with a broom finish. Ensure that the surface variations are not more than one-quarter inch under a ten-foot straightedge, or more than one-eight inch on a five-foot transverse section. Finish the edge of the sidewalk with an edging tool having a radius of one-half inch. 
E.  Curb ramps and detectable warning surfaces. Detectable warnings are intended to warn people with visual disabilities using a curb ramp before they enter the path of motor vehicles on the street or alleys (not at driveways) and before crossing railroad tracks. 
1.  Applicability. Curb ramps conforming to Americans with Disability Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) shall be installed when an alteration to a street or sidewalk occurs or when a new sidewalk is constructed. Ramps will be installed or upgraded at all legal crossings within the limits of grind and pave contracts. Existing ramps will be removed and new ramps constructed where the existing ramp: 
a.  Does not currently conform to the Americans with Disability Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) but it is technically feasible to conform; or 
b.  Surfaces are brick pavers; or 
c.  Existing concrete is not sound. 
2.  Plan requirements. All new construction shall be designed on plan drawings to verify that a design conforms to ADAAG. This requires a working drawing that shows existing and proposed curbs, pavement markings, traffic control signs, traffic signals, elevations (gutter, top of curb, ramp and sidewalk), dimensions, R/W lines, trees, street furniture, inlets, parking meters and utility covers. The city reserves the right to request this information (drawn at 1? = 10') be submitted prior to approval of construction drawings and permits. Alterations are typically designed in the field and do not include design drawings to verify that ADAAG requirements are satisfied. It is the responsibility of the contractor and field engineer to verify that the "most useable" solution is constructed. 
3.  Contrast. In addition to the ADAAG requirements for contrasting colored surfaces, safety yellow shall not be the contrasting color due to aesthetic reasons. In addition, since dogs perceive black as a hole and walk around black pavement, black is not an acceptable color for detectable warning surfaces. The surface will be red or brick-red in color. 
4.  Types of detectable warning surfaces to be installed: 
Detectable Warning, Type B-Detectable warnings in new ramp construction will consist of pre-cast clay or ceramic paving bricks on a one and one-quarter sand bed on a five inch concrete base. Three and one-half high forms (nominal 2x4 lumber) are used to create a tub for the bricks to sit in. 
Detectable Warning, Type O-Existing concrete ramps that conform to ADAAG and have sound concrete may be overlaid with a truncated dome product. The product consists of: 
1.  Concrete preparation, base coat of polyurethane, preformed domes with adhesive, and three coats of polyurethane top coat. 
2.  Formed and poured modified structural repair mortar domes applied directly on concrete walk with coated with a pigmented sealer. 
3.  Plastic (monomer and resin) domes melted with a catalyst onto the concrete surface.

C.  Fill. All fill material required to bring the grade up to the specified profile grade line shall be suitable material that is free of trash, wood, roots, used concrete or other matter or material that would later be a detriment to the stability of the road bed or prevent sufficient compaction. The fill shall be placed in successive layers of not more than six inches for the full width of the cross section and each layer shall be compacted to a density as to prevent the later deterioration, settling or failure of the pavement. No subgrade is to be covered where the density is found to be less than 98 per cent of the maximum density as determined by AASHTO-180. 
D.  Sub-base. Sub-base means that portion of the roadbed immediately below the base course, the limits of which customarily include those portions of the roadbed shown in the plans to be constructed to a specific bearing value. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative official, the subgrade section shall be considered to extend to 12 inches below the bottom of the base and 12 inches beyond the base on each side. Subgrade shall extend 12 inches beyond the back of the curb and gutter.

Section 4.1. - Auxiliary lanes (right and left turn lanes). 
    The principal thrust in the development of marginal access standards is to reduce conflict between driveway entrances and through traffic. One method of reducing conflict is to provide a refuge area where vehicles can leave the through traffic lanes, slow down and accomplish the turn. Auxiliary lanes, as defined below, provide that capability and consequently may be required based upon the speed of the accessed roadway, the development's projected right and left turn volumes, and/or construction conflicts with existing drives/streets/roads. 
A.  Requirements. A right turn section is required on roadways of 40 mph and greater and/or development with a daily trip end rate of 500 ADT or greater. 
A left turn lane section is required for any development that accesses a classified road of minor collector and above or has a posted speed of 35 mph or higher. An inbound radius of 50 feet at development of higher, or a daily trip end rate of 500 ADT or higher, then a right turn section will be additionally required. 
Additionally, if either terminus of the of the proposed auxiliary lane section is within 300 feet from existing auxiliary lane terminus than a total 36 foot section is required to eliminate weaving or "Hour Glass" sections. See Figure N-7, Taper Striping Details, for design and markings specifications. 
B.  Figure N-8, Auxiliary Lane(s) Detail illustrates typical taper dimensions "A". A taper refers to the triangular paved surface that transitions the highway pavement to accommodate an auxiliary lane or a 36-foot wide pavement surface with markings identifying the transition area for the same purpose. 
The length of the taper is based on a roadway's design speed; i.e. L = Speed x Width. Examples of taper length are given for different design speeds in Figure N-8, Recommended Taper Length for Various Design Speeds. Storage lanes, labeled "B" and "C" in Figure N-8, are the 12-foot "refuge" area used to accomplish a right or left turn without impeding traffic. The storage and tapers combine to form either the right or left turn lanes. The length is determined as shown in Figure N-8. 
C.  Exceptions. The administrative official has the authority to adjust the requirements due to right-of-way constraints.

3.  For developments that request more than one two-way driveway, based upon parcel size, projected trip generation of the site, amount of roadway frontage and other appropriate design considerations, additional driveways may be permitted if all other provisions of the standards are met. 
E.  Driveway design. Driveway design will vary depending upon a number of conditions including functional classification of the accessed roadway, land use requiring the driveway, projected ADT and/or peak hour traffic using the driveway, vehicle type(s) using the driveway, speed limit of accessed roadway and other design features of the site itself or surrounding area. See N-9 for a detail of driveway design.

A.  Maintain pre-development conditions. In general, neither the rate nor the quantity of stormwater runoff shall be increased. 
B.  Provide necessary facilities. All site alteration activities shall provide for such water retention and settling structures and flow-attenuation devices as may be necessary to insure that the foregoing standards and requirements are met. 
C.  Nonstructural approach preferred. When possible, the nonstructural approach shall be used to meet both surface water quantity and quality requirements. 
D.  Stand-alone systems. The drainage system for each phase of a development shall meet the requirements of these regulations. Such systems shall be functionally independent of planned but unbuilt phases of the development project in question. 
E.  Upstream runoff. The drainage system for each development shall be sized to accommodate existing upstream runoff. 
F.  Maintain existing surface drainage. Site alteration shall not adversely affect existing surface water flow pattern. To the extent feasible, drainage sub-basin boundaries shall be maintained. 
G.  Steep ditches prohibited. Open drainageways with slopes of greater than three to one shall be prohibited. 
H.  Natural drainageways and watercourses. Developments that contain an existing natural drainage or watercourse, related floodplain and adjacent vegetation shall maintain and incorporate such features into the project design. Drainage system design shall insure that sediment from runoff will not enter such natural drainage. 
I.  Rates and volumes of runoff. Permitted rates and volumes of stormwater runoff, whether discharged into natural or artificial watercourses, shall meet existing water quality standards at the first downstream receiving water body for which such standards have been established. 
J.  Prevent adverse impact. Site alteration shall not cause siltation of wetlands, pollution of downstream wetlands or reduce the natural retention or filtering capabilities of wetlands. 
K.  Maximize recharge. The parcel shall be developed to maximize the amount of natural rainfall which is infiltrated into the soil and to minimize direct overland runoff into adjoining streets and watercourses. Stormwater runoff from roofs and other impervious surfaces shall be diverted into swales or terraces on the lot when possible. 
L.  Overland flow. To the extent feasible runoff from impervious areas shall be diverted so as to flow over vegetated areas prior to flowing into gutters, storm drains and retention areas.

Section 2.1. - Retention facilities. 
    Retention systems. Retention systems are designed to prevent the discharge of a given volume of stormwater runoff into surface waters in the state by complete on-site storage. Examples may include excavated or natural depression storage areas, pervious pavement with subgrade, or aboveground storage areas. 
    Retention systems shall comply with the following requirements. 
A.  Dedicated retention pond plat. Retention ponds within platted subdivisions shall not be dedicated or conveyed in the form of an easement but rather shall be platted as a separate tract of land dedicated to the entity responsible for maintenance. 
B.  Redeveloped sites. Alterations, expansions and activities which do not cause an increase or net decrease in impervious area shall be required to comply only with paragraph D., immediately below, of this section. 
C.  Post-storm capacity. Unless retention ponds are approved as a water feature or other similar special facility, such retention facilities shall be designed to insure dry bottom within 72 hours after the design storm event. Dry bottom shall mean the absence of standing water. The storage volume must be provided by a decrease of stored water caused only by percolation through soil, evaporation or evapotranspiration. 
D.  Retention of first half-inch runoff. Provide for either of the following: 
1.  Off-line retention of the first one-half inch of runoff or 1.25 inches of runoff from the impervious area, whichever is greater; or

In all cases, retention facilities shall be designed considering the event of a possible overflow. A path for such overflow shall be determined and structures in the development so situated that no flood damage shall occur either on-site or off-site. 
When the outfall structure employs a weir within an inlet to control the water surface (diversion box), the structure shall be oversized and provide an access manhole or grate on either side of the weir. Outfall structures shall be designed to prevent floating materials and oils from being discharged into the receiving waters. 
9.  Design without positive outfall. Developments without a positive outfall for discharge shall retain all runoff resulting from the design storm as computed for the developed condition. 
Section 2.2. - Wet detention stormwater management system. 
    Wet detention systems collect and temporarily store stormwater in a permanently wet impoundment in such a manner as to provide for treatment though physical, chemical, and biological processes with subsequent gradual release of the stormwater. 
    Wet detention stormwater management systems shall comply with the following requirements: 
A.  Dedicated retention pond plat. Retention ponds within platted subdivisions shall not be dedicated or conveyed in the form of an easement but rather shall be platted as a separate tract of land dedicated to the entity responsible for maintenance.

The location of the structure and the shape of the pond shall be designed such that no "short-circuiting" of the flow occurs and that maximum disposition of suspended solids is achieved. 
When the outfall structure employs a weir within an inlet to control the water surface (diversion box), the structure shall be oversized and provide an access manhole or grate on either side of the weir. Outfall structures shall be designed to prevent floating materials and oils from being discharged into the receiving waters. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative official, outfall structures shall be as simple as possible and shall employ fixed control elevations (i.e., no valves, removable weirs, pumps, etc.). 
The outfall structure shall be required to limit peak off-site discharges to pre-development rates. The structure shall be the discharge point for the filtration system. 
Detention ponds shall be designed so that the outfall structures shall bleed down 50 percent the volume of stormwater specified in paragraph A. [C.], immediately above, within 48 to 60 hours following a storm event, but no more than one-half of this volume will be discharged within the first 48 hours. 
E.  Design without positive outfall. Developments without a positive outfall for discharge shall retain all runoff resulting from the design storm as computed for the developed condition.

2.  The treatment volume should not cause the pond level to rise more than 18 inches above the control elevation unless the applicant affirmatively demonstrates that the littoral zone vegetation can survive at greater depths. 
3.  Eighty percent coverage of the littoral zone by suitable aquatic plants is required within the first 24 months of completion of the system or as specified by permit conditions. 
4.  To meet the 80 percent coverage requirement, planting of the littoral zone is recommended. As an alternative, portions of the littoral zone may be established by placement of wetland topsoils (at least a four-inch depth) containing a seed source of desirable native plants. When utilizing this alternative, the littoral zone must be stabilized by mulching or other means and at least the portion of the littoral zone within 25 feet of the inlet and outlet structures must be planted. 
5.  In lieu of littoral zone. In lieu of the requirements of paragraph H., above, the applicant may provide either of the following: 
i.  At least 50 percent additional permanent pool volume over that specified in paragraph G., above; or

Be designed so that the mean depth of the permanent pool is between two and eight feet and the maximum depth does not exceed 12 feet below the invert of the bleed-down device, unless the applicant affirmatively demonstrates that alternative depths will not inhibit the physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes or cause the resuspension of pollutants into the water column due to anaerobic conditions in the bottom sediments and water. 
J.  Flow paths. Be designed so the flow path through the pond has an average length-to-width ratio of at least 2:1. The alignment and location of inlets and outlets should be designed to maximize flow paths in the pond. If short flow paths are unavoidable, the effective flow path should be increased by adding diversion barriers such as islands, peninsulas, or baffles to the pond. Inlet structures shall be designed to dissipate the energy of water entering the pond. 
K.  Bleed-down devices. Be designed so that bleed-down devices incorporating dimensions smaller than three inches minimum width or less than 20 degrees for "V" notches shall include a device to eliminate clogging. Examples include baffles, grates, and pipe elbows. 
L.  Location of bleed-down devices. Be designed so that bleed-down structure invert elevations are at or above the estimated post-development normal groundwater table elevation. If the structure is proposed to be set below this elevation, groundwater inflow must be considered in the drawdown calculations, calculation of average residence time, estimated normal water level in the pond, and pollution removal efficiency of the system. Proposed peak discharge resulting from the design storm for the parcel shall not exceed pre-development peak discharge for the parcel in question.

1.  Reducing the design percolation rate by half; 
2.  Doubling the length of the filtration system; or 
3.  Designing for the required drawdown within 36 hours instead of 72 hours. 
G.  Invert elevation of the perforated pipe. Be designed so that invert elevation of the perforated pipe is above the seasonal high groundwater table elevation.

1.  Outfall criteria. Detention with filtration ponds shall be required to have an outfall structure, except where deemed unnecessary by the administrative official. The location of the structure and the shape of the pond shall be designed such that no "short-circuiting" of the flow occurs and that maximum disposition of suspended solids is achieved. 
When the outfall structure employs a weir within an inlet to control the water surface (diversion box), the structure shall be oversized and provide an access manhole or grate on either side of the weir. Outfall structures shall be designed to prevent floating materials and oils from being discharged into the receiving waters. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative official, outfall structures shall be as simple as possible and shall employ fixed control elevations (i.e., no valves, removable weirs, pumps, etc.). 
The outfall structure shall be required to limit peak off-site discharges to pre-development rates. The structure shall be the discharge point for the filtration system. 
Detention with filtration ponds shall be designed to attenuate peak outflows to pre-development rates and to provide filtration for the pollution abatement volume.

Section 2.5. - Underdrain stormwater management systems. 
    Underdrain is a drainage system installed beneath a stormwater holding area to improve the infiltration and percolation characteristics of the natural soil when permeability is restricted due to periodic high water table conditions or the presence of layers of fine textured soil below the bottom of the holding area. These systems usually consist of a system of interconnected below-ground conduits such as perforated pipe, which simultaneously limit the water table elevation and intercept, collect, and convey stormwater which has percolated though the soil. 
    Natural environmental features in the City of Sanford primarily associated with soil limitations and high groundwater conditions normally necessitate the provision of underdrains in order to comply with these drainage requirements. As such the following requirements shall apply to underdrains. 
A.  Runoff. Pollution abatement shall be accomplished by providing for either of the following: 
1.  Off-line storage of the first one-half inch of runoff or 11/4 inches of runoff from the impervious area, whichever is greater; or 
2.  On-line storage of an additional one-half inch of runoff over that volume specified in subparagraph A.1, above. 
Underdrain systems may contain areas of standing water only following a rainfall. 
B.  Post-storm capacity. Provide the capacity for the specified treatment volume of stormwater within 72 hours following a storm event. The storage volume must be provided by a decrease of stored water caused only by percolation through soil with subsequent transport through the underdrain pipes, evaporation or evapotranspiration. 
C.  Safety factor. Be designed with a safety factor of at least two unless the applicant affirmatively demonstrates based on plans, test results, calculations or other information that a lower safety factor is appropriate for the specific site conditions. Examples of how to apply this factor include but are not limited to reducing the design percolation rate by half or designing for the required drawdown within 36 hours instead of 72 hours.

Cross reference- Utilities, ch. 102. 

Section 1.0. - General. 
    Detailed standards and specifications for the design and construction of potable water, wastewater, and reclaimed water facilities and alternative water supply that are to be constructed within, dedicated to, owned by, maintained by, or operated by the City shall be contained within the Utilities Standards and Specifications Manual, herein referred to as the "Utilities Manual." 
    The Utilities Manual shall be adopted and revised from time to time by a separate City resolution so as to provide the appropriate flexibility in its application in order for the City to be responsive to site specific considerations, changes in technology, and emerging concepts. 
(Ord. No. 3325, §§ 2, 3, 5-12-1997; Ord. No. 3932, § 1.0, 5-9-2005; Ord. No. 3945, § 3, 7-25-2005) 
Section 2.0. - Reclaimed water system. 
    In order to protect water resources and ensure that groundwater supplies are adequate to meet potable water demand, all new development shall comply with the following regulations: 
A.  Applicability. In accordance with the most recent edition of the City's Reclaimed Water and Cross Connection Control Policy and with Section 62-610, Part III, Florida Administrative Code, all new developments shall utilize the City's reclaimed water system for irrigation and other uses that do not require potable water. Reclaimed water facilities and alternative water supply shall be independent of all potable water, raw water supply, wastewater, and storm water systems. Materials used in the installation and construction of reclaimed water systems shall be the same as that used for potable water facilities, with the exception of the color-coding, and shall be as specifically described in the City's Utilities Manual. 
B.  Evaluation. For all new developments, the Utilities Director shall evaluate the need of the development to incorporate the use of reclaimed water. The Director shall review the take-back capacity of the proposed development to determine if connection to the reclaimed water system represents a benefit to the City. The developer's engineer shall place all take-back calculations, based on City approved wastewater flow quantities, on the development plans. Reclaimed water usage shall equal or exceed anticipated wastewater flows. 
If a required irrigation system will have a negative impact on environmental systems or is inconsistent with the rules of other regulatory jurisdictions, the Utilities Director may approve an alternative irrigation system. 
_____ 
C.  Mandatory Connection. Upon completion of the evaluation, the Utilities Director shall have the authority to require the development, including all individual lots and tracts therein, to connect to the reclaimed water system. A fully automatic reclaimed water irrigation system and alternative water supply shall serve all landscaped and sodded areas of the development, including all adjacent rights-of-way and alleys. This requirement shall also apply to each lot and tract of a subdivided development. 
The developer shall be responsible for all costs necessary to provide on-site distribution and off-site transmission to the development. Connection to the City's reclaim water system is mandatory under the following schedule. Distances shall be measured along public rights-of-way, alleys, easements and railroad rights-of way. Connection distances and minimum line sizes are shown in the table below. The developer shall provide a master irrigation meter for town home and multi-family units.

_____ 
D.  Alternative Water Supply System. 
(1)  If reclaimed water is available within the distances listed above, a new development shall be required to connect to the City's system. Developments that are not required to connect to an existing reclaimed water line and which choose not to connect shall be required to connect to an alternative water supply source for irrigation purposes. 
(2)  The alternative water supply shall be a shallow or brackish well or storm water and all irrigation lines shall be capable of connecting to the City's reclaimed water system. The developer shall be responsible for all costs necessary to provide an alternative water dual distribution and supply system. The City will not provide a separate potable irrigation meter for new or existing developments, including individual residences that are not required to connect to the City's reclaimed water system pursuant of Section 2.0 C. of this Schedule and cannot provide an alternative water source. 
(3)  The City may, if it desires to accept ownership in its sole discretion, own such part or all of any alternative water dual distribution and supply system for residential subdivisions, and other developments of commercial, industrial or other types which which system is located on the property owner's side of the point of service delivery (the onsite irrigation system). As a general rule, the City will obtain ownership and maintenance responsibility only for lines and systems that are not located on private property although the City may obtain the right to spray alternative water on such properties and may, also, impose an obligation upon a property owner to accept such delivery and use of alternative water. When the City determines that it desires to obtain any such rights, appropriate legal instruments of conveyance of such rights as may be desired by the City shall be provided by the developer to the City in a recordable form acceptable to the City and as approved by the City Attorney. Also, as a general rule, the City shall not accept any maintenance obligation for any irrigation system located on private property. Each home shall have an individual reclaim/alternative irrigation meter consistent with City standards. All legal costs and costs of recordation shall be borne by the developer. 
(4)  A customer may apply for a variance from the requirements of Subsections (1) through (3) of this Section. Such application shall be made and acted upon in accordance with the following provisions: 
(i)  A potable water irrigation meter may only be set on a single lot or parcel. 
(ii)  The application shall be in a form established by the Utility Director or designee. 
(iii)  The application shall be reviewed and acted upon by the Utility Director or designee. 
(iv)  The potable water irrigation meter must comply with all applicable land development regulations and City policies including, but not limited to: water budget plans, landscape techniques for conserving water, all pertinent utility specifications (i.e. cross connection controls, etc.), all pertinent conservation technology requirements (i.e. rain sensor, etc,), alternative water source feasibility calculation or analysis, all pertinent utility account requirements, all pertinent permits (including irrigation, electrical, etc.), all pertinent inspections (utility, building, etc.), and payment of all pertinent fees and charges. 
(v)  A potable water irrigation meter size shall be restricted to 1-inch or smaller. 
The City Commission shall establish an application fee and other appropriate fees by resolution until which time; however, fees shall be established by the City Manager, or designee. Appeals may be perfected in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 3932, § 2.0, 5-9-2005; Ord. No. 3945, § 3, 7-25-2005; Ord. No. 4261, § 1, 1-9-2012) 
Section 3.0. - Water budget plans. 
    All developers shall submit to the Utilities Department water budget plans prepared by a certified landscape architect or certified irrigation contractor that account for all water usage on a site. The plan must include, at a minimum, the water requirements for each landscaped or turfed area and plant location and selection. A copy of the irrigation and landscape plans shall be provided to the City and property owner. The developer shall familiarize the property owner with the proper operation of the irrigation system including the timer. Water management tools including, but not limited to, rain and soil sensors shall be incorporated into the irrigation system design. 
A.  Water Usage. For residential developments, the water budget plan must demonstrate that indoor/ outdoor potable usage does not exceed three hundred (300) gallons per day. Any additional outdoor usage must be addressed through an alternative water supplied irrigation. The plan must also include an assurance that the water budget plans are available to every prospective home buyer. 
For commercial, industrial and multifamily developments, the water budget plan must demonstrate compliance with the City's take-back reuse program for future growth and development. This program requires new developments that connect to the City's wastewater system to 'take-back' the same amount of highly treated effluent as generated by the developments. Effluent from developments will receive tertiary treatment, which can be used for non-potable water purposes such as irrigation. Projected water usage by fixture and/or component must be provided. 
B.  General Requirements for Irrigation Plans. All developments, whether on the City's reclaimed water system or on an alternative water system, shall submit an irrigation plan on a form supplied by the utilities department. The plan shall demonstrate compliance with the following: 
1.  An irrigation plan shall be required for each developed parcel, lot or tract and shall be approved by the utilities department. Irrigation plans shall be reviewed in conjunction with engineering plan review or improvement plan review or, in the case of a single residential lot, prior to the issue of a building permit. 
2.  All new irrigation systems shall have a rain sensor device. 
3.  The developer shall construct reclaimed water distribution facilities to the proposed development and to each lot and tract within said development. 
4.  A fully automatic irrigation system, utilizing reclaimed water, or an alternative water system shall be installed on every lot, parcel or tract that is to be developed and shall provide total irrigation coverage for all landscaping, including hedges, trees, and grassed areas. 
5.  A minimum horizontal separation of three (3) feet, (outside of pipe to outside of pipe) shall be maintained between reclaimed water facilities and alternative water supply and potable water or wastewater mains. 
6.  All construction requirements and materials shall comply with the latest version of the Utilities Manual. 
(Ord. No. 3932, § 3.0, 5-9-2005; Ord. No. 3945, § 3, 7-25-2005) 
Section 4.0. - Landscape techniques for conserving water. 
    At least twenty percent (20%) of all landscape material obtained from off-site sources for use on any site shall have a soil moisture range of 'dry', as characterized in the list of plants from St. Johns River Water Management District's publication: Waterwise Florida Landscape which document is incorporated herein by this reference thereto as if fully set forth herein verbatim. No more than forty percent (40%) of all plant material shall have a high water demand, characterized by 'moist' in Waterwise Florida Landscape. 
Plants shall be grouped according to their water needs and soil conditions. If plant placement is done correctly, once plants are established, little to no supplemental irrigation will be necessary: 
* Natural zone: In this area, place plants that have adapted to the wet and dry extremes of Florida's climate so that regular watering (once plants are established) won't be necessary, except during prolonged drought. 
* Drought-tolerant zone: In this area, place plants that can survive extended periods of time without rain or supplemental irrigation. 
* Oasis zone: In this area, place plants that may require some watering.

(Ord. No. 4114, § 2, 6-23-2008) 
Section 2.0. - Methodology for determining impacts on available capacity. 
A.  Roadways. In determining impacts on available capacity for roadways, the following criteria shall be used: 
1.  Residential development. For proposed residential development consisting of less than 50 dwelling units occurring in residential land use categories (excepting planned developments), the following trip generation rates shall be used to calculate the impact of the proposed development: 
Land Use Type Trips Per Day Single family 10 Multiple family 8 Mobile homes 4.814  
2.  Nonresidential development and mixed-use planned development (PD). For all other development categories allowed within the future land use element, the impacts of development shall be based on the peak-hour, peak direction trips associated with the land use designation in which the proposed development shall occur, using the most recent published edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers', Trip Generation Manual, or as may be subsequently updated. Internal capture rates may be considered in determining traffic volumes for mixed use developments; however, the applicant shall bear the burden of demonstrating any internal capture rates upon five percent of the total nonresidential trips. 
Roads analyzed shall include all links impacted by more than ten percent of the project traffic or receiving 500 trips per day, whichever is greater. 
Methodologies used to determine transportation concurrency shall be consistent with methodologies established in the FDOT LOS Guideline. 
3.  Optional methods and procedures. If the preliminary level of service information indicates a deficiency in capacity based on adopted level of service (LOS) standards (reference section 1.0 for adopted LOS standards for roadways), the developer has two alternatives: 
a.  Accept the level of service information as set forth in the comprehensive plan; 
b.  Prepare a more detailed alternative Highway Capacity Analysis as outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000, Transportation Research Board, National Research Councilor travel time and delay study following the procedures outlined by the Florida Department of Transportation, Traffic Engineering Office in its Manual for Uniform Traffic Studies. 
4.  Alternative methodologies. If the applicant chooses to do a more detailed analysis, the applicant shall provide an acceptable methodology for preparing an alternative analysis which has been approved by a professional competent in transportation planning and/or engineering. Such an alternative methodology must be presented to and approved by the administrative official. 
If the alternative methodology, after review and acceptance by the administrative official, indicates no deficiency in the capacity based on the adopted level of service standard, whereas the comprehensive plan indicates a deficiency in capacity based on the adopted level of service standard, the alternative methodology will be used. However, the city shall, at its discretion, reserve the option to have the methodology reviewed by a professional registered engineer or professional transportation planner prior to accepting the methodology. The cost for such review shall be born by the applicant after due notice from the city. 
The trip distribution shall be consistent with the presets of the approved trip generation model, i.e.: the Seminole County Trip Generation Model, the Orlando Urban Area Transportation Study (OUATS) Model, or another distribution model approved by the city. 
The impact area shall include adjacent roadway segments as determined by the administrative official. The applicant may seek alternative trip allocations together with a statement of trip allocation methodology consistent with professional standards established in one or more of the following documents: 
a.  Highway Capacity Manual 2000, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, 2000. 
b.  Florida Highway System Plan, "Traffic Analysis Procedures," Florida Department of Transportation, Bureau of Multi-Modal Systems Planning, most recent edition. 
c.  Florida Highway System Plan, "Level of Service Standards and Guidelines Manual," Florida Department of Transportation, most recent edition. 
d.  Trip Generation, 6 th Edition, Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
e.  Transportation and Land Development, Stover, Virgil G., Institute of Transportation Engineers, 1988. 
5.  Traffic analysis required where 500 or more trips are generated trips. All new developments which are anticipated to generate 500 or more trips per day shall be required to submit a traffic analysis prepared by a traffic engineer licensed in the State of Florida which identifies the development's impact on the city's transportation system. The city administrative official may also require the submission of a traffic analysis for developments that generate less the 500 trips per day if the site location, anticipated total trip generation, circulation patterns or other such factors warrant a more extensive review of traffic impacts. The traffic analysis shall include the following: 
i.  Total projected peak-hour trips for the proposed development. 
 Pass-by capture rate (commercial land uses only); 
 Internal capture rate (planned development only); 
 Peak-hour external trips based on ITE Trip Generation Manual most recent edition; and 
 Peak-hour directional projected vehicle trips on all segments of the arterial and collector street system which are adjacent to the development project or as determined necessary by the administrative official. 
ii.  Design capacity of the accessed road(s). 
iii.  Analysis of traffic distribution on the road network including all links impacted by more than ten percent of project traffic or 500 trips per day, whichever is greater. 
iv.  Necessary operational improvements to the city, county, or state maintained transportation system in order to maintain the appropriate level-of-service for the roadway. 
v.  Other related information as required by the city. 
vi.  Justification, including appropriate references, for the use of any trip generation rates, adjustments factors or traffic assignment methods not previously approved by the city. 
vii.  The latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual shall be used to calculate these estimates. Adjustments to these estimates may be made, based on special trip generation information supplied by the applicant. 
B.  Other facilities. The level of service standards for all concurrency facilities, except roadways and drainage, are based on population (or equivalent units of population) served. Therefore, the applicant shall provide the administrative official with the projected population to be served by the proposed development and describe how surface water management criteria shall be met. The demand on concurrency facilities generated by the applicant's development shall be determined as cited below. 
1.  Solid waste. The demand for solid waste collection and disposal capacity shall be determined by multiplying the city's solid waste level of service standard times the population (or equivalent units of population). Following is the city's solid waste level of service standard: 
Land Use Solid Waste 
Pounds per Unit of Population 
1996-20 Residential 2.18 Nonresidential 2.46  
2.  Potable water. The demand for potable water shall be determined by multiplying the city's potable water level of service standard (i.e., 161 gallons per capita per day) times the population (or equivalent units of population). In addition, the applicant shall ensure that the city's fire flow requirements (cited in section 1.0 of this schedule) shall be met. 
3.  Sanitary sewer. The demand for sanitary sewer collection and treatment capacity shall be determined by multiplying the city's sanitary sewer level of service standard of 147 gallons per capita per day by the population (or equivalent units of population). 
4.  Drainage. The applicant shall provide evidence demonstrating that the proposed project shall meet the city's adopted level of service standards for drainage cited in section 1.0 of this schedule. 
5.  Recreation area. The demand for recreation area shall be determined by multiplying the city's recreation area level of service standard of four acres per 1,000 population or .004 acres by each person served by the development. 
6.  See section 6.0 for determination of impacts on public school capacities. 
(Ord. No. 4114, § 4, 6-23-2008) 
Section 3.0. - Determination of available capacity. 
    For purposes of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by adding the cumulative total supply for each public facility component as cited below in subsections 3.0 A. and B. and subtracting cumulative total demand for each infrastructure component as cited below in subsection 3.0 C. 
A.  Indicators of available facility capacity (add): 
1.  Capacity of existing facility. The total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
2.  Capacity of committed new facility, excluding roadways. The total capacity of committed new facilities, if any, that will become available on or before the date a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development. The capacity of concurrency facilities may be counted and deemed concurrent only if the following standards are met: 
a.  The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued; or 
b.  The development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place concurrent with the impacts of development; or 
c.  The necessary public facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement to be in place concurrent with the impacts of development. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur. 
3.  Capacity of new roadways. The total capacity of new roadways, if any, that will become available on or before the date a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development. The capacity of new roadways may be counted and deemed concurrent only if the standards of subsection 3.0 A.2.a.-c. are met. In addition, roadway facilities will be deemed concurrent based on the adopted five-year capital improvements program and schedule which, as a minimum, satisfy the following criteria: 
a.  The five-year capital improvements program must include improvements necessary to correct any identified facility deficiencies and maintain adopted levels of service for existing and permitted development; and 
b.  The five-year capital improvements program must be a realistic, financially feasible program based on currently available revenue sources; and development orders will only be issued if the public facilities necessary to serve the development are programmed to commence and become available within the first three years of the five-year schedule of capital improvements. 
c.  The five-year capital improvements program must identify whether funding is for design, engineering, consultant fees, or construction and indicates, by funded year, how the dollars will be allocated; and 
d.  The five-year capital improvements program must identify both the year in which actual construction of the roadway project will commence together with the anticipated fiscal year at which time construction will be finalized and functional operation of the roadway facility begins. Actual construction and functional operation of the roadway facility must commence on or before the third year of the five-year schedule of capital improvements; and 
In the situation where scheduled projects occur in phases that become functionally operational at the completion of each separate individual phase, the commencement and completion dates for each independent phase will be identified in the five-year schedule of capital improvements; and 
e.  A plan amendment will be required in order to eliminate, defer or delay construction of any roadway facility or service which is needed to maintain the adopted level of service standard; and 
B.  Indicators of cumulative demand on facility capacities (subtract): 
1.  Existing demand based on existing development. The demand for service or facility created by existing development as provided by the administrative official or as documented in the City of Sanford Comprehensive Plan. 
2.  Demand to be generated by incomplete approved development. The demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments. 
(Ord. No. 4114, § 6, 6-23-2008) 
Section 4.0. - Transportation concurrency exception area (TCEA). 
    The following regulations apply to development located within the transportation concurrency exception area: 
A.  Purpose. The transportation concurrency exception area is established for the purpose of downtown revitalization where the enforcement of the concurrency management system will potentially conflict with revitalization of the Sanford downtown area. Transportation programs and improvements within the TCEA shall emphasize pedestrian and transit modes of transportation. 
B.  Applicability. The transportation concurrency exception area is hereby established within the geographical area depicted in Map II-8 of the 2001 City of Sanford Comprehensive Plan. Only areas located within the central business district, as delineated on the future land use map, may be incorporated into the TCEA. 
C.  Transportation concurrency exemption. Transportation concurrency requirements shall not apply to development or redevelopment within the TCEA. 
D.  Transportation demand management programs. The purpose of the transportation demand management program is to reduce the number of peak-period vehicle trips generated in association with development; promote and encourage the use of alternative transportation modes, such as ride sharing, carpools, vanpools, public transit, bicycles and walking; and provide those facilities that support such alternate modes. 
Prior to the issuance of any approval for development or redevelopment in the TCEA, all new employers in the TCEA with 50 or more employees shall establish employer-based transportation demand management programs. All programs shall be approved by the administrative official and set forth in a recorded development order or agreement. 
All transportation demand management programs shall include, at a minimum, any combination of the following methods which together achieve the purposes of the program: 
1.  Alternative work schedules/flex time; 
2.  Preferential parking for carpool and vanpool vehicles; 
3.  Bicycle parking, locker and/or shower facilities; 
4.  Information center for transportation alternatives including, but not limited to, current maps, routes, schedules for public transit, rideshare match lists; bicycle routes to the workplace; 
5.  Bus stop improvements; 
6.  On-site child care facilities; 
7.  Facilities and equipment to encourage tele-commuting; 
8.  Local transportation management and roadway improvements; 
9.  Transit incentives for employees such as subsidy of bus passes, additional pay for car-poolers, flexible work times, etc. 
10.  Plans for delivery of goods at off-peak hours; and 
11.  Plans and facilities for centralized deliveries of goods for multitenant facilities. 
E.  Transit facility evaluation. Prior to the issuance of any development approval for property within the TCEA, all applications for development or redevelopment which exceed 20,000 gross square feet shall submit proof of coordination with Lynx regarding transit facilities necessary to serve the development. The developer/property owner shall install improvements requested by Lynx unless otherwise waived by the administrative official. 
F.  Watercraft access. All retail commercial developments located adjacent to the waterfront and proposing boat dock facilities shall provide temporary public docking facilities for their customers. 
G.  Traffic impact monitoring. All applications for development or redevelopment located in the TCEA which meet the criteria of section 2.0 A.5. of this schedule shall submit a traffic impact analysis report pursuant to article VIII of the land development regulations. 
H.  Design standards for development located within the TCEA. The following design standards shall apply to all development and redevelopment within the TCEA: 
1.  Building orientation: The primary customer entrance of all commercial buildings shall be oriented to face a public right-of-way unless it can be shown that there are compelling site conditions that necessitate a different orientation. 
2.  Pedestrian circulation. Direct pedestrian linkages shall be provided from all building entrances to the surrounding streets, external sidewalks, transit stops and out parcels. Pedestrian ways shall be lighted throughout the site in a consistent and coordinated manner which provides safety and enhances the visual impact of the project on the community. Lighting shall be designed so as to prevent direct glare, light spillage and hazardous interference with automotive traffic on adjacent streets and all adjacent properties. 
3.  Bicycle parking facilities. All site plans for the development or redevelopment of a parcel of land located within the TCEA shall provide bicycle racks or other bicycle parking facilities for customers and employees unless it can be shown that there are compelling site conditions that prevent the installation of such facilities. 
4.  Streetscape design. All landscape and streetscape designs shall be compatible with pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities. Landscaping shall not interfere with the convenient access of pedestrians and cyclists to the parcel proposed for development or redevelopment and, to the greatest extent practical, the design of a site shall integrate pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems within landscaping plans. 
5.  Transit easements. All new development located within the TCEA shall be required to dedicate an easement to the City of Sanford or to Lynx necessary to allow the eventual provision of transit facilities including, but not limited to, benches, shelters, signage and bus turnouts if requested by Lynx and if a rational nexus is found relative to the impacts of the development and the easement is roughly proportional to those impacts. 
I.  Land use activities prohibited. Within the TCEA, the following automobile-based land uses shall be prohibited: 
1.  Drive-through facilities including restaurants and banks; 
2.  Automobile repair, service and sales; 
3.  Distribution centers; 
4.  Gas and service stations; 
5.  Car washes.

Section 5.0. - Proportionate fair-share mitigation of development impacts on transportation corridors. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the "City of Sanford Proportionate Fair-Share Program" or "PFSP", as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
B.  Legislative findings. 
1.  Transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and the city. 
2.  Transportation capacity is an integral part of the PFSP. 
3.  The PFSP provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors. 
4.  The PFSP allows developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair-share of the cost of a transportation facility. 
5.  The PFSP contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion; 
6.  The PFSP maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth, and may, in certain circumstances, allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element (CIE). 
C.  Applicability. The PFSP shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city's concurrency management system (CMS), including transportation facilities maintained by FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of subsection F. 
The PFSP does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in the city's Comprehensive Plan Objective 2-1.8: Transportation Concurrency Exception Area and Objective 8-1.4 Concurrency Management. 
D.  General requirements. 
1.  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the city's Comprehensive Plan and all applicable land development regulations. 
b.  The city's five-year capital improvement program (CIP) or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development. 
2.  The city may allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the PFSP by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development but is not contained in the CMS where one of the following apply: 
a.  The city adopts by resolution a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year CIP in the CIE of the city's Comprehensive Plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regular update. To qualify for consideration under this subsection, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city commission or its designee and must be determined to be financially feasible consistent with the city's Comprehensive Plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this section. Financial feasibility means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
b.  If the funds in the adopted five-year CIP are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the city may require a proportionate fair-share payment for another improvement which will, the city determines will significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year CIP of the city's Comprehensive Plan at the next annual CIE update. 
3.  Any improvement project proposed to meet a developer's fair-share obligation must meet generally accepted design standards of the jurisdiction that has responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the transportation facility. 
E.  Application process. 
1.  Upon notification of a failure to satisfy transportation concurrency, the administrative official shall notify the applicant in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the PFSP. 
2.  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held between the city and the developer to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), then the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) will be notified and invited to participate. If the impacted facility is maintained by another jurisdiction, then that jurisdiction will be notified and invited to participate. 
3.  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes, at a minimum and in addition to an application fee established by resolution of the city commission, the following: 
a.  Name, address, and phone number of owner, developer and agent; 
b.  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
c.  Legal description and survey of the property; 
d.  Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
e.  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
f.  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation methods. 
g.  If applicable, evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT if the facility is an SIS roadway or evidence of an agreement with the jurisdiction responsible for the maintenance of the roadway. 
h.  A proposed proportionate fair-share agreement prepared by the applicant including, but not be limited to, the amount of payment, description of work and timing of payment. 
4.  The application for a proportionate fair-share agreement shall be processed in conjunction with the development's application for development approval. The city attorney shall also review the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
F.  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
1.  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
2.  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
_____ 
3.  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
Proportionate Fair Share = s[ [(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: 
Development trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS. (Only those trips that trigger a deficiency are included.) 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per subsection F. 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
4.  For the purposes of determining proportionate share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIP, FDOT Work Plan or from the FDOT Transportation Costs Manual. For state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT Work Program, cost estimates shall be determined by the FDOT . 
5.  Improvement costs shall be escalated by the following formula: 
Cost n = Cost 0 X (1+ Cost _growth 3yr ) n 
Where: 
Cost n = The cost of the improvements in year n; 
Cost 0 = The cost of the improvement in the current year; 
Cost_growth 3yr = The cost over the last three years; 
n = The number of years until the improvement is constructed. 
The three-year growth rate shall be determined by the following formula: 
Cost_growth 3yr = [Cost_growth 1 + Cost_growth 2 + Cost_growth 3 ]/3 
Where: 
Cost_growth 3yr = The growth rate of costs over the last three years; 
Cost_growth -1 = The growth rate of costs in the previous year; 
Cost_growth -2 = The growth rate of costs two years prior; 
Cost_growth -3 = The growth rate of costs three years prior. 
_____ 
6.  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication by the fair market value established by an independent appraisal from an appraiser with MAI designation approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. 
G.  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
1.  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees if the proposed improvement is included in the city's CIP and is on the list of approved projects for arterial roads in the northern impact fee district in the most recent county impact fee ordinance and technical report. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair-share contribution is calculated. The city shall coordinate with Seminole County to determine the amount of the credit and the eligibility of the project. 
2.  Any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the city or otherwise. 
H.  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
1.  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate account for funding of scheduled improvements or transferred to the jurisdiction having responsibility for the transportation facility improvements. 
2.  In the event a facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection D.2.b. 
3.  The city shall coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving impacted regional facilities under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city through an interlocal agreement that establishes procedures for earmarking a developer's contribution for this purpose. 
I.  Intergovernmental coordination. Pursuant to policies in the intergovernmental coordination element of the city's Comprehensive Plan, the city shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation if the proposed development is located within one mile of an area which is under the jurisdiction, for transportation concurrency, of an adjacent local government. An interlocal agreement may be entered with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(Ord. No. 4114, § 10, 6-23-2008) 
Section 6.0. - Public school facility concurrency. 
A.  [Terms.] The following terms are used in discussing level of service standards for public schools: 
Permanent Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH): Meaning the permanent facilities within the inventory of land, buildings and rooms in public educational facilities used by the Florida Department of Education, Office of Educational Facilities; and 
Concurrency service area (CSA): A geographic unit promulgated by the school board and adopted by local governments within which the level of service is measured when an application for residential development is reviewed for school concurrency purposes. The CSA coincides with groupings of school attendance zones within each school type based on adjacency. 
Level of service (LOS) standard: A standard established to measure utilization of capacity within a concurrency service area (CSA). Current LOS within a CSA is determined by dividing the full-time equivalent student count (FTE) for the fall semester at the same type of schools by the permanent FISH capacity of the same type of schools. Projected or future LOS is determined by the dividing the projected enrolled students at the same type of schools within a CSA by the planned permanent FISH capacity of the same type of schools. 
B.  Use of concurrency service area (CSA) boundaries. The city shall apply school concurrency using CSA boundaries adopted by the school board. The CSAs are described geographically in Maps 1-3 of the support documents of the Comprehensive Plan and may be updated from time to time by the school board. 
C.  CSAs for each type of school. The CSA boundaries established by the school board will be based on clustered attendance zones for each school type (elementary, middle and high school) based on adjacency and will be reevaluated by the school board, as needed. 
D.  Development review process. The city shall withhold or condition the approval of any site plan, final subdivision, or functional equivalent for new residential units not exempted from concurrency until a school capacity availability letter determination (SCALD) has been issued by the school board to the city indicating that adequate school facilities exist or until a mitigation agreement has been reached, pursuant to the availability standard specified in F.S. § 163.3180(13)(e). 
E.  Notification of submittal of residential applications. The city shall notify the school board within 15 working days of receipt of any land use or development application having a residential component and will transmit submitted subdivision plans and site plans to the school board for their review. 
F.  Timing of concurrency review. The city shall require that all new residential development be reviewed for school concurrency prior to the issuance of development approval of a site plan, a final subdivision plan or the functional equivalent. 
G.  Residential uses exempt from the requirements of school concurrency. The following residential uses shall be exempt from the requirements of school concurrency: 
1.  All single family lots of record at the time the school concurrency implementing ordinance became effective on January 1, 2008. 
2.  Any new residential development that has a preliminary plat or site plan approval or the functional equivalent for a site specific development order prior to the commencement date of the school concurrency program on January 1, 2008. 
3.  Any amendment to a previously approved residential development which does not increase the number of dwelling units or change the type of dwelling units. 
4.  Any age-restricted community with no permanent residents under the age of 18 (a restrictive covenant limiting the age of residents to 18 and older shall be required). 
H.  Results of concurrency review. The city shall not deny development approval due to failure to achieve the adopted LOS for public school facilities when the following occurs: 
1.  Adequate school facilities are planned and will be in place or under construction within three years of the development approval. 
2.  The developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation proportionate to the demand for public school facilities consistent with the methodology below. 
I.  Proportionate share mitigation. In the event there is not available school capacity to support a development, the school board may entertain proportionate share mitigation options and, if accepted, shall enter into an enforceable and binding agreement with the developer to mitigate the impact from the development through the creation of additional school capacity. Proportionate share mitigation allows a developer to pay that portion of the cost of providing capacity in a school facility that is necessary to serve that particular development or redevelopment project. 
1.  When the anticipated student impacts from a proposed development cause the adopted LOS to be exceeded, the developer's proportionate share will be based on the number of additional student stations necessary to achieve the established LOS. The amount to be paid will be calculated by the cost per student station for elementary, middle and high school as determined and published by the State of Florida. 
2.  The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate share mitigation shall be as follows: 
Proportionate Share = ( 1 Development students - Available Capacity) x 2 Total Cost per student station 
Where: 
1 Development students = those students from the development that are assigned to a CSA and have triggered a deficiency of the available capacity. 
2 Total Cost = the cost per student station as determined and published by the State of Florida. 
3.  The applicant shall be allowed to enter a 90-day negotiation period with the school board in an effort to mitigate the impact from the development through the creation of additional capacity. Upon identification and acceptance of a mitigation option deemed financially feasible by the school board, the developer shall enter into a binding and enforceable development agreement with the school board. 
a.  A mitigation contribution provided by a developer to offset the impact of a residential development must be directed by the school board toward a school capacity project identified in the school board's five-year capital improvement plan. Capacity enhancing projects identified within the first three years of the five-year capital improvement plan shall be considered as committed. 
b.  If capacity projects are planned in years four or five of the school board's five-year capital improvement plan within the same CSA as the proposed residential development, the developer may pay his proportionate share to mitigate the proposed development. 
c.  If a capacity project does not exist in the capital improvement plan, the school board will add a capacity project to satisfy the impacts from a proposed residential development, if it is funded through the developer's proportionate share mitigation contributions. Mitigation options may include, but are not limited to: 
i.  Contribution of land or payment for land acquisition suitable for and in conjunction with, the provision of additional school capacity; or 
ii.  Mitigation banking based on the construction of a educational facility in exchange for the right to sell capacity credits; or 
iii.  Provide modular or permanent student stations acceptable for use as an educational facilities; or 
iv.  Provide additional student stations through the remodeling of existing buildings acceptable for use as an educational facility; or 
v.  Construction or expansion of permanent student stations at the impacted school within the CSA; or 
vi.  Construction of a educational facility in advance of the time set forth in the school board's five-year capital improvement plan. 
4.  For mitigation measures A. through F. above, the estimated cost to construct the mitigating capacity will reflect the estimated future construction costs at the time of the anticipated construction. Improvements contributed by the developer shall receive school impact fee credit. 
5.  Developer shall receive an impact fee credit for the proportionate share mitigation. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution was calculated. The portion of impact fees available for the credit will be based on the historic distribution of impact fee funds to the school type (elementary, middle, high) in the appropriate CSA. Impact fee credits shall be calculated at the same time as the applicant's proportionate share obligation is calculated. Any school impact fee credit based on proportionate fair share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the CSA. 
6.  A proportionate share mitigation contribution shall not be subsequently amended or refunded after final site plan or plat approval to reflect a reduction in planned or constructed residential density. 
7.  Impact fees shall be credited against the proportionate share mitigation total. 
8.  Any proportionate share mitigation must be directed by the school board toward a school capacity improvement identified in the school board's five-year capital improvement plan. 
9.  Upon conclusion of the negotiation period, a second determination letter shall be issued. If mitigation is agreed to, the school board shall issue a new determination letter approving the development subject to those mitigation measures agreed to by the local government, developer and the school board. Prior to, site plan approval, final subdivision approval or the functional equivalent, the mitigation measures shall be memorialized in an enforceable and binding agreement with the local government, the school board and the developer that specifically details mitigation provisions to be paid for by the developer and the relevant terms and conditions. If mitigation is not agreed to, the determination letter shall detail why any mitigation proposals were rejected and why the development is not in compliance with school concurrency requirements. A SCALD indicating either that adequate capacity is available, or that there is not a negotiated proportionate share mitigation settlement following the 90-day negotiation period constitutes final agency action by the school board for purposes of F.S. ch. 120. 
J.  Appeal process. A person substantially affected by a school board's adequate capacity determination made as a part of the school concurrency process may appeal such determination through the process provided in F.S. ch. 120.

    Runway. A defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
    Visual runway. A runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA-approved airport layout plan, a military service's approved military airport layout plan, or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority. 
(Ord. No. 3950, § 7(2.0), 8-8-2005) 
Section 3.0. - Airport zoning map. 
    In order to outline definitely the horizontal and vertical limits beyond which the projection of any structure or tree will constitute an airport hazard, the airport height zoning map of the Orlando Sanford International Airport, Sanford, Florida, attached to Ord. No. 3750, is hereby incorporated into this schedule and made a part hereof. 
(Ord. No. 3950, § 7(3.0), 8-8-2005) 
Section 4.0. - Airport height zones and limitations. 
(1)  Horizontal surface. The land lying under a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, 205 feet AMSL at Sanford. The perimeter of the horizontal zone at Orlando Sanford International Airport is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each end of runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. No structure shall be permitted in the horizontal zone that would exceed 150 feet above the established airport elevation as depicted on the airport height zoning map of Sanford, Florida. 
(2)  Conical zone. The land lying under a surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet at Orlando Sanford International Airport. The conical surface extends upward to an elevation of 405 AMSL. No structure shall be permitted in the conical zone that would penetrate the conical surface as depicted on the airport height zoning map of Sanford, Florida. 
(3)  Approach zones. The land lying under a surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each end of each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for the runway end and is depicted on the airport height zoning map of Sanford, Florida. 
(a)  The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface of each runway, 250 feet wide for runways 9C and 27C; and 1,000 feet wide for runways 9L, 9R, 27L, 27R, 18 and 36 at Orlando Sanford International Airport. The outer edge of the approach surface is: 
i.  1,250 for runways 9C and 27C. 
ii.  16,000 for runway 9L, 9R, 27L, 27R, 18 and 36. 
(b)  The approach zone extends for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet for runways 9C, 27C; and 50,000 feet for runway 9R, 9L, 27L, 27R, 18 and 36. 
(c)  The slopes of the approach zones are as follows: 
i.  20:1 for runways 9C and 27C. 
ii.  50:1 for the first 10,000 feet horizontal distance with an additional 12,000 feet horizontal distance at a slope of 40:1 until intersection with a plane 500 feet above the airport elevation for 28,000 feet for runways 9L, 27R, 9R, 27L, 18 and 36 as depicted on the airport height zoning map of Sanford, Florida. 
(d)  No structure shall be permitted in the approach zone that would penetrate the approach slope that runway, as depicted on the airport height zoning map of Sanford, Florida. 
(4)  Transitional zone. The land lying under surfaces extending outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 7:1 form the sides of the primary and approach surfaces. However, when the slope of 7:1 intersects a plane 500 feet above the established airport elevation, the transitional surface becomes a plane 500 feet above the established airport elevation as depicted on the airport height zoning map of Sanford, Florida.

However, a permit for a tree or structure of less that 75 feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal or conical zone or in any approach or transition zone beyond a horizontal distance or 5,000 feet from each end of the runway, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone. 
    Each such application shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted. 
(2)  Existing uses. Before any existing use, structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or replanted within any airport approach zone, horizontal zone, conical zone or transitional zone, a permit must be secured authorizing such replacement, change or repair from the administrative official or the planning and zoning commission. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation that it was on the effective date of this schedule or than it is when the application for a permit for replacement, change or repair of existing use, structure or tree shall be granted. 
(3)  Abandoned or destroyed nonconforming use or structure. Whenever the administrative official or the planning and zoning commission determines that a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned for a period of six months or is more than 80 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.

Section 4.0. - Criteria and procedures for establishing and expanding historic districts. 
    Criteria for creating local historic districts. Historic districts shall be consistent with the following criteria for designation: 
1.  The proposed districts, or properties within the area, are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad pattern of the history of the city, state or nation; or are associated with the lives of persons significant to the city, state or nation's past; or 
2.  The properties embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction or represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
3.  The area has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history (e.g. Indian burial mound); or 
4.  If based on architecture, there is a concentration of contributing buildings (see definition). The number of contributing buildings shall be no less than 50 percent of the total number of buildings within the district. 
    Procedures for establishing historic districts. The designation of historic districts shall be by ordinance adopted by the city commission, in accordance with the following procedures: 
1.  The process for designating a new historic district may be initiated by a property owner within the proposed district, by the historic preservation board, or by the city. 
2.  The applicant shall submit a written application to the city. The application shall contain the following: 
(a)  For applications initiated by property owners, a petition signed by at least 15 percent of the property owners within the proposed district. This requirement shall not apply to city or board-initiated applications. 
(b)  A physical description of the proposed district, accompanied by photographs of buildings, structures, objects, or sites showing examples of contributing and non-contributing properties within the district. 
(c)  A statement of the historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or other significance of the district (refer to section of the schedule where historic is defined). 
(d)  A report, prepared by a qualified professional, including a description of the typical architectural styles, character-defining features, and types of buildings, structures, objects or sites within the proposed district; the report shall identify which properties are contributing at the time. The list of contributing structures is intended to be a snapshot in time, since other properties will also become contributing as they turn 50 years old and are determined by a qualified professional to meet the criteria to become contributing. 
(e)  A map identifying all zoning and land use information, and the location of all buildings, structures, objects or sites within the proposed district, noting which are contributing, based on the definitions contained in this schedule. 
(f)  Additional guidelines to be used when reviewing alterations, relocation, demolition, excavation or new construction within the proposed boundaries of the district. 
(g)  Names and addresses of all property owners within the proposed district; and 
(h)  Any other pertinent information requested by the board. 
3.  Not less than 60 days after the transmittal, the board shall hold a public hearing, which shall include a written notice to the last known address of the owners of all properties to be included in the district(s). Such notice shall be distributed by first class mail. 
4.  After said public hearing, the board shall submit a final report with its recommendations and those of the planning and zoning commission and a draft of the proposed ordinance to the city commission. 
5.  The city commission shall act on the report and recommendations in accordance with the normal ordinance approval procedure as specified in the city code. 
    Criteria for expanding existing local historic districts. If an updated report shows that there are additional contributing structures outside of the original boundary of an existing district, then the city may consider the expansion of the boundaries of the district to incorporate those properties. The ratio of 50 percent contributing structures required for the creation of new districts shall still apply. 
    Procedures for expanding local historic districts. The expansion of existing historic districts shall be done by ordinance adopted by the city commission, in accordance with the same procedures required for the creation of new districts, except that the information required shall be applicable to the expansion area only, and not to the entire district.

Section 7.0. - Archaeological resources. 
    Identifying historic, archaeological and cultural resources is the initial step to preserving the city's historic heritage. Areas shall be investigated for archaeological resources prior to development. This section will provide for mitigation of adverse impacts to significant sites should they be discovered during the course of predevelopment investigation. 
A.  Human remains or archaeological resources. If human remains or archaeological resources are encountered during the course of construction, earth movement, clearing, or other site disturbance, all work shall immediately halt, for a period of time not to exceed 30 days, and the applicant or his/her representative shall immediately notify the city's administrative official and the state office of archaeology and historic preservation. 
If, after consultation with the state office of archaeology and historic preservation, an area is determined to contain archaeological resources, the city will designate the area as a preservation area by designation "PA" on an Archaeological Resources Map that is maintained in the planning department. No ground disturbance will be allowed within a preservation area. This designation shall not affect zoning. When human remains and/or archaeological resources have been completely removed from the property, the preservation area designation shall be removed. 
Any archaeological sites identified through the investigation process shall be incorporated as part of the Florida Master Site File Maps and Archaeological Sensitivity Zone Maps for the city and Seminole County. 
B.  Prospecting and excavations. 
1.  Private property. No individual shall be allowed to prospect on private property, nor can any individual remove artifacts from private property without the express written permission of the landowner.

Furthermore, no disturbances or construction activities shall be authorized within properties belonging to the city, including public streets and rights-of-way, without a city right-of-way permit and without such archaeology efforts as may be addressed by this ordinance. 
C.  Archaeological site report. If any construction, earth movement, clearing or other site disturbance is proposed to be located on a registered archaeological site, the property owner or project proponent shall engage a qualified professional archaeologist to investigate and submit a written report to the city regarding the location, condition and extent of the site, and any recommendations in regard to treatment. 
D.  Project approval and permit. No certificate of appropriateness for an application requiring an archeologist's report will be issued prior to the receipt of the archeologist's report by the city. Based on the information contained in the written report of the archeologist, project approval will be conditioned in a manner to avoid or minimize impacts to the site consistent with federal and state law. 
E.  Enforcement and penalties. Any person or entity violating any of the provisions of this article shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in Section 162.22, Florida Statutes. Each incident or separate occurrence of an act that violates this article shall be deemed a separate offense.

F.  Site planning. The planning and zoning commission shall review site plans for nonresidential and multiple family dwellings. However, all such plans located within historic districts shall be referred to the board for review and recommendation with sufficient time to communicate to the planning and zoning commission prior to the latter taking action. Site plans for single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings shall be reviewed by the board along with other related alterations and modifications to such properties, even in cases where planning and zoning review is not required. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required for site plans involving single family and two-family dwellings. 
G.  Appeal of board decision. Any person aggrieved by a determination of the board may appeal such determination to the city commission by filing a written appeal within 30 calendar days of the board action. The decision of the city commission on an appeal shall constitute final action. 
H.  Violations. Should a property owner or tenant fail to obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to making improvements/modifications to a structure or property located within a historic district or a historic landmark, or if a property owner or tenant performs work that is not in compliance with an approved certificate of appropriateness the city shall take the following action: 
1.  The property owner shall be required to apply for a certificate of appropriateness and shall be required to pay an application fee in addition to any other fee required by the land development fee schedule; 
2.  The board shall review the application as if it was a new alteration and not consider the fact that the alteration has already been initiated or completed. 
3.  If the certificate of appropriateness is denied, the owner shall comply with the regulations, even if it requires partial or total demolition of the improvements already made. Failure to obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking work and/or a violation to an approved certificate of appropriateness does not constitute grounds for economic hardship. 
When a certificate of appropriateness is necessary in order to respond to a code enforcement notice or citation, the property owner shall make application for a certificate of appropriateness within ten business days of the notice or citation and the violation shall be remedied within 45 days from the date of issuance of the certificate of appropriateness unless the historic preservation board or the administrative official grants a longer period of time upon a finding that unusual circumstances prevent, or legal proceedings necessitate, the remedy from occurring in a timely manner. 
When an obligation is imposed by this schedule or a prohibited act is set forth in this schedule, it is prohibited and unlawful to fail to conform to the provisions of this schedule. Violations may be enforced by appropriate proceedings before the board, by code enforcement action before the city's code enforcement special magistrate, or by any other means available under the controlling provisions of law.

(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 9.0. - Standards for new construction, additions and alterations. 
    In considering an application for certificate of appropriateness, the board shall adhere to the standards contained in this section. The purpose of these design standards is to ensure that all maintenance, alterations, and additions to structures in a historic district or to an historic landmark is in accordance with the character of the landmark or district. The design standards also ensure that new construction on the property of an historic landmark or within a historic district is in accordance with the character of the landmark or district. 
    Any request not specifically noted in this schedule, but requiring a building permit and determined by the administrative official to have an impact on a historic landmark or the exterior of a structure in a historic district shall be reviewed by the board using comparable standards from this schedule. 
A.  The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation are basic principles created by the National Park Service to help preserve the distinctive character of a historic building and its site, while allowing for reasonable change to meet new needs. These standards shall apply to all historic landmarks and contributing and non-contributing buildings within a designated historic district. The standards shall apply to the exterior of historic buildings of all periods, styles, types, materials, and sizes and shall also encompass related landscape features and the building's site and environment as well as attached, adjacent, or related new construction. 
The standards are applied to projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. 
1.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
2.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
3.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
4.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
5.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
6.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
7.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
8.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
9.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
10.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
B.  Architectural styles. Any alteration to an existing historic landmark or a structure within a historic district shall be consistent with its architectural style. Alterations to non-contributing structures within historic districts shall also be consistent with its style, if the style can be determined based on the style descriptions included in this section. Appendix A shows the main characteristics of the styles found in the city. 
C.  General standards for all properties. In order to ensure compliance with the Secretary of Interior Standards, the detailed standards contained in the following sections have been established to assist property owners and the board when designing/reviewing alterations to local historic landmarks or to existing structures within the city's local historic districts. The standards of Schedule S shall apply to all historic landmarks; and all properties within a designated historic district unless otherwise stated within the regulations. The standards apply to new construction as well as modifications to existing structures. 
Lot layout. New buildings, additions and alterations shall be designed so that the front facades of the buildings are closely aligned with other buildings on the block to maintain a uniform setback. 
a.  Residential lot layout. 
  Setbacks: Setbacks apply to both principal and accessory structures. Residential lot development shall have the following setbacks: 
Front yard: Twenty-five feet; 
Rear yard: Two feet; 
Side yard: Five feet; When a side yard is located adjacent to a street, the side yard setback shall be seven and one-half feet. 
In the case of an infill lot, the setbacks shall match one or the other of the existing setbacks on adjacent properties. 
 To protect the pedestrian character of the community and discourage front-loaded garages, new curb cuts are not allowed within the historic districts for properties that have alley access. 
 Driveways visible from the right-of-way may be surfaced with poured concrete, pavers, gravel or natural mulch, and must be confined by appropriate curbing. Driveways not visible from the right-of-way such as those accessed from the alley may be surfaced with concrete, pavers, gravel and mulch. 
 Additional parking spaces visible from the right-of-way must obtain approval from the board via a Certificate of Appropriateness and may not adversely impact the character of the building or surrounding historic district. 
 New open porches, balconies, stoops and bay windows shall be permitted to encroach into the front yard and side-corner setback by ten feet. 
 Where alleys are available, new garages shall be detached and located at the rear of the lot and shall be located no closer than 35 feet to the front property line and curb cuts shall not be allowed. 
 Where alleys are not available, the garages shall be detached and located behind the principal structure. Shared driveways are encouraged. 
 Vehicles shall not be parked in the front or side yards or in the right-of-way adjacent to any street unless on an approved driveway with a permitted curb cut. 
b.  Commercial lot layout. 
  Setback. New buildings within the Downtown Commercial District shall have a zero- to five-foot setback from the front property line. 
 Building facades within the Downtown Commercial Historic District shall extend along the street to a minimum of 90 percent of the lot width for interior lots, and 60 percent for corner lots. 
 Vacant lots may be secured with decorative black metal bollards and black metal chain or four inches by four inches painted wood posts with decorative caps and black metal chain. Bollards may not exceed four feet in height and must be spaced four feet apart except for alley access, where bollards may be spaced 12 feet apart. 
 Parking areas shall be located to the side and rear of the building. A secondary pedestrian entrance may be provided in the back of the business to provide direct customer access to the store from parking areas, or a walkway shall be provided to improve circulation between the parking lots and the street. Architectural embellishments, awnings, landscaping and signs shall be used to mark the secondary entrance. The design of the rear of the building shall be consistent with the front façade. 

 New buildings under 5,000 square feet in area shall be exempt from parking requirements. New buildings over 5,000 square feet in area shall be required to provide one space per 500 square feet of non-residential gross floor area over and above the initial 5,000 square feet plus one space per dwelling unit, if there is a residential component (mixed-use). The parking shall be located within 1,000 feet of the site. On-street parking spaces located along the lot frontage may be counted toward the parking requirements of this code. 
 In order to promote pedestrian activity and vibrancy of downtown, uses along Type A streets (as defined in Schedule U, Section 3) shall be limited to commercial retail on the first floor; residential, commercial, office, parking or lodging on the second floor; and residential, parking or lodging above. 
 Drive-through facilities shall not be allowed within historic districts. 
 Dumpsters shall be placed at an appropriate enclosure and the area around the dumpster must be kept free of any debris. 
Building form. 
a.  Standards for all structures. 
 New buildings and their components shall be compatible in scale with each other (size of windows and doors in relation to the façade), the human body (use building elements sized for human use), and neighboring structures (predominant scale). To achieve the appropriate scale, the height to width, length to width and solid to void ratios must be considered. The scale (height to width ratio) of a street-facing façade shall be compatible with and maintain the proportions established by the existing structures within the district. 
 To maintain the predominant scale and proportion in the district, new buildings, additions and alterations shall be designed so that elements of the building façade are aligned with the façade elements of the neighboring structures (e.g. windows, doors, canopies, storefronts, awnings, etc.). 
Contemporary Design 

 Contemporary design for new construction shall not be discouraged when such new construction is compatible with the size and scale of the property, neighborhood and immediate environment. 
 New construction shall create a sense of layers using steps, brackets, chimneys, vegetation, and other projecting elements to make the buildings look less massive. 
 All new buildings shall have the main entrance oriented to the principal street and in full view from the public right-of-way. 
 Alterations to historic landmarks and contributing structures within a historic district shall be consistent with the design, massing and scale of the existing structure and the surrounding area. 
 New development shall incorporate mailboxes into the design. The use of cluster mailboxes is prohibited and unlawful in the historic districts. 
 The width of new or altered buildings shall be consistent with the predominant building width in the surrounding neighborhood. Larger buildings shall be designed so their facades are divided into smaller elements that relate to those of the surrounding neighborhood. 
 The design of an existing non-contributing structure may be modernized or contain historical references, but shall not be redesigned to create a false historical appearance. 
 Additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would be unimpaired. 
b.  Residential building form. 
 In the residential historic district, the scale and massing of new structures and their architectural elements shall be similar to the contributing structures of similar use in the historic district. 
 New residential structures shall include a raised foundation to compliment the character of contributing structures in the district. 
 In the residential historic district, new buildings shall not exceed 35 feet in height. 

 Primary residential entries for new structures shall face the street and shall not be recessed more than six feet from the face of the primary façade. 
 New development must incorporate mailboxes into the design. Cluster mailboxes are prohibited in the historic districts. 
c.  Commercial building form. 
 New buildings shall be designed with architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest from the perspective of the pedestrian, as well as vehicular traffic. 
 New building placing and massing shall relate to nearby buildings and to the urban context. 
Yes 

No 

 New buildings and additions shall include substantial variation in massing such as changes in height and horizontal plane. Horizontal masses shall not exceed a height/width ratio of one to three (1:3) without a substantial architectural element that either projects up or away from the building, such as a tower bay, lattice, or other architectural feature. 
 Buildings in the commercial historic district shall not exceed four stories. Buildings at the corner of two streets may have embellishments at the corner that are proportionately higher. 
 Storefronts shall be built to integrate the display window with the door and sign area into a single construction. 
 The height of storefront openings in new buildings shall be similar to the storefront openings of the contributing buildings within the district. 
 For new construction, there shall be a visual differentiation, such as a change in material or texture, between the first and second story on a two-story building or between the two lower floors and the rest of the building on a building taller than two stories. The differentiation shall be at a height similar to the cornice lines or stringcourses of contributing structures in the historic district. 
 The scale and massing of the lower floors of new structures and their architectural elements shall be similar to contributing structures in the historic district. Any new structure that exceeds 50 linear feet along any street frontage shall minimize the façade's mass by adding projections and recesses to make the structure similar in scale to contributing structures in the historic district. 
 New buildings shall have a recognizable top consisting of, but not limited to, cornice treatments, roof overhangs with brackets, steeped parapets, richly textured materials and/or differently colored materials. Colored stripes are not acceptable as the only treatment. 
 Building monument signs shall be recessed in the façade and may not be applied to the face of the façade. 
 New building walls shall be enhanced by the use of vertical elements, articulation and landscaping to break the monotony. 
 Columns and other façade features shall be treated as a total unit and shall extend to the ground. 
 The first floors of new buildings, including structured parking, shall be designed to encourage pedestrian scale activity. 
 Primary customer entrances shall be clearly defined and highly visible through the use of architectural detail for all structures. 
 Mechanical units and their ancillary equipment shall not be visible from the right-of-way.

 Structural canopy supports shall be symmetrical across face of façade. 
 Protection from the sun and adverse weather conditions for patrons shall be considered for the entranceways. Overhangs/awnings shall be no less than three feet deep to function to protect pedestrians from inclement weather. 
 Fabric awnings located on the second story and above shall match in design, color, texture, dimensions, and other physical features. 
 The use of vinyl or plastic awnings is prohibited and unlawful. 
Building features. 
 The distinguishing original characteristics of an existing contributing building, structure or site shall not be destroyed. If replacement is necessary, the new building feature shall match the feature being replaced in composition, color, texture, proportion, style, profile and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements as seen on other buildings or structures in the area. 
 Alterations and additions to contributing structures shall be compatible with the color, material, and character of the structure, neighborhood or immediate environment. 
 Building features within new construction shall be compatible with the color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood and immediate environment. 
 Balconies within the commercial historic district shall be permitted to encroach into the public right-of-way up to three feet from the property line with the approval of the city engineer. 
 Basements and foundations, in addition to wall material, may be made of cast-in-place concrete of smooth construction or concrete masonry units, provided that they are given a cement wash where visible. 
 A material consistent with the style of the structure shall enclose the undercroft of decks and foundations with spaced piers. The material shall be slightly recessed from the façade of the building and shall not overlap or be flush with the outer surface of the original piers, supports or siding. 

 Posts, balconies, porches and bay windows, columns, piers and arches, shall use materials consistent with the style of the structure. Balconies shall be built of wrought iron or wood with the railing pattern subject to the approval of the board. 
 Chimneys shall have a minimum width of five feet at the ground floor, and a dimension of one and one-half feet in either direction above the roofline. The transition shall be tapered. 
Chimneys 

 Exterior chimneys and foundations shall be finished in brick, stone, or stucco only. 
 New or replacement brackets for cantilevers, and open balconies shall be made of brick, wood, stone or steel, if visible, consistent with the style of the structure. 
 Stoops may be made of brick, stucco, cast concrete or wood. 
Exterior walls/materials. 
 For new construction, additions and alterations, use the wall finish most acceptable for the architectural style (see Appendix A). 
 The use of synthetic materials is prohibited and unlawful for exterior wall surfaces with the exception of fiber cement siding, which may be approved by special development order for detached new construction only. 
 Synthetic materials can be allowed for trim details and architectural elements on new construction. 
 The following materials are generally acceptable for principal and accessory structures within the historic districts: 
i.  Wood clapboard, wood shingle, wood drop siding, wood board and batten siding or equal as determined by the board. 
ii.  Brick, stucco; and stone or cast stone. 
 Resurfacing existing historic landmarks or contributing buildings with new material that is inconsistent with the style of the building or was unavailable when the building was constructed, such as artificial stone, brick veneer, asbestos or asphalt shingles, rustic shakes, and vinyl or aluminum siding, shall be prohibited. In cases where artificial siding is currently in place, its removal is not necessary. An owner may retain the material or remove it. If the material is removed, however, it shall be replaced with historically appropriate materials. 
 When siding which is inconsistent with the style of the house is removed, either from the façade of a building or to re-open an enclosed porch, the original façade and the original fenestrations shall be documented prior to the commencement of any rehabilitation construction. 
 Application of non-historic exterior finishes which result in either the removal or covering of historical materials and details shall be prohibited. 
a)  Wood facades. Horizontal wood siding is the predominant exterior finish in the Sanford Residential Historic District. Important characteristics of wood siding that shall be considered in its repair or replacement are board size, width of exposure, length, and trim detail such as corner boards. 
 Existing wood siding, trim and details in good condition or repairable shall be retained. 
 Deteriorated wood shall be replaced with wood to match the existing wood in size, profile, shape and texture. 
 Any and all additions to wood sided structures shall match the existing siding in size, profile, shape, color, orientation and texture.

 Detailing of the wood, such as beveling or beading, shall not be removed. 
 Board width, length and exposure shall be preserved. 
b)  Masonry facades. Masonry exterior finishes and detailing such as brick, tile, stucco, coquina, and concrete block can also be found in the residential historic district. Masonry features are important to the historic character of buildings, such as brick cornices or terra cotta detailing, surface treatments, modeling, tooling, bonding patterns, joint size and color. 
 Existing masonry features that are important to defining the overall historical character of the building shall be retained if they are in good condition or repairable. Repair or replacement shall be made with materials duplicating the existing masonry in color, composition and texture. 
 Mortar joints shall be repointed only where there are obvious signs of deterioration such as disintegrating mortar, cracks in the mortar joints, loose bricks, damp walls or damaged plaster work. Repointing shall duplicate the existing mortar joints in size, composition, texture, color and structural strength. 
 Any and all additions to stuccoed structures shall be of stucco to match the existing in color, composition and texture. 
 Any and all additions to concrete block structures shall be of matching concrete block and shall have mortar joints that match the existing. 
 Where brick and other masonry finishes were unpainted, they shall generally remain unpainted. Painting hides detailing and alters the distinguishing original qualities of a building. Under some circumstances, particularly where the brick quality is poor or abrasive cleaning methods have been used, painting brick may be appropriate as a protective measure, if approved by the board. 
 When a brick veneer is applied only to a front façade, it shall return onto both side facades a minimum depth of two feet. 
 Brick shall be laid in true bonding pattern (no stack pattern) or in Flemish bond or like. 
 Brick mortar joints shall be struck or concave or three-sixteenth inch flush only. 
 Trim on brick buildings may be made of pre-cast concrete, terracotta, or stone. 
 Stucco shall be applied consistent with the style of the structure, which is typically smooth sand finish for masonry vernacular buildings and rustic for Spanish Colonial Revival. 
c)  Existing aluminum or vinyl siding or other simulated wall cladding. Any and all additions to structures that are sided with aluminum or vinyl siding or other simulated cladding shall be clad with materials to match the original historic structure in size, profile, shape, color, orientation and texture. 
d)  Facades with a combination of materials. Any and all additions to structures with a combination of cladding materials shall be sided using one or more of the existing cladding materials in a manner that is in character with the style and period of the structure. 
Porches and balconies. 
 Porches and porch features that are in good condition or repairable and are in character with the style and period of the building shall be retained. Porches and porch features shall be repaired so they match the original in materials, size and configuration. 
 Replacement of existing porches with a design or materials not in character with the style and period of the building shall be prohibited. 
 Porch flooring shall be wood, tongue and groove, and must match original porch flooring in size, shape, orientation, and texture. 
 Porch flooring shall be oriented perpendicular to the building's façade, or shall match the original orientation. 
 Replacement porch flooring shall be keyed in so the repair when completed, is not visible.

Screen enclosures shall not hide defining architectural features of the building. The screen enclosure shall not exceed the height of the main structure. 
 New porch elements, such as, by way of example only and not as a limitation, balusters and columns brackets, trim, and architectural embellishments shall be compatible with the style and period of the building and shall be substantiated by physical and/or pictorial evidence of the subject property. 
 Porches visible from the right-of-way shall not be enclosed with materials such as screening, fabric, glass, wood, aluminum, vinyl, fiberglass or masonry. Temporary shade devices must be approved via a certificate of appropriateness and must not be visible from the right of way when retracted. 
 Porches not visible from the right-of-way may be screened. The new materials shall be installed so as not to conceal or damage historical architectural elements. The framing members for screening shall have a design and scale that is in character with the style and period of the building. 
 Porch additions shall have a roof type that is either similar to the existing roof or is in character with the style and period of the building. 
Roofs. 
 The original roof shape and material of the principal and accessory buildings shall be retained if it is in good condition or repairable. 
 Deteriorated roofing material shall be replaced with new material that is consistent with the style of the structure, and shall be similar to the existing or original roof in composition, size, shape and texture, except in the case of asbestos shingles, which may be replaced with new materials, such as fiberglass shingles, cement fiber tiles or shingles, or clay tiles that are similar to the original roofing. All shingles shall be architectural. 
 Roof repairs are allowed only if the new roof matches the existing in material, shape, texture, design, dimension, color, and other identifying features. 
 Architectural features that give the roof its character, such as dormers, cornices, towers, decorative brackets, eaves, chimneys, parapets, and exposed rafter ends shall be retained or replicated and not concealed.

a)  Residential: 
 Fences and garden walls in historic districts generally vary in architectural style. Most fences in the city's historic areas are of the painted wood variety. It is important to maintain the architectural integrity of the property through the design of the fence. 
 Where new fences are introduced, the materials shall be compatible with the original style, texture, or exterior materials of the buildings on the site. 
 Construct new front-yard fences of vertical pickets in simple designs, especially on frame vernacular buildings. Limit cast iron fencing to high-styled buildings such as Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Spanish Colonial Revival. 
 Fence height shall conform to the City Code. 
 A modification, replacement or addition of a fence will require a certificate of appropriateness prior to the commencement of the construction. 
 Garden walls may be of brick or stucco matching the principal building. 
 Brick or stucco garden walls shall be no less than eight inches wide and capped by a flat round or pitched top, overlapping no less than one fourth of an inch the wall below. 
 Fences shall be made with no more than three-inch gaps between pickets. 
 The overall design of walls and fences shall present a quality image consistent with the historic characteristics of the structure or the surrounding area. 
 All walls and fences shall have their finished side facing outward. 
b)  Commercial: 
Screening walls and fences are discouraged in the commercial historic district, except for low street-walls along the lot frontage, as a continuation of the building along street fronts. The street-wall shall be a minimum of three feet and a maximum of five feet in height. Walls greater than three feet in height above grade shall be no more than 50 percent solid. 
Building color/coatings. 
 Paint color selection for buildings within the historic districts shall be appropriate to the predominant architecture of the structure. 
 Colors for properties located within local historic districts may be chosen from the National Trust for Historic Preservation paint colors collection which is filed in the city. An owner may propose a different make of paint to use, but the paint must be proven to be equivalent in every respect with the selected make of paint and the administrative official approves such alteration. At least two colors shall be selected, one for the body of the building and one or more for the accents and trims. Refer to the architectural styles section for paint color choices based on style. 
 It is prohibited and unlawful to use colors without historic basis within historic districts. 
 Brick, stone, or other materials intended to be naturally unpainted shall remain unpainted, unless the material has been painted before. 
 Wood stained surfaces shall continue to be stained and not painted. Other wood surfaces shall be treated and may be painted, or allowed to weather in appearance. 
 Paint shall not be removed from materials which were originally painted. 
 Tile roofs may be painted, however, the color selected shall be similar to the natural color of the original roofing material of the building. 
 The use elastomeric, ceramic, and liquid vinyl membranes coatings for historic wall surfaces is prohibited and unlawful due to the lack of permeability which hastens deterioration. 
Accessory structures and pool enclosures. 
 Prefabricated accessory storage structures shall not exceed 100 square feet in area, and are subject to the setback requirements of the district. 
 There shall be a minimum separation of ten feet between principal and accessory structures. 
 Accessory structures, such as garages, sheds, etc. shall not exceed the height of the main structure. 
 Accessory structures shall be of similar style, color, design and materials as used for the principal residence (see Section 8.0.C.4. for acceptable materials). 
 Air conditioning, mechanical equipment and other support equipment shall not be placed in a setback and must be screened from view. 
 Mechanical cabinets may be placed in an area not visible from the right-of-way and the wall surface must be horizontal lap siding or match that of the primary building. 
 Temporary or portable structures installed on a site in the historic districts including, but not limited to, temporary storage units and aluminum frame car ports, shall obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to the installation of the unit even if no building permit is required. 
 Satellite antennas. The city has devoted significant public resources to protect its historic district and the historic structures located within the historic district from the encroachment of structures and development that detract from the historic ambience of the historic district. The city has also devoted its comprehensive planning, growth management, and land development regulatory efforts to ensuring that the historic district is protected from harmful modernistic structures, styles and patterns that are incongruent with the requirements relating to the historic district and which would harm the public's ability to relish past times and to further the protection of sites and locales of historical significance that are disappearing from our cultural landscape. In order to further those goals, a single satellite antenna may be permitted on lots and parcels located in the historic district only if the proposed satellite antenna is located on an area of the lot or parcel that is not visible from the public right-of-way (including, but not limited to all abutting sidewalks) and park areas. In the event that this prohibition is believed by a property owner to constitute a material and significant hardship, the property owner may file an application for a variance in accordance with the provisions, processes and procedures of this code which application, shall, initially, but subsequent to city staff review and analysis, be reviewed by the historic preservation board which shall provide a recommendation relative to the variance application which shall be considered during the course of the reviews and considerations pertaining to the application. 
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 10.0. - Relocation of landmarks. 
    Buildings shall be preserved in their original location on the site where constructed. The relocation of a building can disrupt not only the historic character of the building but the immediate area as well. Relocation is prohibited and unlawful, unless a development order is entered finding that the building is threatened in its original location or renovation and continued use is prohibited by its current location. Relocating a building is a last resort to avoid demolition. Relocated buildings shall be situated on the site in the same orientation as the original location. 
    The relocation of landmarks and contributing buildings require the approval of a certificate of appropriateness by the board. When reviewing such applications, the board shall consider the following criteria: 
1.  Whether the historic character and aesthetic interest of the building, structure, or object contributes to its present setting; 
2.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area; 
3.  Whether the building, structure, or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and 
4.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure or object. 
    Applications for relocation shall be submitted at least ten business days prior to the board meeting, and the site of the subject structure shall be posted for at least ten consecutive days prior to the board meeting. 
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 11.0. - Ordinary maintenance. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish minimum standards for the maintenance of historic landmarks and properties within established historic districts. 
A.  Required maintenance. The owner of a structure within a historic district or of a designated landmark shall not permit such structure or landmark to fall into a state of disrepair which may result in the deterioration of any exterior appurtenance or architectural feature so as to produce or to tend to produce, in the judgment of the board, a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole or the life and character of the landmark or structure in question, including but not limited to: 
1.  The deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports; 
2.  The deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members; 
3.  The deterioration of exterior chimneys; 
4.  The deterioration or crumbling of exterior plaster or mortar; 
5.  The ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and foundations, including broken windows or doors; 
6.  The deterioration of any feature so as to create or permit the creation of any hazardous or unsafe condition(s); 
7.  The deterioration of any architectural feature which contributes to the architectural or historic significance and/or integrity of the structure; 
8.  The deterioration of exterior appurtenances. 
Nothing in this schedule shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior feature in an historic district or of any landmark which does not involve a change in design, material, color, or other appearance thereof. 
Nothing in this schedule shall prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition of any such feature which the building inspector or similar official shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. 
B.  Standards for building maintenance. 
 The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means practicable. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that could damage the historic building materials such as the use of any abrasive, corrosive, or damaging techniques which include blasting with pulverized materials, glass beads or other solids, with or without water is prohibited and unlawful. 
 Abrasive cleaning or paint removal is another threat to historic wooden siding. The proper method for removing paint is cleaning, light scraping and sanding down to the next sound layer. If more intensive paint removal is required, the gentlest means practicable shall be used. Harsh abrasive methods such as rotary sanding discs, rotary wires strippers, and sandblasting shall not be used to remove paint from exterior wood. Such methods leave visible circular depressions in the wood; shred the wood, or erode the soft, porous fibers of the wood, leaving a permanently pitted surface. 
 Paint removal is permitted, but must not leave behind any evidence of methods used. This includes wood damage, gouging or grinding marks left by mechanical tools, burns left by chemicals or burns left by heat sources. Additionally paint removal processes that put the structure as a whole or in part in danger are forbidden including torches and heat guns. Debris from paint removal shall be collected and disposed of in accordance with federal guidelines. 
 Clean wood using the gentlest means possible. Repair trim and siding before applying paint. Seal holes, caulk cracks, and treat for wood fungus. Remove loose paint using commercial strippers, electric heat guns or plates, wire brushes and scrapers. Hand sand to reduce paint layer differential. 
 While masonry is the most durable historic building material, the cleaning of historic masonry is a special consideration because it is susceptible to damage by improper maintenance or repair techniques and abrasive cleaning methods. Sandblasting and other abrasive cleaning methods are not permitted. Sandblasting changes the visual qualities of brick damages and destroys the exterior glazing. As a result, rapid deterioration of the brick and potential water damage to the interior of the building are possibilities. 
 Masonry shall be cleaned only when necessary to halt deterioration or remove heavy soiling. 
 Clean masonry surfaces with the gentlest method possible, such as water and detergents and bristle brushes. 
 Sandblasting of brick or stone surfaces using dry or wet grit or other abrasives is prohibited. Such methods of cleaning permanently erode the surface of the material and accelerate deterioration. 
 Remove damaged or deteriorated paint only to the next sound layer using hand scraping prior to repainting. 
 Paint historically unpainted masonry only if it has been previously painted or as a protective measure to prevent further deterioration caused by poor quality materials prior to abrasive cleaning. 
 Treat mortar joint deterioration from leaking roofs or gutters and differential settlement of the building. 
 Evaluate the overall condition of the masonry to determine whether repairs rather than protection and maintenance are required. 
 Protect leaking roof with plywood and building paper until it can be properly repaired. 
 Protect and maintain masonry by providing proper drainage so that water does not stand on flat, horizontal surfaces or accumulate in curved decorative features. 
C.  "Mothballing" structures. 
1.  Definition. Mothballing is the temporary closing of a structure to protect it from weather and secure it from vandalism. Mothballing may include the covering of doors, windows or other openings in a structure by any type of material. Excluded from this definition are: 
 Typical hurricane or storm shutters custom manufactured and permanently installed on residences on a year round basis and then closed during the owner's temporary absence. 
 The temporary (four-to-five day) boarding up normally done in preparation for a severe storm. 
2.  Applicability. Boarding-up of structure shall be allowed, upon approval of a certificate of appropriateness by the board, in order to provide temporary protection and stabilization of vacant historic buildings. No windows, doors or other openings may be boarded-up in inhabited buildings. 
3.  Mothballing program. Together with a certificate of appropriateness application, a mothballing program shall be submitted to the board. The program shall include: 
 Documentation on the architectural and historical significance of the building; 
 A professional assessment of the condition of the building; 
 Methods of stabilization, pest control and ventilation that will be used prior to mothballing; 
 Methods of securing the building from vandals, break-ins and natural disasters; 
 Plan for periodic maintenance and surveillance monitoring; 
All mothballing programs shall be consistent with Preservation Brief 31, Mothballing Historic Buildings, Technical Preservation Series, National Parks Service. 
4.  Paint required. Any person who boards up, or causes to be boarded up, any structure shall paint or cause to be painted the material used to board up the structure the same color as the building. 
5.  Maintenance of boarded-up premises. The premises of all mothballed structures shall be maintained in accordance with the City Code. 
D.  Checklist. The code enforcement staff shall use a checklist when inspecting historic landmarks or properties within designated historic districts. The list covers areas such as: 
 Exterior of property (sanitation, grading/drainage, walkways and driveways, weeds, and accessory structures). 
 Exterior of structure (street numbers, exterior appearance, foundation walls, windows and doors, roofs, drainage, chimneys, and porches/decks). 
E.  City action to prevent deterioration. Whenever the code enforcement staff determines that there has been a violation of any provisions of this schedule, he/she shall: 
1.  Provide the occupant of the property with a notice, delivered in person, advising of future city actions. If there is not an attempt to correct the violation within ten days, a copy of the warning shall also be mailed to the property owner. 
2.  If, after the ten days noted above, there has been no attempt to correct the violation, code enforcement staff shall give another written notice of violation to the person(s) responsible for the correction. Such notice shall include a schedule for completion of the required improvements necessary to bring the building into compliance with the City Code. The time given shall not exceed 45 days for both major and minor violations. 
3.  Any violation not corrected in the time and manner specified in the notice may be referred to the code enforcement special magistrate. 
F.  When a certificate of appropriateness is issued in response to a code enforcement notice or citation, application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made within ten business days of the notice or citation and the violation shall be remedied within 45 days from the date of issuance of the certificate of appropriateness unless the historic preservation board or the administrative official grants a longer period of time upon a finding that unusual circumstances prevent the remedy from occurring in a timely manner. 
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 12.0. - Demolition. 
A.  Criteria for reviewing demolition permits. No landmark or structure within a local historic district shall be demolished or removed, in whole or in part, until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been approved by the board based on the following criteria: 
1.  The historic, architectural or environmental significance of the structure. 
2.  The historic, architectural or environmental significance of the structure to the overall ensemble of structures within the district and the importance of the structure to the integrity of the district. 
3.  The aesthetic interest that the structure adds to the district, or in the case of an historic landmark, to the city. 
4.  The number of remaining examples of similar significance in the district or, in the case of an historic landmark, in the city. 
5.  The difficulty or impossibility of reproducing such a structure because of its design, texture, material, detail, size, scale or uniqueness of location. 
6.  The plans for future utilization of the site and the effect those plans will have on the architectural, historical, archaeological, social, aesthetic or environmental character of the district. 
7.  The reasonable measures that can be taken to save the structure from further deterioration, collapse, arson, vandalism or neglect. 
8.  Any measures that have been taken to prevent the structure from deteriorating, such as performance of normal maintenance and repairs and provision of normal tenant improvements. In addition, whether the structure was willfully or negligently allowed to deteriorate. Properties cited for demolition by neglect that are not repaired may not be granted a demolition permit. 
9.  The determination by the building official that the structure is an imminent hazard to public safety and that repair would be impractical. 
10.  The economic hardship imposed on the owner if the application for certificate of appropriateness for demolition is denied. 
11.  The submittal of a detailed report describing all aspects of the structure's historical and architectural characteristics from the city's historic resources inventory and Florida Master Site File This report shall be prepared by a qualified person knowledgeable in historic preservation under contract with the city at the applicant's expense. 
12.  The submittal of a detailed report describing all aspects of the structure's physical condition prepared by an architect, licensed design professional or registered civil engineer at the applicant's expense. 
B.  Procedures for issuing demolition certificate of appropriateness. No landmark or structure within a local historic district shall be issued a demolition permit for removal in whole or in part, until after the following procedures are complete: 
1.  The demolition permit must accompany a building permit for a replacement structure which meets all regulations and has received all required approvals. 
2.  This demolition permit may only be issued after the waiting period has been completed. 
3.  Upon approval of the demolition request and prior to issuance of a building permit (time defined as the waiting period), the property owner and contractor shall sign an affidavit to the city that they are aware of the city's definition of a demolition and the penalties associated with an unlawful demolition. 
4.  If demolition occurred without the issuance of a demolition permit, the building permit filed for the replacement structure shall have an additional assessment of the demolition permit fee that was not collected, in addition to the after the fact fee. 
5.  In all cases, no changes to the previously approved plans may be made except as determined by the administrative official in consultation with the board to meet current zoning and building code requirements. 
6.  When demolition of a structure is allowed, the city shall provide the developer of the structure to be demolished with information about the salvaging of building materials. At least ten days prior to the date when the demolition is scheduled to commence, the developer shall provide the planning director with written notice, and an advertisement published in a newspaper of general circulation at the applicant's expense, of the availability of materials for salvage, including the name and telephone number of a contact person. Upon request, the planning director may make this information available to persons who may be interested in contacting the owner(s) to arrange for possible salvage of building materials. No salvaging of materials shall occur until a demolition permit has been approved by the building department. 
7.  Submittal of documentation requirements in accordance with Appendix B, Documentation Requirements for Buildings Proposed for Demolition and Standards for Architectural Documentation. 
C.  Waiting period. If a certificate of appropriateness is issued by the board for demolition, the certificate of appropriateness must include the condition that the applicant must wait for a total period of 180 days before the applicant may perform such demolition or relocation in accordance with this schedule. 
During this period, the board may negotiate with the owner of the landmark and with any other party to find a means of preserving the property including the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise of the property or any interest therein. 
1.  Extension of waiting period. The 180-day waiting period may be extended for up to an additional 180 days by the city commission upon a recommendation from the board that: 
 There is a program or project in progress which may result in acquisition of the property for the purpose of its preservation and/or restoration; and 
 There is a reasonable ground to believe that the program or project will be successful. 
2.  Reduction/waiver in waiting period. The board may reduce or waive the waiting period required by this section in any case where the owner would suffer extreme hardship, not including loss of profit, unless a reduction in the required period were allowed. The board shall also have the discretionary authority to waive all or any portion of the required waiting period provided that the alteration, remodeling, relocation or change of use is undertaken subject to conditions agreed to by the board insuring the continued maintenance of the historical, architectural, or cultural integrity and character of the property. 
D.  Economic hardship. Economic hardship shall be determined in accordance with this section. When a claim of extreme economic hardship is presented, proof shall be submitted that the applicant cannot realize a reasonable and beneficial use of or economic return from the property. If the property is residential and non-income producing or is an accessory structure, the owner shall not be required to prove economic hardship. In the case of a partial demolition of a structure where the principal facades remain intact, the owner shall not be required to prove economic hardship. The board shall make findings based on each of the following factors provided by the applicant: 
1.  Whether the applicant knew or should have known of the historic landmark or district designation at the time of acquisition and whether the structure or district was designated subsequent to acquisition.

Therefore, RVs and boats may be parked in front of residential structures for not more than two days per calendar week. 
(Ord. No. 4337, § 2, 3-23-2015) 
Section 15.0. - The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). 
    The ADA extends comprehensive civil rights to individuals with disabilities. The city has a commitment to adherence to and compliance with the ADA. Historic properties, including buildings, sites and landscapes, are not exempt from the ADA and must comply with its regulations. Historic properties often can be made accessible while preserving their architectural character through careful planning and sensitive design. A three-step approach is recommended to identify and implement accessibility modifications that will protect the integrity and historic character of historic properties: 
1.  Review the historical significance of the property and identify character-defining features. Thoroughly inspect and evaluate the character defining features, materials and spaces of a property before upgrading it for handicap accessibility. Significant materials, the form and style of the property, the principal elevations, major architectural and landscape features and the principal public spaces shall be the items identified for preservation. 
2.  Assess the property's existing and required level of accessibility. While inspecting a property, features, materials, and spaces of less significance to the historic character of the property shall also be identified. Non-significant spaces, secondary pathways, additions, previous altered areas, utilitarian spaces, and service areas can usually be modified without threatening or destroying a property's historical significance. 
3.  Evaluate accessibility options within a preservation context. Modifications for handicap accessibility shall be compatible with the property. They shall be in scale with the property, visually compatible in terms of their design and materials, but be differentiated from the original. They shall be reversible so that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the property would be unimpaired. 
Congress recognized the national interest in preserving historic properties when it enacted the ADA. Congress established alternative minimum requirements for qualified historic properties that cannot physically be made accessible without threatening or destroying their significance. 
Modifications for handicap accessibility shall be compatible with the property and reversible. They shall be in scale with the property, visually compatible in terms of their design and materials, but be differentiated from the original. They shall be reversible so that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the property would be unimpaired. 
Properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and those designated under state or local law are qualified historic properties. Owners of qualified historic properties must first consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) before using the alternative minimum requirements. If the SHPO determines that compliance with the full accessibility requirements would threaten or destroy the significance of a building or facility, the following alternative minimum requirements may be used: 
 One accessible route must be provided from a site access point to an accessible entrance. Using a ramp with a one to six (1:6) slope is permissible for a run of up to two feet. 
 One accessible entrance must be provided. If it is not possible to make the public entrance accessible, then an alternative, unlocked entrance is acceptable. Directional signage at the primary entrance and a notification system at the accessible entrance must be provided. 
 If toilets are provided, only one must be accessible, and it may be unisex. 
 Public spaces on the level of the accessible entrance must be accessible, and other public levels shall be accessible whenever practicable. 
 Displays and written information shall be located where a seated person can see them. Horizontal signage shall be no higher then 44 inches above the floor. 
In limited circumstances, if it is determined in consultation with the SHPO that compliance with the alternative minimum requirements would also threaten or destroy the significance of a historic building, alternative methods of access may be used. The alternative methods of accessibility that may be used to make a buildings program and activities accessible include: 
 Using audio-visual materials and devices to show inaccessible areas of a historic property. 
 Assigning persons to guide individuals with disabilities into or through inaccessible areas of a historic property. 
 Adopting other innovative methods.

 Simple doors, often with panes of glass. 


7.  Color. 
 Houses with different siding materials often received two different paint colors. These houses usually have natural colors such as earth-browns, moss greens, sand yellows, and terra cotta reds. The body of the house is often unpainted with stained shingles in brown or red. These colors were less saturated and earthier than Victorian-era colors. 
 While trim colors were used to bring out architectural details, they were chosen to complement the overall color scheme rather than to emphasize specific architectural elements. Trim colors were often white, light yellow, gray and light green. Doors were left unpainted and were varnished. 
8.  Exterior decoration. 
 Great degree of ornamentation, but the ornament was used to emphasize the structure and construction of the building rather than to adorn for the sake of adornment. 
 Carved rafter ends. 
 Decorative gable end trim. 
 Window surrounds. 
 Column base and capitals. 
9.  Local examples.

 Porch is intended to accentuate the characteristic asymmetrical façade. 
 Main entrance always included in the porch area. 
 Simple, classical columns sometimes grouped and raised to the railing level with pedestals. 
 Simple railings; occasionally, turned spindles.

 Polygonal towers typically placed at one corner of the front façade, with a conical roof. 
 Multiple dormers and gables. 
 Metal or composition shingles. 
 Brick chimneys with decorative patterns or coursing, decorated chimney caps.

8.  Color. 
 Rich, intense and fairly strong, and contrasting colors were used to bring out different architectural elements. Deep browns, saturated olives, yellow ochres and rich brick reds were color choices for the Victorian era. 
 The body of the building often would be medium gray, dark red, dark blue, dark green or brown. While not brilliant, these colors were highly saturated and created a sumptuous, rich palette. 
 Architectural elements such as window sashes, trim and carved ornaments are painted in contrasting colors - either darker or lighter - to draw attention to them. These colors for trim were often dark gray, dark brown, olive green, or dark red. 
 Because the roof is often very visible in Victorian buildings, shingle colors and patterns shall likewise be taken into consideration in selecting a palette. 
 Doors were usually left unpainted, or were varnished or grained.

APPENDIX B 
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDINGS PROPOSED FOR DEMOLITION AND STANDARDS FOR ARCHITECTURAL DOCUMENTATION PURPOSE 
These standards concern the development of documentation for historic buildings and structures which are proposed for demolition due to deterioration or the acquisition of a site for new purposes. This documentation, which usually consists of dimensioned drawings, photographs and written data, provides important information on a property's significance for use by scholars, researchers, historians, architects and others interested in preserving and understanding our past. 
TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION 
There are four levels of documentation available for use in recording historic buildings a determined by the Historic American Building Survey (HABS). For most purposes, Level III will be acceptable. This determination will be made, however, on a case by case basis by the Bureau of Historic Preservation prior to any actual demolition activity; that is, at the time of the request for demolition. For those structures not falling within the purview of the Bureau, the reader is encouraged to use that level of documentation best suited to the structure under consideration. 
Level I measured drawings usual depict existing conditions through the use of a site plan, floor, plans, elevations sections and construction details. 
Level II documentation differs from Level I by substituting copies of existing drawings (either original or alteration drawings) for recently executed measured drawings. While existing drawings are rarely as suitable as as-built drawings, they are adequate in many cases for documentation purposes. 
Level III documentation requires a sketch plan if it helps to explain the structure. The architectural data form (see Attachment A) should supplement the photographs by explaining what is not readily visible. 
Level IV documentation consists of a HABS inventory card and photograph only. 
GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE STANDARDS DEFINITIONS 
Architectural Data Form. See Attachment A. 
Documentation. Documentation consists of measured drawings, photographs, histories, inventory cards or other media that depicts historic buildings, sites, structures or objects. 
Field Photography. Photography other than large format intended for the purpose of documentation: usually 35 mm. 
Field Record. Notes of measurements taken, field photographs and other recorded information intended for the purpose of producing documentation. 
Inventory Card. A one page narrative which includes written data, a sketched site plan and a 35 mm contact print dry-mounted on the page; the negative, with a separate contact sheet and index shall be included with the Inventory Card. 
Large Format Photographs. Photographs taken of historic buildings, sites, structures or objects where the negative is 4" × 5", 5" × 7" or 8" × 10" in size and where the photograph is taken with appropriate means to correct perspective distortion. 
Measured Drawings. Drawings produced on HABS or Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) formats, depicting existing conditions or other relevant features of historic buildings, sites, structures or objects. Measured drawings are usually produced in ink on archivally stable material, such as mylar.

For those parcels located in the historic commercial district, the provisions of Schedule S shall prevail, unless otherwise noted in this schedule. 
Developments within the downtown overlay district, the riverfront overlay district and the midtown overlay district may be approved through the planned development process. The design of planned developments shall adhere to traditional design development and shall generally conform to the downtown/riverfront overlay standards for block development, site design, lot layout, prototype design, and building design. Any deviation from the standards of this ordinance shall result in a development that is beneficial to the city, enhances the character of the community in which it is located and is superior to a project that is designed consistent with the downtown/riverfront overlay standards. 
The maximum height of structures on Marina Isle is 90 feet as measured from sidewalk grade to the rooftop including attics, mechanical equipment and raised basements. Decorative elements may exceed the total height of the structure by no more than ten percent of the total height of the building for structures greater than four stories and by no more than 20 percent for structures four stories and less. 
C.  District intent statements. The following three overlay districts are based on the key principles of urban type development, which are walkable and designed to contain a diverse range of housing, shopping and offices. All three districts will offer design standards for development that provide for an efficient land use form and cost-effective delivery of urban services. 
1.  Riverfront Overlay District (RF). The purpose of this district is to provide for a mixed-use area for high-density residential, offices and retail uses. 
2.  Midtown Overlay District (MT). The primary purpose of this district is to encourage residential uses. This district provides for a mixed-use area for single-family, multifamily housing, offices and neighborhood serving retail, where appropriate, and is not in direct conflict with the residential usage. 
3.  Downtown Overlay District (DT). The primary purpose of this district is to encourage commercial uses. This district provides for a mixed-use area for single-family, multifamily housing, hotel, offices and retail, where appropriate, and is not in direct conflict with the residential usage and the historic district. 
D.  Designation of street type. The downtown/riverfront standards designate three street types that exist within the downtown/riverfront area. The identification of each street type directly relates to the site design and lot layout criteria outlined in these standards. 
1.  Designation of "A" streets, "B" streets and "pedestrian priority" streets: 
a.  The following table designates existing streets within the downtown/riverfront area as an "A" street or a "pedestrian priority" street. Streets not specifically designated will be considered "B" streets. The creation of new streets constructed on or after the effective date of this ordinance will be updated and designated by the city. 
b.  "A" streets shall have building frontage requirements, established build-to lines and active retail on first floor, restricted parking and service uses adjacent to an "A" street. 
c.  "Pedestrian priority" streets shall have building frontage requirements, established build to lines, restrict parking and service uses adjacent to a "pedestrian priority" street. 
d.  "B" streets shall have no building frontage requirements. While "B" streets are not intended to be primary pedestrian streets, additional provisions on architectural details, accessory structures, and service bays will be provided. All streets west of French Avenue are "B" streets.

E.  Permitted development types. In order to reinforce the Downtown/Riverfront Area, new development shall be organized into development blocks. 
Development activity shall be regulated through these standards and shall be required to comply with the comprehensive definition of permitted development included herein that regulates use, density, intensity, and form by requiring development to occur within one of the following development block types: 
1.  Single-use commercial development. 
2.  Mixed-use development: 
a.  Office/neighborhood commercial. 
b.  Retail development. 
c.  High density development. 
3.  Attached and detached residential development. 
4.  Transitional mid-block residential development. 
5.  Infill development. 
The block types shall be used for illustrative purposes. Development applications for specific sites are required to assemble structures into mixed-use blocks or half-blocks, as appropriate, for the site. Each site plan shall be required to identify how the proposed development, including buildings and structures, are assembled within a context that conforms to the design standards for the block or half-block within which the building occurs. 
The development block structure reinforces the Downtown/Riverfront's existing block structure and street network by limiting block size and framing the development block within the existing street system. This block structure is designed to create a walkable community through a set of block standards and requirements for site design, lot layout and building design. The following table identifies each block type and denotes a "P" for permitted and "NP" for not permitted.

F.  Site design and lot layout. Examples of permitted development types are described for illustrative purposes. Each site plan shall be required to identify how the proposed development, including buildings and structures, is assembled within a context that conforms to the design standards for the block or partial block within which the building occurs. 
The development examples are a series of illustrations that highlight some of the downtown/riverfront standards. The illustrations are shown in a block format and individual parcel development may not be able to build to the form of a block. However, all development, at a minimum, will be expected to comply with the building design, site design and lot layout as described in these design standards. If development of an entire block occurs, the illustration shall be used as a development tool. Any new development that is at least two acres in size shall follow the block structure. The maximum permitted block size for new development shall not exceed 350 feet by 600 feet. The Administrative Official or his designee may permit a varying block size provided site constraints exist and the maximum block size must be maintained by pedestrian access and breaks on the first floor. 
1.  Single-use commercial development. The single-use commercial illustration, figure A, permits a wide range of commercial uses. 
a.  Height. One to four stories not to exceed 56 feet. 
b.  Setbacks. The minimum front setback is zero feet and the maximum setback is 15 feet. Side setbacks shall be the same as the front setbacks. 
c.  Setback encroachment. Special architectural features, such as balconies, bay windows, arcades, awnings, etc. may project into front setbacks and public rights-of-way on streets provided they are eight feet above the sidewalk and leave a minimum five-foot wide unobstructed sidewalk.

H.  Building mass. Black facades are prohibited. Buildings shall provide storefront windows, doors, entries, transoms, awnings, cornice treatment and other architectural features to add visual interest. 
1.  Building mass shall be divided into smaller components, including a base, middle, and top as a means of maintaining a pedestrian scale. See figure 7, example of buildings that are designed and constructed so that they have a distinct base, middle and top. 

a.  The base of a building should be defined by appropriately contrasting material or color such as decorative banding (veneers, changes in colors, materials, and texture), low planters and or foundation plantings. 
b.  The middle of buildings shall be distinguished through the use of arcades, colonnades, awnings, trellis', or other building elements that provide a change in wall planes and creates shadows. 
c.  The top of buildings shall be defined by distinct roof forms, pronounced eaves, parapet design, and/or cornices. 
I.  Variation in massing . To avoid a single, large, dominant building and the insubstantial appearance of false front and parapets, all facades, excluding courtyard areas, shall be designed to employ, at a minimum, the following design treatments. See figure 8, the mass and scale of large, box-like buildings should be reduced by articulating the facades (especially those that face the street) with vertical and horizontal wall projections. Articulating the building reduces monotony and creates visual interest. 

1.  Projections and recesses to reduce the perception of building bulk and scale and to ensure a street frontage that rewards pedestrian interest. See figure 9, façade projection/recesses examples. 

a.  For buildings 40,000 square feet or larger in gross building area, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any façade, at any point must be 150 linear feet. Projections and recesses must have a minimum depth of ten feet with 150 linear feet limitation. 
b.  For buildings between 20,000 and 39,999 square feet in gross building area, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any façade, at any point must be 125 linear feet. Projections and recesses must have a minimum depth of eight feet within 125 linear feet limitation. 
c.  For buildings between 10,000 and 19,999 square feet in gross building area, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any façade, at any point must be 100 linear feet. Projections and recesses must have a minimum depth of six feet within 100 linear feet limitation. 
d.  For buildings between 5,000 and 9,999 square feet in gross building area, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any façade, at any point must be 75 linear feet. Projections and recesses must have a minimum depth of four feet within 75 linear feet limitation. 
e.  For buildings less than 5,000 square feet in gross building area, maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any façade, at any point, must be 50 linear feet. Projections and recesses must have a minimum depth of three feet, and a minimum total width of 20 percent of the façade length. 
f.  If a building has a projection or recess of 40 feet or more, each is considered a separate façade, and must meet the above requirements for wall plane changes. 
J.  Façade Articulation. Facades shall be designed with sufficient vertical and horizontal articulation to add visual interest and break up the visual mass of the structure. Appropriate forms of articulation include the use of windows; changes in material, texture, color or detail; a change in a wall plane location direction; and variations with the roofline. See figure 10, for example of façade articulation that has variety and no repetitious use of façade elements and is not plain caused by lack of articulation. 

1.  Breaks (reveals, recesses) in the surface of the wall itself; 
2.  A column or pier at least one foot wide and eight inches deep; 
3.  Placement for window and door openings; and 
4.  The placement of balconies, awning and canopies. 
5.  The design of architectural facades and roof planes shall not be a physical background for signage. 
K.  Roofs. Roofs are an integral part of building design and shall be designed and constructed to add interest to and reduce the massing of buildings. Roof features shall be in scale with the buildings mass and complement the character of adjoining structures, developments and neighborhoods. Roofs shall be constructed of durable, high quality materials in order to enhance the appearance and attractiveness of the community. Roofs shall incorporate the design elements and materials listed herein: 
1.  Vary roof forms, heights and materials to assist in breaking up the mass of long, linear buildings. 
2.  Sloped roofs shall provide articulation and variations in order to break up the massiveness of the roof. Sloped roofs shall include eaves, which are a minimum of two feet in width. 
3.  Flat roofs shall be screened with parapets on all sides of the building. If no roof top equipment exists or is proposed, the parapet shall be a minimum of two feet in height. 
4.  All parapets shall feature cornice treatments. Parapets shall include a cap element to define the upper edge of the building. 
5.  With the exception of non-visible flat roofs, roof materials shall consist of concrete, clay, slate or terra cotta tiles, standing seam metal, metal shingles or asphalt shingles (laminated, 25-year architectural grade or better) or similar materials. 
6.  False mansard roofs are prohibited. Mansard roofs are not permitted as the predominant roof design. They may be used on a limited basis to add interest and variety consistent with sound and generally accepted architectural practices and principles and shall require a variance in order to be used. If permitted to be used, mansard roofs shall wrap around the entire perimeter of the structure. 
7.  Long, unbroken, monotonous, horizontal rooflines are prohibited. No roofline ridge or parapet shall run unbroken for more than 75 feet. Vertical or horizontal articulation is required. 
8.  Roof overhangs or other details that create usable shade on sidewalk areas are desirable. Clipped rooflines, which do not extend outward from the exterior wall, are prohibited. 
9.  Vegetated "green" or cool roof designs are encouraged. 


10.  Roof mounted mechanical units shall be located or screened so as not to be visible from adjacent public and private streets or properties. See figure 11, 12, and 13 for example of types of screening for roof top mounted equipment. Roof mounted mechanical screening shall be accomplished by: 
a.  Raising the parapet on all sides of the building to screen the highest mechanical unit or vent on the roof. 
b.  A secondary roof screening system designed to be as high as the highest mechanical unit or vent. Secondary roof screening systems shall be of complimentary materials and shall appear as an integrated component of the building. 
11.  Primary colors, high-intensity colors, metallic or fluorescent colors shall not be used as predominant roof colors and are prohibited. 
L.  Awnings and canopies. 
1.  The use of awnings or canopies over sidewalks is encouraged. See figures 14, 15, 16 and 17 for examples of awnings/canopies that complement a façade's design and color scheme and reinforce a building's character. 




2.  Awnings or canopies shall project a maximum of four feet from the building when located over pedestrian areas and no less than two feet otherwise. 
3.  Awnings or canopies shall maintain a minimum clearance of eight feet above any sidewalk or pedestrian route. 
4.  Awnings shall be flat or sloping. Awnings shall be made of metal, wood, canvas or similar materials. Round bubble or plastic awnings are prohibited. Fully glazed awnings are not permitted. 
5.  Awnings shall fit within the window bays (either above the main glass or the transom light) so as not to obscure or distract from significant architectural features. 
6.  The color of the awning shall be compatible with its attached building. 
7.  Awnings shall not be internally illuminated 
8.  Where feasible, awnings shall be placed at the same height as those on adjacent buildings in order to maintain a consistent horizontal rhythm along the street front. 
The design of canopies over gas pumps shall be integrated with the overall architectural design of the gas station. See figures 18 and 19 for examples of gas canopy structures that relate to the main component of the building with respect to materials, massing and overall design. 


a.  Gas island canopies shall be built of the same quality materials and architecture as the store associated with the gas island. 
b.  Gas island canopy structural columns shall be faced with the same architectural materials as the associated building. 
c.  Any graphics on canopies shall be considered signage and shall follow the City of Sanford land development regulations for signage. 
d.  Lighting luminaries mounted under the canopy structures shall be shielded such that the lamp source is not visible and glare is not created. 
e.  Neon and illuminated panels are prohibited on a canopy. 
M.  Exterior materials and colors. The purpose and intent of building material and color regulations are to maintain and enhance an attractive physical environment within the city, to enhance and sustain property values and to maximize the positive impact of development. 
1.  These requirements shall apply to the exterior of all non-residential buildings and structures. 
a.  All new buildings, structures or additions shall comply with these standards. 

b.  All buildings shall be faced with materials that exhibit a durable, high quality appearance. 
c.  Materials shall be of a low-maintenance type retaining a consistent and clean appearance. 
2.  The color of a storefront and/or building helps to establish a mood or feeling about the business. It also reinforces both the individuality of the building and its relationship to its block, area and city. 
a.  The original color and texture of stone and brick masonry surfaces shall be retained and not painted or altered without administrative approval. 
b.  The use of black or fluorescent colors, or pure primary and secondary colors, is prohibited as the predominant exterior building color(s). See figure 20. 
c.  Building trim and accent area may feature any color(s) limited to ten percent of the affected façade segment, with a maximum trim height of 24 inches. 
3.  Building materials are classified based on their application as follows: 
a.  All facades and businesses within a development shall utilize a consistent palette of materials, textures and colors. 
b.  High quality and long lasting materials that offer texture and avoid monotonous surfaces are strongly encouraged in order to meet the intent of this schedule. The look and dimension of material elements shall relate to human scale. Earth tone building materials that have a pleasing visual texture, such as brick and stone, are required. 
c.  The type and detailing of building materials shall be consistent on all sides of a structure. Materials used on primary facades, if not used for the entire building, shall return along secondary sides at a minimum of 100 feet or 20 percent whichever is less to maintain visual consistency. 
d.  The following is a general guide to the acceptable use of exterior building materials. Use of alternate materials or the extent of material usage may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration such factors as context and architectural style and the intent of this schedule. See figure 21 for examples of buildings materials that are durable and able to withstand long-term exposure to sun and rain. Additional guidelines related to specific materials are provided below: 

i.  Brick and stone-Brick and stone convey permanence and are preferred primary and accent building materials for all building types. 
ii.  Cast-in-place concrete-Cast in place concrete may be appropriate for industrial buildings or secondary facades if sufficient articulation and detail is provided to diminish the appearance of a large, blank wall and provide a high quality architectural finish. Cast-in-place concrete is acceptable as an accent material; provided, however, that its appropriateness for primary material applications will be reviewed within the context of the design intent and surrounding character of development. 
iii.  Pre-cast concrete-Pre-cast concrete is acknowledged as a durable and quality material. Pre-cast concrete panels should incorporate architectural finishes that comply with the architectural articulation and detailing design guidelines as well as the intent of this schedule. The appearance of panel joints should be minimized. On building faces adjacent to a public right-of-way or pedestrian area where the appearance of masonry is to be conveyed, masonry inlays are generally preferred to be coated or painted form liner application which simulate the look of brick or stone; however, the appropriateness of either will be reviewed based upon the context of the design intent and the surrounding character of development. Buildings that utilize tilt up concrete wall panels shall incorporate articulation and color to add a variety of texture and visual interest. 
iv.  Architectural metal cladding-Smooth metal panels with sufficient metal thickness to prevent "oil canning" or deterioration of the surface and promote durability are acceptable. The use of metal should account for the design intent of the building and surrounding character of development. 
v.  Concrete masonry units-Concrete masonry unit (CMU) is acceptable as an accent. Split face CMU may be used as a base material in lieu of limestone. 
vi.  Wood-Wood may be appropriate in specific historical or cultural context. 
vii.  Fiber cement-The use of fiber cement materials shall be limited to accent applications only. 
viii.  Stucco-The use of stucco is acceptable for exterior architectural accents. 
ix.  EIFS-Exterior insulation and finishing system (EIFS) or Dryvit material shall not to be used as a primary material and should only be limited to accent applications above the pedestrian level (approximately ten (10) feet above ground). If used at grade or below, it shall be factory reinforced. 
x.  Siding-Horizontal aluminum, vinyl and residential lap sidings should not be utilized for non-residential applications. 
xi.  Other-Contemporary or specialized building materials not addressed herein will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and will be evaluated based upon such factors as durability, quality, maintenance, architectural intent, aesthetic qualities, characteristics, compatibility with the provisions of these design guidelines, and environmental context. 
N.  Service and utility areas. Buildings require mechanical equipment and service areas that are normally unsightly and sometimes noisy. Utilities can be a visually dominant element in the landscape. These areas include, but are not limited to loading docks, exterior storage areas, dumpsters, and mechanical equipment such as plumbing vent stacks, HVAC transformers, fans and cooling towers. Visible utility infrastructure should be treated to as to lessen the negative visual impacts. The following address the treatment of service and utility areas to reduce the negative visual impact of such areas. See figures 22 and 23 for examples of screening utility areas, mechanical equipment and dumpster enclosure to be architecturally compatible with the building in terms of style, colors, construction materials and finish. 


1.  Locate all service and utility areas away from the street and concealed from building entrances, pedestrian areas, and adjacent residential structures. 
2.  Provide adequate spaces for the intended use of service areas with necessary access and egress. 
3.  When appropriate, consider joint use of service areas for multiple buildings on a site. 
4.  Where possible, utilize building forms and other integral design techniques to conceal service areas from view. Locate trash receptacles and dumpsters adjacent to truck loading areas and screen with walls that are coordinated with the building's architecture. 
5.  Where dumpsters are not incorporated within the overall building envelope, apply the following standards: 
a.  For dumpsters not located next to the building, use wall, fence or gating on all four sides, with the open (or gated) side facing away from the view of streets or adjacent residential areas. Additional landscape areas are encouraged adjacent to dumpster locations. 
b.  Locate dumpsters at edges of specific use areas rather in the middle of an open space, parking lot, or along streets. 
6.  Utility service areas should be screened from public view with architectural materials and colors that are harmonious with the building; and/or with landscape plantings that can be incorporated as a part of visual screen. See figure 24 for example of utilities screened by a low wall that matches the structure. 

7.  Locate all above grade utility connections, vents, and other projections through exterior walls away from high visibility areas, such as front facades or pedestrian areas, preferably in the service area of the building. Do not locate any utility projections or equipment, such as air conditioning units or air exchangers on the street side of the building. 
8.  Rooftop mechanical equipment shall not be mounted on the buildings unless the roof itself acts as a screen or other integral architectural treatment is provided to screen such equipment from view. 
O.  Fence and wall design. Fence and wall design is permitted as a design element as well as for security or to screen site elements. 
1.  Any fence and/or wall constructed for purposes of security or to screen site elements shall comply with the architectural, design and landscaping requirements of this schedule and schedule J and other regulations herein. 
a.  Fences, railings and walls shall not interfere with pedestrian safety by blocking access from the street to the sidewalk. 
b.  Where permitted, all outdoor storage areas shall be visually screened with attractive fencing/walls and landscaping.

i.  Barbed wire shall be reviewed and may be approved by the planning and zoning commission if a need for such security is demonstrated by the applicant with clear and convincing evidence. Barbed wire is prohibited as part of 1) any residential use; or 2) any mixed-use having a residential component. If barbed wire is used, it shall be oriented toward the interior of the property and included in the overall fence height measurement. Barbed wire is prohibited on any fence within a front yard or a yard along a major street. 
d.  The following height requirements shall be imposed: 
i.  Front yards: four feet for a fence or wall without landscaping and six feet for a fence or wall of any style landscaped. 
ii.  Side and rear yards: eight feet for a fence or wall of any style or a hedge in the side and rear yards or six feet for a fence or wall of any style without landscaping. 
iii.  Fences and walls shall not exceed the required height except where determined that increased height is compatible with the use of the property, does not detract from the pedestrian character of the street, and is integrated into the architecture and design. 
e.  All fences and walls shall be installed with the finished side facing towards the exterior of adjoining properties and rights-of-ways. 
f.  Fence, wall or hedge surfaces shall not be used for advertising or display. 
g.  The walls of any building which enclose a yard or are visible from a street frontage shall be stained, painted, or provided with an integral color, as appropriate to the wall surface material used, and permanently maintained. 
h.  On commercial or office properties visible from any major street, fences and walls shall be decorative or dark vinyl-coated chain-link (including stands, poles and rails). 
i.  The attachment of slats, fabric, shade cloth or other material to a chain link or similar open fence is prohibited except as provided herein. Slats, fabric, shade cloth or other material is not a permitted method for required screening of outdoor storage areas. Slats, fabric, shade cloth or other material may be installed to create a wind barrier for athletic courts or similar situations subject to the following conditions: 
i.  Professional installation is required by a licensed contractor. 
ii.  The proposed material shall be designed to withstand wind resistance with commercial grade seams and attached at grommets designed in a manner consistent with building regulations. 
j.  It is prohibited and unlawful for any person to construct, maintain, place, install or allow or cause to be constructed, maintained, placed, or installed on or about any structure or property any fence, barrier, partition, obstruction or similar structure that is electrically charged or connected with any electrical source in such a manner as to transmit an electrical charge to persons, animals or things which come in contact with fence. 
P.  Vehicular circulation. Vehicular circulation within a site is critical for usability of a place. See figures 25 and 26 for examples of parking lots that provide a continuous flow of traffic through the lot. When laying out vehicular circulation the following standards shall be met: 


1.  Access drive on side streets are encouraged to maintain efficient traffic flow on major roadways. 
2.  The parking lots and driveways must be designed for sufficient movement to avoid conflict with vehicular traffic in the street. 
3.  Delivery vehicles shall not be permitted to stop or park and impede traffic and shall use designated delivery spaces for all deliveries. 
4.  Delivery and loading operations shall be designed and located in a way that mitigates circulation impacts to internal traffic flow and adjoining residential neighborhoods. 
5.  The parking layout shall provide a continuous flow of traffic through the lot. 
6.  Place at least 30 percent of parking surface area to the rear or side of buildings and/or away from public streets. 
7.  Driveways shall be shared and provide cross-access between adjoining parking areas and circulation drives to reduce the number of turns onto and off of the principal roadways and to minimize conflict points. Adjoining commercial and office sites that are higher traffic generators shall provide cross-access for circulation between sites and to minimize curb cuts. Cross access easement shall be granted use pursuant to a form of easement acceptable to the city attorney. 
8.  Transit vehicle access shall be incorporated and attractive and convenient waiting areas and shelters shall be provided to facilitate the use of public transportation for multi-tenant buildings. 
Q.  Pedestrian circulation. Defined pedestrian circulation routes shall be provided into and within a site. See figure 27 for example of decorative pavers used in pedestrian crossings that provide clear delineation for pedestrian path of travel. Multiple pedestrian routes may be required based on the size of a site or other conditions. 

1.  Parking areas shall be designed for pedestrian safety with walkways parallel to parking aisles. The design shall minimize the need for a pedestrian to cross parking aisles and landscape islands to reach building entries. See figure 28 for example of design that places walkways parallel to parking aisles. 

Accent materials such as decorative concrete or unit pavers shall be used to emphasize pedestrian crossing at driveways and major circulation aisles. 
2.  Outparcels shall have direct pedestrian connections to any adjacent public sidewalk streets and to other adjacent buildings. 
3.  Sidewalks are required at vehicular access points into a development, unless a reasonable alternative location is provided, which provides the same function and connectivity. 
4.  Multi-tenant buildings shall provide a pedestrian connection from transit stops. 
5.  Multi-tenant buildings shall provide a break, or pedestrian pass-through, for every 600 feet of building frontage. The purpose of pedestrian pass throughs is to provide connections to parking, adjacent development, or similar uses. The following requirements are applicable: 
a.  Provide logical building breaks. 
b.  Align with central pedestrian corridor if allowed. 
c.  The minimum width is 15 feet between buildings. Larger building breaks may serve as a pedestrian plaza with appropriate scale, sizing and seating opportunities. 
d.  Direct pedestrian access is required to connect parking located on opposite sides of a building. 
e.  If a sidewalk between buildings is provided, a landscape area of a minimum five feet in width must remain between the building and sidewalk. 
f.  Vehicular access may be incorporated at time of development review.

Luminaires shall not be tilted. Lighting of or on buildings shall be limited to wall washer type fixtures or up-lights, which do not produce spill light or glare. 
5.  A fully cutoff fixture shall be installed in a horizontal position as designed. 
6.  Security lighting fixtures and wall packs shall not project above the fascia or roof line of the building on which they are mounted and shall use fully cutoff or fully shielded fixtures. All security lighting fixtures and wall packs shall be shielded and aimed so that illumination is directed only to the designated area and shall not cast direct light on other areas. 
7.  Wall packs are permitted only in loading and service areas and shall be cutoff fixtures except those adjacent to an arterial or collector road, in or adjacent to a residential zoning district or adjacent to a dwelling unit which is of the shoe box type. The lighting use or location of the wall pack shall determine the maximum foot-candle allowed except as otherwise provided herein. 
8.  Flood lighting is discouraged. If used, flood lights must be shielded to prevent: 
i.  Disability glares for drivers or pedestrians. 
ii.  Light trespass beyond the property line. 
iii.  Light above a 90 degree horizontal plane. 
iv.  Otherwise creating a public hazard or nuisance. 
9.  All sag lenses, drop lenses and convex lenses are prohibited. See figure 29. 

10.  Adjacent to residential property, no direct light source shall be visible at the property line at ground level or above. Illumination levels at all property lines shall not exceed 0.5 foot-candles (f.c.) when the building or parking areas are located adjacent to residential area, and shall not exceed 1.0 f.c. when abutting other non-residential properties. To avoid glare or spill light from encroaching onto adjacent properties, illumination shall be installed with house side shields and reflectors, and shall be maintained in such a manner as to confine light rays to the premises of the building or project. 
11.  All lighting within parking and pedestrian areas shall be coordinated with the landscape plan to prevent canopy conflicts with the proposed or existing trees. 
12.  The minimum setback of a light source from a property line shall be a horizontal distance of 20 feet. 
13.  Non-residential light shall be installed with time controls to ensure that light levels are reduced not later than 1 hour after the close of operations to the minimum levels needed under IESNA to ensure safety and security (approximately a 50 percent reduction). 
14.  To provide lighting that limits distortion of colors of the building, landscape and pedestrian activity areas, all lighting lamp sources within parking and pedestrian areas shall be metal halide, compact fluorescent, LED or high pressure sodium. 
15.  All lots with alleys shall have lighting fixtures within five feet of the alley's edge of pavement where it does not conflict with vehicle access and circulation. The fixture shall illuminate the alley, between eight feet and 12 feet in height, and not cause glare into adjacent lots. When a structure in the lot is within five feet of the alley's edge, the lighting fixture shall be attached to the structure and not to a light pole. 
16.  Building light fixtures should be designed to be architecturally compatible with the main structure, which should complement the theme of the surrounding area. 
17.  Blinking, flashing lights and exposed neon lighting used to illuminate building facades or to outline buildings are prohibited except as may be exempt herein. 
18.  The following are general requirements for lighting placement: 
a.  At least three feet away from the face of the curb (to avoid damage from car bumpers and door swings). 
b.  At least five feet from the point where a curb transitions into a driveway, curb cut or alley. 
c.  At least 20 feet from the extended flow line of the nearest intersection. 
19.  The following are general requirements for parking area lighting: 
a.  Light pole height in all parking areas shall not exceed 25 feet. 
b.  The style of light standards in a parking lot shall relate to the overall architectural design of the commercial uses. See figure 30 for example of pedestrian-scaled parking lot lighting. 

c.  Select lighting with a concealed light source of the "cut-off" variety to prevent glare and "light trespass" onto adjacent buildings and sites. 
d.  Provide separate, pedestrian scale lighting for all pedestrian ways through parking lots. Locate poles in parking islands wherever possible with a maximum base height of two feet. 
e.  Parking area light poles placed outside of parking islands are permittable if the poles are located in an area that is protected or the pole foundation has been designed to accept minimal levels of vehicular impact. All exposed pole foundations shall be aesthetically designed to match the detailing of the primary structure (i.e. stucco finished with matching paint color) and shall be surrounded by a six-inch foundation curb. See figure 31. 

20.  The following are general requirements for pedestrian area lighting: 
a.  Light pole heights in all parking areas shall not exceed 15 feet. See figure 32. 

b.  The light fixture/luminaire shall be decorative in appearance, style and finish. 
c.  The lamp source shall be metal halide, LED, or compact fluorescent of a light source that produces a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 65 or higher. Wattage shall not exceed 100 watts per bulb. 
d.  Illumination levels shall range between a minimum of 0.2 f.c. and a maximum of 2.5 f.c. 
e.  Pedestrian street lights must be placed two feet from the back of curb on each side of the street and travel lanes, unless otherwise indicated. 

f.  A combination of International Dark-Sky Association ("IDA") permitted pole lights, bollard lighting and landscape accent lighting are an encouraged design. 
21.  A pedestrian lighting plan shall incorporate a combination of pole light, bollard light and accent lighting. See Figure 32, Figure 33, and Figure 34. 

E.  Lighting Standards. 
1.  Lighting intensities for buildings, projects, or other uses not specifically regulated by this schedule (for example athletic fields, courts and swimming pools) shall be designed as recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). However, all such uses shall comply with this schedule for control of glare and light level at the property line. 
2.  The city hereby adopts the following outdoor lighting recommendations of the IESNA:

1.  Lighting of gas stations and convenience stores shall not be used to attract attention to the business. 
2.  Areas on the apron away from the gasoline pump islands which are used for parking or vehicle storage shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements for parking areas set forth in schedule G. If no gasoline pumps are provided, the entire apron shall be treated as a parking area. 
3.  Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy. See figure 35 for example of recessed lighting at gas station canopy that creates a well-lit space without causing glare. 

G.  Lighting plan required. The applicant shall submit a lighting plan depicting the foot-candle dispersion on the site and detail of the proposed fixtures as part of the site plan/development application. The plan shall include at least the following: 
1.  A site plan, drawn to scale, showing all buildings, landscaping, parking areas, all proposed exterior lighting fixtures; 
2.  Specifications (details) for all proposed lighting fixtures including photometric data. designation as IESNA 'cutoff' fixtures, and other descriptive information on the fixtures; 
3.  Proposed mounting height of all exterior lighting fixtures; 
4.  Analyses and luminance level diagrams showing that the proposed installation conforms to the lighting standards of this section. Off-site lighting shall be considered in the analyses; and 
5.  Drawing of all relevant building elevations showing the fixtures, the portions of the walls to be illuminated, the luminance levels of the walls and the aiming points for any remote light fixtures. 
H.  Technical deviations. The applicant shall submit a lighting plan depicting the foot-candle dispersion on the site and detail of the proposed fixtures as part of the site plan/development application. The plan shall include at least the following: 
1.  Any proposal which includes technical deviations from these lighting standards shall demonstrate the unique aesthetic and/or engineering design that meets or is within the intent and purpose of these regulations. Such presentation shall include appropriate calculation and drawings or illustrations as necessary to explain the request or as may be required by the city. 
2.  The building official shall make a determination whether to accept such proposed technical deviation after consulting with a mutually acceptable licensed professional engineer. The cost of making such determination shall be borne by the party requesting the technical deviation. 
I.  Certificate of occupancy. The building official shall not issue a certificate of occupancy until a licensed professional engineer delivers a certificate of compliance to the city stating that the exterior lighting at the building and site complies with this schedule unless an exception was granted. However, where a project is of such a small scale that the lighting layout is considered an incidental engineering service, a certificate of compliance may be rendered by the licensed professional rendering the incidental service if allowed by controlling state law.
