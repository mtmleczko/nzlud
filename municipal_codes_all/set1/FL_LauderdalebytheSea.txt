PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Florida, of a general and permanent nature. 
    The Code has been republished in 2009 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 19 to the 1988 publication, up to and including Ord. No. 2007-15, adopted on September 25, 2007, and this republication constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, as supplemented through September 1978, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 3 is 3-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-1 and 5-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-1.1, 5-1.2 and 5-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 10 and 11, it will be designated as Chapter 10.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
Charter CHT:1 Charter Comparative Table CHTCT:1 Code CD1:1 Code Appendix CDA:1 Code Comparative Tables CCT:1 Charter Index CHTi:1 Code Index CDi:1  
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful keeping of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was by Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mayor Wally Kilday, George H. Spare, Town Manager, and Joseph F. Daly, Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Town's affairs. 
    The republication of the Code was under the direct supervision of Regina Sosinski, Editor, and Rachael Jamison, Proofreader, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.

It is the express intent of this provision, however, that such inquiry shall not interfere directly with the regular municipal operations of the Town and that recommendations for change or improvements in Town government operations be made to and through the Town Manager. 
ARTICLE IV. - INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM 

Sec. 4.1. - Power to initiate and reconsider ordinances. 
(1)  Initiated ordinances. The registered voters of the Town shall have power to propose ordinances to the Commission and, if the Commission fails to adopt an ordinance so proposed without any change in substance, to adopt or reject it by a referendum vote at a Town election. 
(2)  Repeal and amendment of adopted ordinances. The registered voters of the Town shall have power to require reconsideration by the Commission of any adopted ordinance and, if the Commission fails to repeal or amend as proposed in the initiative petition an ordinance so reconsidered, to amend or repeal it by a referendum vote at a Town election. 
Sec. 4.2. - Commencement of initiative. 
(1)  Filing with Town Clerk. A minimum of ten registered electors (voters) of the Town may commence initiative, repeal or amendment proceedings by filing with the Town Clerk an affidavit stating that they will constitute the petitioners' committee and be responsible for circulating the petition and filing it in proper form, stating their names and addresses, specifying the address to which all notices to the petitioners' committee are to be sent, and setting out in full the proposed initiated ordinance or citing the ordinance sought to be reconsidered. Promptly after the affidavit of a petitioners' committee is filed, the Town Clerk may, at the committee's request and at their expense, issue the appropriate petition blanks to the petitioners' committee. 
(2)  Review by the Town Attorney. Prior to circulation, a petition and the proposed ordinance, if any, shall be reviewed as to legal form by the Town Attorney. The Town Attorney's review of a petition package shall not extend to review of the substance of a proposed ordinance, or an ordinance proposed for repeal or amendment, but shall be strictly limited to a review as to legal form. No later than fourteen (14) calendar days from filing date of a petition with the Town Clerk, the Town Attorney shall, by hand delivery or registered mail, inform the petitioners' committee and Town Clerk either that the petition and ordinance, if any, are in proper legal form or, if not, then specifically what measures are required to render them in proper form. Upon request by the petitioners' committee, the Town Attorney will assist the committee to render documents in proper legal form for consideration by the Town Commission, but will not offer legal counsel or opinions to the petitioners' committee or its representative. Failure by the Town Attorney to inform the petitioners' committee and Town Clerk of his or her determination as to form within fourteen (14) calendar days after the petitioner files a petition and proposed ordinance, or petition for reconsideration of an ordinance, with the Town Clerk shall be deemed a determination that the document(s) is/are in proper legal form.

Each paper of a petition shall have attached to it when filed an affidavit by the circulator thereof stating that he or she personally circulated the paper, the number of signatures thereon, that all the signatures were affixed in his or her presence, that he or she believes them to be the genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be and that each signer had an opportunity before signing to read the full text of the ordinance proposed or required to be reconsidered. 
(4)  Filing deadline. All initiative and referendum petitions must be filed with 60 days of the date on which proceedings with respect to such initiatives are commenced. 
Sec. 4.4. - Filing procedure. 
(1)  Certificate of Clerk; amendment . Within 20 days after an initiative petition is filed or within five days after a petition for repeal or amendment of an ordinance is filed, the Clerk shall complete a certificate as to its sufficiency (the "Certificate"). Grounds for insufficiency are only those specified in Sec. 4.3 of this Article. If insufficient, the Certificate shall specify the particulars of the deficiency. A copy of the Certificate shall be promptly sent to the petitioners' committee by hand delivery or registered mail. A petition certified insufficient for lack of the required number of valid signatures may be amended once if the petitioners' committee files a notice of intention to amend it with the Clerk within two business days after receiving the copy of the Certificate and files a supplementary petition upon additional papers within fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving the copy of the Certificate. Such supplementary petition shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 4.3 of this Article. Within five business days after a supplementary petition is filed, the Clerk shall complete a Certificate as to the sufficiency of the petition, as amended, and shall promptly send a copy of such Certificate to the petitioners' committee by registered mail or hand delivery as in the case of an original petition. If a petition or amended petition is certified sufficient, or if a petition or amended petition is certified insufficient and the petitioners' committee does not elect to amend or request Commission review under subsection (2) of this Section 4.4 within the time required, the Clerk shall promptly present the Certificate to the Commission and such Certificate shall then be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
(2)  Commission review as to sufficiency. If a petition has been certified insufficient and the petitioners' committee does not file notice of intention to amend it or if an amended petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within two business days after receiving the copy of such Certificate, file a request that it be reviewed by the Commission. The Commission shall then review the Certificate at its next meeting following the filing of such request and approve or disapprove it, and the Commission's determination shall then be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
Sec. 4.5. - Action on petitions. 
(1)  Action by Town Commission. When an initiative petition or a petition for the repeal or amendment of an existing ordinance has been finally determined to be sufficient, the Town Commission shall promptly consider or reconsider the ordinance. Whether or not the Commission approves at first reading an initiated ordinance, or the repeal or amendment, as proposed, of a referred ordinance, the Commission shall proceed to a second reading at its next scheduled meeting, and shall otherwise comply with all requirements under Sec. 166.041 F. S. for public notice and public hearings prior to the adoption of an ordinance. If the Commission fails to adopt a proposed initiative ordinance without any change in substance within forty-five (45) calendar days, or fails to repeal or amend a referred ordinance in accordance with the initiative petition within thirty (30) calendar days, it shall submit the proposed or referred ordinance to the registered voters of the Town by referendum vote at an election. The referendum vote by registered Town voters shall constitute an "additional requirement for the enactment of ordinances" as specified in paragraph (6) of Section 166.041 F.S., in lieu of and as a greater, increased requirement than the affirmative majority vote of the governing body referred to in paragraph (4) of Sec. 166.041 F. S. If the Commission fails to act on a proposed initiative ordinance or a referred ordinance within the time period specified in this paragraph, the Commission shall be deemed to have failed to adopt the proposed initiative ordinance or failed to repeal or amend the referred ordinance on the last day that the Commission was authorized to act on such matter. In that event, the Commission shall nevertheless comply with the public notice and public hearing requirements of Sec. 166.04 F.S. relative to the ordinance in question. 
(2)  Submission to voters. The vote of the Town on a proposed referred ordinance shall be held not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of Commission acted or was deemed to have acted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this section. If no regular election is to be held within the period described in this paragraph, the Commission shall provide for a special election, except that the Commission may, in its discretion provide for a special election at an earlier date within the described period. Copies of the proposed or referred ordinance shall be made available at the polls. 
(3)  Withdrawal of petitions. An initiative or referendum petition may be withdrawn at any time prior to the fifteenth (15th) day preceding the day scheduled for a vote of the Town by filing with the Town Clerk a request for withdrawal signed by at least eight-tenths of the members of the petitioners' committee. Upon the filing of such request, the petition shall have no further force or effect and all proceedings thereon shall be terminated. 
Sec. 4.6. - Results of election. 
(1)  Initiative. If a majority of the registered voters voting on a proposed initiative ordinance vote in its favor, it shall be considered adopted upon certification of the election results. If conflicting ordinances are approved at the same election, the one receiving the greater or greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. 
(2)  Repeal and amendment of referred ordinances. If a majority of the registered voters voting on a referred ordinance vote for repeal or for amendment, it shall be considered repealed or amended, as appropriate, upon certification of the election results. 
Sec. 4.7. - Ordinances affecting initiated ordinances; procedure for adoption. 
    An ordinance passed as a result of a vote of the registered voters of the Town, whether prior or subsequent to the effective date of this Article, may be repealed or amended only by a similar vote of the registered voters of the Town. The Town Commission may, by resolution, submit to the registered voters of the Town at any regular or special election for a referendum vote, a proposed ordinance to repeal or amend any such ordinance. Notice of the Town Commission's intention to submit such a proposed ordinance to the registered voters shall be published by the Town Commission no less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to such election, in the manner required for the publication of initiated ordinances. If an amendment is so proposed, such notice shall contain the proposed amendment in full.

ARTICLE VII. - PLANNING AND ZONING 

Sec. 7.1. - Maximum height for buildings established; referendum vote required for increases in zoned residential-district height limits. 
(1)  No building within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Town, as they existed on March 20, 2006, shall have more than four (4) stories above grade, and the maximum height of buildings within the Town that have four (4) stories above grade shall be forty-four (44) feet above grade, as defined in the Florida Building Code, or above a horizontal plane eighteen inches above the crown of the roadway at the highest point adjoining the property on which the building is located, whichever of those two levels is higher. The maximum height for all other buildings within the Town shall be thirty-three (33) feet 
(a)  Above grade, as defined in the Florida Building Code, or 
(b)  Above a horizontal plane eighteen inches above the crown if the roadway at the highest point adjoining the property on which the building is located, or 
(c)  Above the minimum elevation for a habitable, finished floor permitted under applicable federal or Florida state regulations, 
Whichever of those three levels is highest. Height shall be measured from the applicable base level specified above to the highest point on a flat roof, or to the median elevation between the peak of a sloped roof and the lowest edge of the sloped roof. In accordance with the Florida Building Code, bulkheads and penthouses used solely to enclose stairways, tanks, elevator machinery or shafts or ventilation or air conditioning apparatus shall not be included in determining building height; all other roofs structures, including parapet walls, shall not exceed four feet in height above the maximum allowed building height. 
(2)  In any building within the Town that has more than three (3) stories above grade, the first story shall be at grade level and shall be used for parking, either with or without toll collection booths. The first story may also be used for storage, refuse, security, registration, maintenance, and/or access, either with or without a lobby, provided that at least one-half (1/2) of the square footage of the first story is used for parking. Only within districts of the Town zoned for business ("B") use, the first story of buildings having more than three (3) stories above grade may also be devoted to non-residential commercial uses, provided that dedicated parking required by Town ordinance or code for the proposed buildings is provided off-street at a location on or adjacent to the property on which the buildings are situate, and designed so as to enable the parked vehicles to egress the parking space without having to back out into traffic. In any building within the Town that has more than three (3) stories above grade, the first story shall be restricted to the above enumerated uses, and may be used for no other purpose whatsoever. For the purposes of this provision of the Charter, a story is at grade level if its floor is at or below grade and its ceiling is above grade; a story that is at grade level is also above grade. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed so as to prohibit any building within the Town that has more than three (3) stories above grade from also having one (1) or more subterranean stories below grade, provided, however, that in any building within the Town that has more than three (3) stories above grade, all subterranean stories shall be subject to the same restrictions on use as are established in this paragraph for the first story. 
(3)  Buildings which exceed thirty three (33) feet above grade, and which exceed thirty three (33) feet above the horizontal plane eighteen inches above the crown of the roadway at the highest point adjoining the property on which the building is located, but which are nevertheless allowed under subparagraph (1)(c) of this Section, and which do not include a non-habitable first floor with ample parking as required by Town ordinance or code, in accordance with the number and type of units in those buildings, must have dedicated off-street parking at a location on or adjacent to the property on which the buildings are situate. Parking for buildings in this category must be designed so as to enable the parked vehicles to egress the parking space without having to back out into traffic. 
(4)  All existing buildings within the Town that were legally in compliance with existing height and use restrictions on March 20, 2006, or were grandfathered on that date, but that either exceed the maximum building height limit established in paragraph (1), above, of this section of the Charter, or that fail to comply, where applicable, with the restrictions on use established in paragraph (2), above, of this section of the Charter, (hereinafter referred to as "Non-conforming Buildings") shall be considered legal, but non-conforming. 
(5)  Notwithstanding the maximum building height limit established in paragraph (1), above, of this section of the Charter, an existing non-conforming building may be replaced by a new nonconforming building when, and only when: 
(a)  The existing non-conforming building has: 
(i)  Been destroyed by fire, natural disaster, or other act of God; and 
(ii)  The property owner has submitted and received Town approval of a site plan depicting the replacement building; and 
(iii)  Construction of the replacement building is commenced within twelve (12) months of the date of destruction; or 
(b)  The existing non-conforming building is: 
(i)  Demolished as part of a Town approved redevelopment of the property; and 
(ii)  Prior to demolition, the property owner has submitted and received Town approval of a site plan depicting the replacement building; and 
(iii)  Construction of the replacement building is commenced within six (6) months of the date of site plan approval. 
(c)  The Town Commission may grant one (1) or more six (6) month extensions to the time periods for commencement of construction established in paragraphs (5)(a)(iii) and (5)(b)(iii), above, provided a written request for extension is filed with the Town Clerk prior to (in the case of a first request for extension) the expiration of the initial applicable time period for commencement of construction or prior to (in the case of a subsequent request for extension) the expiration of the most recent extension of the applicable time period for commencement of construction. 
(d)  All new non-conforming buildings constructed pursuant to the provisions of either paragraph (5)(a) or (5)(b), above, shall comply, where applicable, with the restrictions on use established in paragraph (2), above, and the provisions for parking availability established in paragraph (3), above, of this section of the Charter. 
(e)  The maximum allowable height of any new non-conforming building constructed pursuant to the provisions of either paragraph (5)(a) or (5)(b), above, shall not exceed the original height of the non-conforming building which it replaces, plus any additional height which (because of the requirements of state or federal law, or because of the restrictions on use established in paragraph (2), above, of this section of the charter) may be necessary to obtain the same number of habitable stories as was contained in the original non-conforming building. Nothing in this section of the Charter shall be construed to prevent a new non-conforming building from being constructed to a lesser height or from containing fewer habitable stories than that of the original non-conforming building which it replaces. For the purposes of this provision of the Charter, the term "habitable story" means any story or part thereof that is used as a home or place of abode, either permanent or temporary, by one (1) or more persons. 
(f)  The maximum allowable square footage of any new nonconforming building constructed pursuant to the provisions of either paragraph (5)(a) or (5)(b), above, shall not exceed the original square footage of the non-conforming building which it replaces, plus any additional square footage which (because of the requirements of state or federal law, or because of the restrictions on use established in paragraph (2), above, of this section of the Charter) may be necessary to obtain the same number of habitable square feet as was contained in the original non-conforming building. Nothing in this section of the Charter shall be construed to prevent a new nonconforming building from being constructed either with less total square footage or with less habitable square footage than that of the original non-conforming building which it replaces. For the purposes of this section of the Charter, the term "habitable square footage" means the square footage of that portion of a building that is used as a home or place of abode, either permanent or temporary, by one (1) or more persons. 
(6)  The maximum building height limits, the restrictions on use and the maximum allowable square footage, and the provisions governing parking established in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (5), above, of this section of the Charter, shall be applicable to all real property located within the boundaries of the Town as the boundaries exist on March 20, 2006. 
(7)  Every resident of the Town shall have the standing to enforce the maximum building height limits and the maximum allowable square footage established in paragraphs (1), (2) and (5), above, of this section of the Charter, by means of a suit in equity seeking either mandamus; prohibition; or any combination thereof, but nothing in this provision of the Charter shall he construed to either create a cause of action at law for money damages, or to authorize a court of equity to award money damages as an incident to equitable relief, or to authorize an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party or to any other party. 
(8)  The maximum building height limit established in paragraph (1), above, of this section of the Charter, supersedes any existing zoning ordinance or land development regulation to the extent that said zoning ordinance or land development regulation establishes anywhere within the Town a maximum building height limit greater than that established in paragraph (1), above, of this section of the Charter, but nothing in this section of the Charter shall be construed to supersede, modify or repeal any existing zoning ordinance or land development regulation that establishes anywhere within the Town a maximum building height limit lower than that established in paragraph (1), above, of this section of the Charter. 
(9)  The Town Commission may not increase, by ordinance or by variance, the maximum building height limits established in paragraphs (1) and (5), above, of this section of the Charter, nor may the Town Commission modify, amend or repeal, by ordinance or by variance, the restrictions on use established in paragraph (2), above, or the provisions for parking availability established in paragraphs (2), (3) or (5), above, of this section of the Charter, nor may the Town Commission increase, by ordinance or by variance, the maximum allowable square footage established in paragraph (5), above, of this section of the Charter. The maximum height limits established for residential zoning districts including, but not limited to, R-5, RS-4, RS-5, RD-10, RM-15, RM-16, RM-25 and PUD in the Town's land development code as of March 20, 2006, may be increased, or such districts re-zoned for any other use whatsoever, only by a referendum vote of the registered voters of the Town in the manner established in Article IV, Section 4.7 [50] of this Charter for the repeal or amendment of initiated ordinances. The Town may not create new categories of zoning without approval of such categories by a similar referendum vote; and all provisions of such new categories of zoning must be submitted to the voters for approval. 
(10)  The maximum building height limits established in paragraphs (1) and (5), above, of this section of the Charter, may be increased only by an amendment to or by repeal of this section of the Charter. The restrictions on use established in paragraph (2), above, and the provisions governing parking availability established in paragraphs (2), (3) and (5), above, of this section of the Charter, may be modified, amended or repealed only by an amendment to or by repeal of this section of the Charter. The maximum allowable square footage established in paragraph (5), above, of this provision of the Charter, may be increased only by an amendment to, or by repeal of this section of the Charter. Except as expressly provided below, this section of the Charter may be amended or repealed only by means of a majority vote of the registered voters of the Town at a referendum election held either on the same day as a regularly scheduled November general election or on the same day as a regularly scheduled March municipal general election. The amendment or repeal of this section of the Charter at a special election held on a day other than a regularly scheduled November general election or on a day other than a regularly scheduled March municipal general election is expressly prohibited, except that a special election or special election by mail may be held to correct, to the minimum practicable extent, a provision adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to violate the State or Federal Constitution or any valid state or federal law, but only after such adjudication is affirmed on appeal. Amendments approved at a special election may include no elements not directly related to such court adjudication. 
(11)  These provisions of the Charter shall be effective immediately upon adoption by a majority of the registered voters of the Town voting in a referendum to amend the Charter so as to include these provisions. Upon adoption, the maximum building height limits, the restrictions on use, the maximum allowable square footage and the provisions governing parking availability established in paragraphs (1), (2, (3) and (5), above, of this section of the Charter, shall immediately apply to all real property located within the boundaries of the entire Town. Upon adoption of these provisions, and pending amendment of any portion or portions of the Town's Code of Ordinances inconsistent with this section of the Charter, the more stringent provisions of this section shall apply.

(3)  Any referendum election called for the purpose of authorizing the vacating, abandonment, lease, sale, transfer of possession or transfer of ownership of the El Prado Property shall be held either on the same day as a regularly scheduled November general election or on the same day as a regularly scheduled March municipal election.

(1)  Lobbyist obligations . Prior to engaging in any lobbying activities, whether or not compensation is paid or received in connection with those activities, each lobbyist shall do the following: 
a.  Annual registration statement required. File with the Town Manager or designee, in form prescribed by the Town Manager or designee, an annual registration statement under oath containing the following information:

5.  A lobbyist representing a group, association, or organization shall, prior to engaging in lobbying, receive appropriate authorization from said group, association, or organization to lobby on its behalf upon a particular subject matter. A copy of the applicable minutes, motion, or other documentation of the action providing such authorization shall be attached to the registration statements. 
6.  A lobbyist representing a principal or employer shall file a copy of a written statement of the principal or employer confirming authorization to lobby for the principal or employer. 
7.  If, after filing the registration statement, the lobbyist intends to lobby on behalf of any person(s) not listed on the registration statement or on a subject matter not previously identified, the lobbyist shall, prior to engaging in any lobbying activities on behalf of such unlisted person(s), file an amendment to the registration statement in form prescribed by the Town Manager or designee, containing all the information required in the annual registration statement. 
b.  Fee required . Pay to the Town an annual $50.00 registration fee for each employer or principal, identified on an annual or amended registration statement, on whose behalf he or she intends to lobby, whether he or she was retained directly by the employer or principal or by another lobbyist retained by the employer or principal. The registration fees required by this section shall be expended by the Town solely for the purpose of defraying the administrative costs of implementing, monitoring, and otherwise ensuring compliance with this section. A lobbyist who is lobbying as a volunteer, without any compensation, is not required to pay a registration fee in connection with those uncompensated lobbying activities, but still must otherwise meet the requirements of this section. 
c.  Amended statement . A lobbyist is required to promptly amend any filed registration statement if any information in the statement changes. 
d.  Disclosure statement required . 
1.  On or before January 15 of each year, each lobbyist shall submit to the Town Manager or designee, in form prescribed by the Town Manager or designee, a signed statement under oath, disclosing all Town lobbying expenditures, contingency fees, and the sources from which funds for making such expenditures and paying such contingency fees have come. The statement shall provide such information with respect to all lobbying activities undertaken from January 1 of the prior year through December 31 of the year in which such disclosure statement is required to be filed. Lobbying expenditures shall not include personal expenses for lodging, meals, and travel. A statement shall be filed even if there have been no expenditures during a reported period. Any individual who is exempt from the definition of lobbyist pursuant to subsection 2-1(a) shall not be required to file the statement required by this subsection. 
2.  The Town Manager or designee shall provide for a procedure by which a lobbyist who fails to timely file a disclosure statement shall be notified and assessed fines. The procedure shall provide for the following: 
i.  Upon determining that the statement is late, the person designated to review the timeliness of the statement shall promptly notify the lobbyist as to the failure to timely file the statement and that a fine is being assessed for each late day. The fine shall be $50.00 per day for each late day. 
ii.  Upon receipt of the late-filed statement, the person designated to review the timeliness of the statement shall determine the amount of the fine due. A fine shall not be assessed against a lobbyist the first time any statement for which the lobbyist is responsible is not timely filed, provided all statements for which the lobbyist is responsible are filed within 20 days after receipt of notice that any statements have not been timely filed. A fine shall be assessed for any subsequent late-filed statement. 
iii.  Such fine shall be paid within 20 days after receipt of the notice of payment due, unless timely appeal is made to the Town Commission. 
iv.  Any lobbyist may appeal a fine, based upon unusual circumstances surrounding the failure to file by the designated due date, and may request and shall be entitled to a hearing before the Town Commission, which shall have the authority to waive the fine in whole or in part for good cause shown. To be entitled to such appeal, the lobbyist must, within 20 days after receipt of the notice of payment due, deliver a letter requesting a hearing to the person designated to review the timeliness of statements. 
e.  Partial year filing required. Discontinuance of lobbying activities during a year shall not relieve the lobbyist of the requirement to file the statement required by subsection 2-1(b)(1)a. above for that portion of the year during which the lobbyist was engaged in lobbying activities. 
f.  Effectiveness . Registration statements are effective from January 1 of a given year through December 31. Registration fees paid under subsection 2-1(b)(1)b. above cover lobbying activities during the effective period of the registration statement. A new registration statement shall be filed, and all required fees shall be paid, prior to engaging in any lobbying activities after expiration of a previously-filed registration statement. 
(2)  List of current lobbyists. The Town shall keep a current list of registered lobbyists and their respective statements required under this section, all of which shall be filed for public inspection. The Town Manager or designee shall routinely provide an updated copy of the lobbyist registration list to the Town Commissioners. 
(c)  Reporting of lobbying activities. 
(1)  Lobbyist contact log . To promote full and complete transparency, lobbyists and their principals or employers who intend to meet or otherwise communicate with an Elected Official for the purpose of engaging in lobbying activities, either at the Elected Official's offices or elsewhere on the Town's premises, must legibly complete a contact log listing each Elected Official with whom the lobbyist, principal, or employer meets or intends to meet or communicate. 
a.  Content . The information stated on the contact log shall include the lobbyist's name; the name of the entity by which the lobbyist is employed; the name of the person or entity for whom or which he or she is lobbying; the name of any employer or principal of the lobbyist who is present at any meeting at which the communication is made; the name of each Elected Official with whom he or she is meeting or communicating; the date and time of each such meeting; and the specific purpose and subject matter of each such meeting. 
b.  Timing, filing. The contact log shall be completed contemporaneously with the meeting(s) and shall be filed for public inspection with the Town. 
(2)  Elected official disclosures . To further promote full and complete transparency, Elected Officials must disclose any and all lobbying activity that knowingly occurs between themselves and individual lobbyists or their principals or employers outside of the Town premises. This shall include communicating by any form of telephonic or electronic media. 
a.  The disclosure shall include the lobbyist's name; the name of the entity by which the lobbyist is employed; the name of the person or entity for whom or which he or she is lobbying; the name of any employer or principal of the lobbyist who is present at any meeting at which the communication is made; the date, time, and location of the meeting; and the specific purpose and subject matter of the meeting. 
b.  The disclosure shall be made within ten business days of the lobbying activity, but must, in any event, be made prior to any vote on a matter that was the subject of the lobbying activity. 
c.  The disclosure shall be filed for public inspection with the Town. 
(d)  Penalties. 
(1)  The Town Manager or designee shall be informed of any person engaged in lobbying activities who has failed to comply with the provisions of this section 2-1, and, in each such instance, shall conduct such investigation as he, she, or they shall deem necessary under the circumstances. The results of each investigation shall be reported to the Town Commission. 
(2)  The Commission shall warn, reprimand, suspend, or prohibit the violator from appearing on behalf of any person before the Town Commission or any decision-making body under the jurisdiction of the Town Commission or from otherwise lobbying the Town for any person in any fashion for a period of time; provided, however, that any suspension or prohibition may not exceed a period of two years, and any of said sanctions shall not be imposed unless the lobbyist (or the employer or principal of the lobbyist, as applicable) allegedly in violation has been afforded reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard. The penalties provided in this subsection 2-1(d) shall be the exclusive penalties imposed for violations of section 2-1. Further, the intentional failure or refusal of any lobbyist to comply with any order of the Town Commission suspending or prohibiting the lobbyist from lobbying shall be punishable as provided by law and shall otherwise be subject to such civil remedies as the Town may pursue, including injunctive relief. 
(3)  The validity of any action taken by the Town Commission, Town employees, or any decision-making body under the jurisdiction of the Town Commission, shall not be affected by the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section 2-1. 
(4)  In addition to all other penalties in this subsection 2-1(d), a competitive solicitation submitted by an employer or principal who has retained a lobbyist(s) to lobby in connection with that solicitation shall be deemed non-responsive unless the employer or principal, in responding to the competitive solicitation, certifies that each lobbyist retained has timely filed the required registration or amended registration. If, after awarding a contract in connection with the solicitation, the Town learns that the certification was erroneous, and upon investigation determines that the error was willful or intentional on the part of the employer or principal, the Town may, on that basis, exercise any contractual right to terminate the contract for convenience. 
(5)  Except where a specific penalty or sanction is otherwise provided for above in this subsection 2-1(d), this section 2-1 shall be subject to enforcement under the Local Government Code Enforcement Act, F.S. ch. 162, as amended, and Chapter 6.5 "Code Enforcement" of the Town Code, as amended. Enforcement may also be by suit for declaratory, injunctive or other appropriate relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Town hereby expressly reserves its right, power and authority to act as the civil or administrative agency having jurisdiction concerning an alleged violation of this section 2-1, and this reservation shall serve to fully preserve the Town's investigative and enforcement authority.

The foregoing conduct is unauthorized and, if the individual engaged in the conduct has not been recognized and granted leave to speak by the Presiding Officer, any person who causes an interruption of the meeting shall be given the option to cease the conduct which constitutes an interruption or to leave the meeting. If the individual fails to cease the offending conduct or to voluntarily leave the meeting and continues interrupting the meeting, the individual shall be removed from the meeting room if the Sergeant-At-Arms is so directed by the Presiding Officer, and such person shall be barred from further audience for the remainder of the meeting. In case the Presiding Officer shall fail to act, any member of the Town Commission may move to require the Presiding Officer to act to enforce the rules, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the Town Commission or Board shall require the Presiding Officer to act. 
(b)  Any person who, at a Town Commission or Board meeting, willfully interrupts or disturbs such meeting in violation of F.S.  871.01, entitled "Disturbing Schools and Religious and Other Assemblies," may be arrested by those Police Officers present.

Sec. 2-25. - Campaign finance restrictions. 
(a)  General prohibition of campaign contributions by Town vendors; disqualification; definitions. 
(1)  a.  No vendor shall give, solicit for, deliver or provide a campaign contribution directly or indirectly to a candidate, or to the campaign committee of a candidate, for the offices of Mayor or Commissioner. Commencing on the effective date of this section, all proposed Town contracts, as well as requests for proposals (RFP), requests for qualifications (RFQ), requests for letters of interest (RFLI), or solicitations of bids issued by the Town, shall incorporate notice of this section so as to notify potential vendors of the proscription embodied herein. 
b.  No candidate or campaign committee of a candidate for the offices of Mayor or Commissioner, shall deposit into such candidate's campaign account any campaign contribution which is received directly or indirectly from a vendor or which such candidate or campaign committee knows or should know was solicited by or for a vendor or delivered or provided by a vendor. Candidates or those acting on their behalf shall ensure compliance with this Code section by confirming through examination of the official vendor list maintained by the Town to verify the vendor status of any potential contributor. A candidate or the campaign committee of a candidate shall not be in violation of this paragraph b. if the vendor was not listed as a vendor on the Town's official vendor list at the time that the contribution was received or deposited so long as the candidate or the campaign committee of a candidate did not know that the person or entity was a vendor of the Town. 
(2)  Each prohibited act of giving, soliciting for, delivering or providing a campaign contribution or depositing a campaign contribution in violation of this section shall constitute a separate violation. All contributions deposited into a candidate's campaign account in violation of this section shall be forfeited to the Town's general revenue fund. 
(3)  a.  A person or entity, other than a then existing vendor, who directly or indirectly makes a campaign contribution to a candidate who is elected to the office of Mayor or Commissioner shall be disqualified for a period of 12 months following the swearing in of the subject elected official from serving as a vendor with the Town. A then existing vendor who directly or indirectly makes a contribution to a candidate who is elected to the office of Mayor or Commissioner, shall be disqualified from serving as a vendor with the Town for a period of 12 months from a final finding of a violation of this section, or from the time of action on a waiver request by the Town Commission pursuant to paragraph b. below, in the event that a waiver is sought by the vendor. In the event that such waiver request for a particular transaction is granted, the affected vendor shall nonetheless be disqualified from serving as a vendor with the Town as to any other goods, equipment or services to be provided by the vendor to the Town, beyond the vendor goods, equipment or services which are the subject matter of any waiver which is granted. In the event such waiver request is denied for a particular transaction, the 12-month disqualification period shall continue to apply to both the particular transaction for which the waiver was sought, as well as all other vendor activities for the provision of goods, equipment or services to the Town during that 12-month period. 
b.  For purposes of this section, the term "disqualified" shall be defined to include: 
1.  Termination of a contributor/vendor's existing contracts with the Town, subject to the applicable waiver provisions of paragraph (b) herein; and 
2.  Disqualification of a contributor's response to solicitation requests for prospective vendor contracts with the Town, subject to the applicable waiver provisions of paragraph (b) herein. 
(4)  As used in this section: 
a.  Vendor. 
1.  A "vendor" is a person and/or entity who has been selected by the Town as the successful bidder on a present or pending bid to provide to the Town goods, equipment or services, or has been approved by the Town on a present or pending award to provide to the Town goods, equipment or services, prior to, upon or following execution of a contract, or purchase order. 
2.  "Vendor" shall include natural persons and/or entities that hold a controlling financial interest in a vendor entity. The term "controlling financial interest" shall mean the ownership, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the outstanding capital stock in any corporation or a direct or indirect interest of ten percent or more in a firm. The term "firm" shall mean a corporation, partnership, business trust or any legal entity other than a natural person. 
3.  "Vendor" shall include a labor union whose members provide labor services for a vendor entity. 
4.  "Vendor" shall not include Town officers or employees. 
5.  For purposes of this section, "vendor" status shall terminate upon completion of performance of the agreement for the provision of goods, equipment or services. 
b.  Services. For purposes of this section, the term "services" shall mean the rendering by a vendor through competitive bidding or otherwise, of labor, professional and/or consulting services to the Town, including, but not limited to, the provision of lobbying services to the Town. 
c.  Campaign contributions. The term "campaign contribution" shall have the meaning which is ascribed to the term "contributions" pursuant to F.S.  106.011, as amended. 
(b)  Waiver of prohibition. 
(1)  Criteria for waiver. The requirements of this section may be waived by the affirmative vote of four members of the Town Commission for a particular transaction after a public hearing, upon finding that: 
a.  The goods, equipment or services to be involved in the proposed transaction are unique and the Town cannot avail itself of such goods, equipment or services without entering into a transaction which would violate this section but for waiver of its requirements; or 
b.  The business entity involved in the proposed transaction is the sole source of supply as determined by the Town Manager in accordance with procedures established by the Town Manager; or 
c.  An emergency contract must be made in order to protect the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the Town; or 
d.  A contract for the provision of goods, equipment or services exists which, if terminated by the Town, would be substantially adverse to the best economic interests of the Town. 
(2)  Limited waiver. Notwithstanding the denial of the Town Commission of a waiver request regarding the provision of goods, equipment or services under an existing contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) above, the Town Commission may, by the affirmative vote of four members of the Town Commission after a public hearing, grant a limited waiver concerning an existing contract for the provision of goods, equipment or services between a vendor and the Town upon finding that in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Town, it is necessary that the affected contract be continued for a limited duration (not to exceed a period of six months) in order for the Town to obtain a replacement vendor. 
(3)  Full disclosure. Any grant of a waiver or limited waiver by the Town Commission must first be supported with a full disclosure of the subject campaign contribution. 
(c)  Implementation. The Town Manager is authorized to adopt additional procurement procedures for goods, equipment or services to implement this section. These procedures shall provide for the assembly, maintenance and posting of an official Town vendor list as referenced herein. 
(d)  Campaign contribution limits. No candidate for the office of Mayor or Town Commissioner shall accept a campaign contribution, and no person or entity shall make a campaign contribution to such a candidate, in an amount which exceeds the aggregate amount of $300.00 per election, adjusted for inflation based upon the consumer price index. 
(e)  Penalty. Violations of this section shall be punishable as provided in section 1-12 of this Code. 
(f)  Applicability. This section shall be applied only prospectively to campaign contributions which are made after the date of adoption of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2009-04,  2, 1-27-09) 
Sec. 2-26. - Town Commission code of ethics. 
(a)  Definition. For purposes of this subsection, the term "affiliated" shall mean "being in close formal or informal association." 
(b)  Requirement to abstain from voting. Neither the Mayor nor any Commissioner shall vote on any matter affecting a Town vendor with whom the Mayor or Commissioner is affiliated, whether in a voluntary or paid capacity. This section shall not be interpreted to require that the Mayor or Commission[er] abstain from participation in the matter if they must abstain from voting pursuant to this section. Where a Commissioner or Mayor abstains from voting under this section of [the] Code, within 15 days after the vote occurs, he or she shall file a written disclosure of the nature of his or her affiliation with the Town Clerk, who shall incorporate the written disclosure into the minutes. 
(c)  Effect of abstaining from voting under this section on obligation to vote. F.S.  286.012 prohibits a Commissioner or Mayor from abstaining from voting unless there is, or appears to be, a possible conflict of interest under Florida Statutes. In any situation where a Commissioner or Mayor abstains from voting pursuant to this section of [the] Code, the Commissioner or Mayor shall be deemed to be able to abstain because of the existence or appearance of a possible conflict of interest under the statute. 
(d)  Requirement not to participate in shade sessions. Neither the Mayor nor any Commissioner shall participate in a shade session on any litigation matter involving a party adverse to the Town with whom the Mayor or Commissioner is affiliated, whether in a voluntary or paid capacity. 
(e)  Applicability to related business entities. The restrictions and prohibitions which are imposed by this section upon any Commissioner or Mayor, by virtue of that person's service as a Commissioner or Mayor, shall also be applicable to any business entity in which such Commissioner or Mayor has an employment, independent contractor or material interest. The term "material interest" shall have the meaning indicated by F.S.  112.312. 
(f)  Majority of Town Commission unable to vote or to meet in a shade session. If the application of this provision results in a majority of the Commission being unable to vote or to meet, then the remaining members of the Commission may approve the matter by unanimous vote or participate in the shade session. Alternatively, by unanimous vote of the remaining Commissioners present, the Commission may waive the requirements of this section so that a quorum will be available to meet or to vote, if it finds that such waiver will be consistent with the purposes of this section and will not create or tend to create an appearance of impropriety. 
(g)  Statutory standards of conduct. The Mayor and each Commissioner shall comply with the standards of conduct set forth in Part III of F.S. ch. 112, including but not limited to the regulations and prohibitions therein for solicitation or acceptance of gifts, doing business with or appearing before the Town, unauthorized compensation, misuse of public position, conflicting employment or contractual relationships, disclosure or use of certain information, and lobbying. 
(h)  Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to home rule and to F.S.  112.326, allowing stricter local regulation of ethics. 
(i)  Interpretation. Where terms used in Part III of F.S. ch. 112 are used in this section, they shall be defined and interpreted in a manner similar to how they have been used in that statute. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or diminish any stricter ethical standards in Part III of F.S. ch. 112 or any other part of the Florida Statutes, the Charter, the Code of Ordinances or any applicable federal law.

Sec. 2-136. - Pension plan continued; definitions. 
(a)  Pension plan created and continued. The Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea Volunteer Firefighters' Pension Plan established September 10, 1985, as amended, is created and continued for the purpose of providing retirement income to volunteer firefighter members of the plan, certain former volunteer firefighters and survivor income to joint annuitants and beneficiaries where applicable. The plan is intended to be a tax qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and meet the requirements of a governmental plan as defined by Code Section 414(d). 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accrued benefit means the monthly normal retirement benefit payable commencing at the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he remained in the Volunteer Fire Department. For purposes of computing this normal retirement benefit, the member's credited service as of the date of separation from service shall be used. 
    Actuarial equivalence or actuarially equivalent means that any benefit payable under the terms of this plan in a form other than the normal form of benefit shall have the same actuarial present value on the date payment commences as the normal form of benefit. For purposes of establishing the actuarial present value of any form of payment, other than a lump sum distribution, all future payments shall be discounted for interest and mortality by using seven percent interest and the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table for males, with ages set ahead five years for disability retirees. 
    For plan years beginning after December 31, 2002, for purposes of Code Section 415(b), the mortality table is the table used under Code Section 417(e) as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in Rev. Rul. 2001-62. 
    Average final compensation means the average compensation of the five best years of the last ten best contributing years prior to retirement as a volunteer or change in status to permanent full-time firefighter or the career average of a volunteer firefighter, whichever is greater. 
    Beneficiary means the person entitled to receive benefits upon the death of a member who has been designated in writing by the member and the member has filed such designation with the Board. If no such designation is in effect at the time of death of the member or if no person so designated is living at that time, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the Board of Trustees which shall administer and manage the plan and serve as trustee of the fund. 
    Compensation means a member's total cash remuneration including incentives for firefighter services rendered to Town through the Volunteer Fire Department. Effective for payments made after December 31, 2008, as provided for by Internal Revenue Code Section 414(u)(12), this definition of compensation shall include any differential wage payment from the employer to a member as a result of the member's absence from employment while serving in qualified military service. 
    Effective July 1, 2011, overtime included in compensation is limited to 300 hours per member per year. Prior to July 1, 2011, all overtime is included in the definition of compensation. No hours of unused accumulated sick and vacation leave earned after July 1, 2011, shall be considered compensation, however, members may include all hours earned as of June 30, 2011, provided that amount of hours is cashed in at retirement. 
    Credited service means, for each member, the number of plan years after December 31, 1971, in which the member accumulates at least 30 service credits. One service credit shall be awarded for each of the following services: 
(1)  Attendance at regular business meetings of the Volunteer Fire Department; 
(2)  Attendance at a drill of the Volunteer Fire Department; 
(3)  An approved response to a fire alarm or emergency calls (including false alarms); 
(4)  Station watch for each 12-hour period. 
No credit for benefit eligibility, vesting or computation purposes under the plan shall be allowed for any plan year in which less than 30 service credits are awarded. In no event shall a member be permitted to accumulate more than 30 years of credited service. Further: 
(1)  No member will receive credit for years or fractional parts of years of service if he or she has withdrawn his or her contributions to the fund for those years or fractional parts of years of service, unless the member repays into the fund the amount he or she has withdrawn, plus interest determined by the Board. The member shall have at least 90 days after his or her reemployment to make repayment. 
(2)  A nonvested member may voluntarily leave his or her contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the Volunteer Fire Department, pending the possibility of being rehired, without losing credit for the time he or she has participated actively as a volunteer firefighter. If the firefighter is not reassociated with the Volunteer Department, within five years, his or her contributions shall be returned without interest. Once contributions are returned, all of his or her rights and benefits are forfeited. 
(3)  In determining the creditable service of any member, credit for up to five years of the time spent in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act (USERRA) shall be added to the years of actual service if:

Sec. 2-140. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. Members shall make contributions of five percent of compensation to the plan.

(c)  Town contributions. So long as this plan is in effect, the Town shall make an annual contribution to the fund an amount at least equal to the difference in each year as between the sum of the State contributions and member contributions for the year and the total cost for the year as shown by the most recent actuarial valuation report for the plan. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total of normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial liability in accordance with applicable laws of the State. The Town's contribution shall be deposited on at least a quarterly basis. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis.

(Ord. No. 273,  5, 9-10-85; Ord. No. 280,  1, 3-10-87; Ord. No. 2015-18,  2, 11-11-2015) 
Sec. 2-141. - Change in beneficiary.

(Ord. No. 273,  2(3), 9-10-85; Ord. No. 2015-18,  2, 11-11-2015) 
Sec. 2-142. - Limitation on benefits. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the plan shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this plan. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. 
(1)  If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
(2)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1). 
c.  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
1.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
2.  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
3.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the plan in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the plan, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury regulations. 
d.  Other adjustments in limitations. 
1.  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
2.  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time police officer or firefighter, the adjustments provided for in d.1. above shall not apply. 
3.  The reductions provided for in d.1. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
4.  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his/her delegate. 
(c)  Less than ten years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service shall be the amount determined under section 2-142(a) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this section cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent. The reduction provided for in this section shall not be applicable to disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
(d)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the employer shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all employer defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(e)  Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this plan and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the employer contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the employer has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(f)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the Board and the Plan Administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures to defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the Board and the Plan Administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the Board and the Plan Administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(g)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a participant of the plan and who has not previously participated in such plan, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No participant shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the participant is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or Federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(h)  Section 401(a)(17) limitation on compensation. For any person who first becomes a member in any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1996, compensation for any plan year shall not include any amounts in excess of the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limitation (as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993), which limitation shall be adjusted as required by Federal law for qualified government plans and shall be further adjusted for changes in the cost of living in the manner provided by Internal Revenue Code Section 415(d). For any person who first became a member prior to the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1996, the limitation on compensation shall be not less than the maximum compensation amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the plan as in effect on July 1, 1993, which limitation shall be adjusted for changes in the cost of living since 1989 in the manner provided by Internal Revenue Code Section 415(d).

Sec. 2-143. - Normal and early retirement benefit. 
(a)  Normal retirement. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the pension plan who retires on or after his normal retirement date shall be eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit commencing on his actual retirement date. Effective prospectively from December 1, 2015, the monthly normal retirement benefit shall be increased from $10.00 multiplied by the number of years of credited service to $42.50 multiplied by the number of years of credited service, however, effective for retirements after March 1, 2003, the benefit shall be at least two percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. Effective prospectively from December 1, 2015, the monthly benefit of the current retirees will also be increased to $42.50 per year of service. 
(2)  Form of benefit. The normal retirement benefit shall commence on the member's actual retirement date and be payable on the first day of each month thereafter with the last payment being the one next preceding the retiree's death. If the member dies after retirement but before receiving benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit shall be paid to the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) as designated by the member for the balance of the ten-year period or, if no beneficiary is designated to the estate of the member. 
(3)  Optional forms of benefit. In lieu of the form of benefit described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, a member may choose an optional form of benefit as provided in this division. 
(4)  Vesting. A member shall be 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit upon the earlier of attaining the normal retirement date or completing ten years of service. 
(b)  Early retirement. 
(1)  Eligibility. Any member may retire from the service of the department as of the first day of any calendar month which is prior to the member's normal retirement date but subsequent to the date as of which he or she has both attained the age of 50 and has completed ten years of credited service. 
(2)  Amount. In the event of early retirement, the monthly amount of retirement income payable shall be computed as described in normal retirement, taking into account the firefighter's credited service to his or her date of actual retirement and average final compensation as of such date, such amount of retirement income to be actuarially reduced to take into account the firefighter's younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income benefits. The early retirement reduction shall be three percent for each year by which the member's age at retirement preceded the member's normal retirement date. 
(3)  Form of benefit. The early retirement benefit shall commence on the member's actual retirement date and be payable on the first day of each month thereafter, with the last payment being the one next preceding the retiree's death. If the member dies after retirement but before receiving benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit shall be paid to the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) as designated by the member for the balance of the ten-year period or, if no beneficiary is designated to the estate of the member. 
(4)  Optional forms of benefit. In lieu of the form of benefit just described, a member may choose an optional form of benefit as provided later in the division.

Sec. 2-143.1. - Defined contribution component. 
    Pursuant to the requirements of F.S.  175.351(6), a defined contribution plan component is established in addition to the defined benefit component of this local law plan.

(Ord. No. 2015-18,  2, 11-11-2015) 
Sec. 2-144. - Death benefits. 
(a)  Death prior to retirement. If the death of a member occurs prior to his attaining ten years of credited service, then the member's beneficiary is entitled to a refund of contributions. If a member dies on or after attaining ten years of service but before his actual retirement, a death benefit shall be paid from the fund to his beneficiary for a period of 120 months. The amount of the benefit shall be computed as though the member had retired on his date of death and had chosen a ten-year certain and life annuity. 
(b)  Death subsequent to retirement. For the death of a retiree, death benefits, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the form of benefit chosen at the time of retirement.

Sec. 2-145. - Benefits upon termination. 
    Each member who terminates his membership in the Volunteer Fire Department and who has less than ten years of service and is not eligible for any of the retirement, disability or death benefits set forth in this division shall receive a refund of accumulated contributions from the fund. However, if at the time of his termination of membership the member has ten or more years of credited service, he shall receive his accrued benefit payable commencing at the date which would have been his normal retirement date had he remained a member of the Volunteer Fire Department. If a terminated member with ten or more years of credited service dies before the commencement of his vested retirement benefit, a ten-year certain benefit will be paid to the member's beneficiary beginning at what would have been the member's normal retirement date. 
(Ord. No. 273,  3(4), 9-10-85; Ord. No. 2015-18,  2, 11-11-2015) 
Sec. 2-146. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  Each member entitled to a normal, early, disability, or vested deferred retirement benefit shall have the right at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin to elect to have his benefit payable under any one of the options set forth in this section in lieu of the benefits otherwise provided in this section, and to revoke any such elections and make a new election at any time prior to the actual beginning of payments. The value of optional benefits shall be actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable, and the present value of payments to the retiring member must be at least equal to 50 percent of the total present value of payments to the retiring member and his beneficiary. The member shall make such an election by written request to the Board, such request being retained in the Board's files. 
(1)  Option 1, joint and last survivor option. The member may elect to receive a benefit, which has been adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit, during his lifetime and have such adjusted benefit or a designated fraction thereof (50 percent, 66 2/3 percent, 75 percent, and 100 percent) continued after his death to and during the lifetime of his beneficiary. The election of Option 1 shall be null and void if the designated beneficiary dies before the member's benefit payments commence. However, the estate of the member would be entitled to a benefit, to the extent that the member's contributions, if any had not been repaid. 
(2)  Option 2, ten-year certain and life annuity. The member may elect to receive a benefit, which has been adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit, with 120 monthly payments guaranteed. If the member should die before the 120 monthly payments are made, payments are then continued to his designated beneficiary until 120 payments in all have been made, at which time benefits cease. After expiration of the 120 monthly guaranteed payments, should the retired member be then alive, payments shall be continued during his remaining lifetime. 
(3)  Option 3, single life annuity. The member may elect to receive a retirement benefit, which has been adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit, which will continue during his lifetime and cease upon his death. 
(b)  The firefighter upon electing any option of this section must designate the joint annuitant or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of his or her death, and may change such designation, but any such change shall be deemed a new election and is subject to approval by the Board of Trustees. Such designation must name a joint annuitant or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a firefighter has elected an option with a joint annuitant or beneficiary and his or her retirement income benefits have commenced, the firefighter may change the designated joint annuitant or beneficiary, but only if the Board of Trustees consents to such change and if the joint annuitant last designated by the firefighter is alive when the firefighter files with the Board of Trustees a request for such change. 
(c)  The consent of a firefighter's joint annuitant or beneficiary to any such change is not required. 
(d)  The Board of Trustees may request evidence of the good health of the joint annuitant that is being removed, and the amount of the retirement income payable to the firefighter upon designation of a new joint annuitant shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the age and gender of the former joint annuitant, the new joint annuitant, and the firefighter. Each designation must be made in writing on a form prepared by the Board of Trustees and filed with the Board of Trustees. If no designated beneficiary survives the firefighter, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the firefighter subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid as provided in F.S.  175.181. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, a retired firefighter may change his or her designation of joint annuitant or beneficiary up to two times as provided in F.S.  175.333 without the approval of the Board of Trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree is not required to provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. Any retired member who desires to change his or her joint annuitant or beneficiary shall file with the Board of Trustees a notarized notice of such change. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form or such other notice, the Board of Trustees shall adjust the member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current benefit and there is no impact to the plan. The beneficiary or joint annuitant being removed will be assumed deceased by the actuary in determining the actuarially equivalent amount of the revised monthly payment. No retiree's current benefit shall be increased as a result of the change of beneficiary. 
(f)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a firefighter dies prior to his or her normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under F.S.  175.201. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary or joint annuitant dies before the firefighter's retirement under the plan, the option elected is cancelled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount is payable to the firefighter upon retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the firefighter before retirement and within 90 days after the death of the beneficiary. 
(3)  If both the retired firefighter and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by him or her die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Board of Trustees may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with F.S.  175.181. 
(4)  If a firefighter continues beyond his or her normal retirement date and dies prior to actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the firefighter in the amount or amounts computed as if the firefighter had retired under the option on the date on which death occurred. 
(g)  No firefighter may make any change in his or her retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing the first retirement check. 
(Ord. No. 273,  4, 9-10-85; Ord. No. 2015-18,  2, 11-11-2015) 
Sec. 2-147. - Disability retirement. 
(a)  Definition of disability. For purposes of this pension plan, total and permanent disability shall mean an injury, disease or condition, which permanently incapacitates a member, either physically or mentally, from his regular and continuous duty as a firefighter. A total and permanent disability arising directly from the performance of service to the Town by a member as a firefighter shall be considered to be a duty disability. A total and permanent disability arising from any other cause or source shall be considered non-duty disability. 
    Any condition or impairment of health of a firefighter caused by tuberculosis, hypertension, heart disease, hepatitis, or meningococcal meningitis resulting in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have been accidental and suffered in the line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such firefighter shall have successfully passed a physical examination before entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition. In order to be entitled to the presumption in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, the member must meet the requirements of F.S.  112.181. 
(b)  Exclusions. A member shall not be entitled to receive a disability retirement benefit from the plan if the disability is a result of: 
(1)  Excessive and habitual use of drugs, intoxicants and narcotics; 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while committing a crime; 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while serving in any of the Armed Forces. This exclusion does not affect members who have become disabled as a result of intervening military service under the Federal Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 (H.R. 6081; P.L. 110-245); 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment with the Town has been terminated; 
(5)  Any condition evidenced during the member's preemployment physical. 
(c)  Application for benefits. In order for the Board to consider a member's request for disability retirement benefits, the member must apply in writing to the Board. This application must be made as soon as is practicable following the date when the disability condition arose. Unless extenuating circumstances can be proven to the satisfaction of the Board, an application dated more than six months following the date when the disability condition arose or first became evident shall be grounds for the denial of the application by the Board. Upon receipt of proper application by the Board, the Board shall arrange for a physical examination of the applicant by the Medical Board. 
(d)  Medical Board. When a member submits proper application for a disability retirement benefit, the Board shall designate a Medical Board to be composed of at least one but not more than three physicians. The choice of physicians shall be made in accordance with the condition or conditions for which the member is applying for disability retirement. The Medical Board shall arrange for and pass upon all medical examinations required under the provisions of this plan, shall investigate all essential statements or certificates made by or on behalf of a member in connection with an application for disability retirement and shall report in writing to the Board its conclusions and recommendations upon all matters referred to it. The payment for such services shall be determined by the Board. 
(e)  Determination of disability. All questions relating to eligibility for initial payment or continuance of disability benefits shall be determined by the Board, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Medical Board and such other evidence of which the Board may avail itself. The general steps which the Board shall follow in its determination shall be as follows; provided, however, that the Board may in its discretion alter or modify these steps: 
(1)  Determine whether the member's application is proper and timely; 
(2)  Based on all evidence submitted to the Board, determine whether applicant satisfies the definition of disability, including the listed exclusions; 
(3)  Establish a date of disability which may be the date of injury causing the disability, the date when the member could no longer perform his regular and continuous duties or such other date as determined by the Board. 
(f)  Benefits. 
(1)  Eligibility. All members are eligible for duty disability benefits, regardless of their length of credit service. Each member who completes ten years of credited service prior to becoming disabled shall be eligible for non-duty disability benefits. 
(2)  Amount of disability benefit. Effective prospectively from December 1, 2015, the monthly disability retirement benefit shall be increased from $10.00 multiplied by the number of the member's years of credited service to $42.50 multiplied by the number of years of credited service, however, the benefit shall be at least two percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. 
(3)  Term of payments. Disability benefits shall commence on or as of the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date of disability, as established by the Board, and shall continue to be paid on the first day of each subsequent month until the death or recovery of the disability retiree. If the firefighter dies without recovering from the disability, the last payment will be the payment due next preceding his or her death or the 120th monthly payment whichever is later. In lieu of the form of benefit payment as provided in this paragraph, a firefighter may select an optional form of benefit as provided in section 2-146. 
(4)  Eligibility for other benefits. If a member applying for disability benefits is also eligible for normal retirement, the normal retirement benefit shall be payable instead of a disability retirement benefit. 
(g)  Authority for reexamination. Each person who first qualifies for disability retirement benefits on or after September 10, 1985, shall be subject to periodic reexamination by a Medical Board selected by the Board of Trustees to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. Such reexaminations shall not be permitted more often than twice in any calendar year. 
(h)  Recovery from disability. If a member who has been retired on a disability benefit regains his health and is able to perform his duties in the Volunteer Fire Department, the Board shall discontinue the pension. If such member shall resume his employment with the Town as a firefighter, then he shall receive credited service for the period of such disability retirement. In addition, such member shall retain credit for the period of credited service prior to the date of disability.

(e)  The Board of Trustees shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1)  The Board of Trustees shall be vested with full legal title to the fund; subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Town Commission to amend or terminate this trust, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this plan. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the Board or its agent in the fund and the Board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(2)  The fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities or property, real or personal, wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the Board of Trustees, including but not limited to stocks, common or preferred, and bonds and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership.

(5)  The fund may be invested in a common or collective trust fund or pooled investment fund maintained by a bank or trust company or a pooled investment fund of an insurance company qualified to do business in the State even though such bank, trust company or insurance company is a custodian or investment advisor with respect to the plan, provided such bank, trust company or insurance company receives not more than reasonable compensation. 
(6)  No person shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except due to his own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(7)  The Board shall cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of the custodian's nominee as it may direct or the custodian may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the trust fund. 
(8)  The Board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds or securities of any corporation, association or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee or with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and, generally, to exercise any of the powers of the owner with respect to stocks, bonds or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(9)  The Board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained in this division. 
(10)  Where any action which the Board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform, either under the terms of this division or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this division, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the Town or any other entity of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the Board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(11)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the Board so that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayment shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction. Underpayments shall be made up from the trust fund. 
(12)  The Board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for in this division. 
(13)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the Town and the Board shall be necessary parties, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice of service or process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(14)  a.  At least once every three years, the Board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant who shall evaluate the performance of any existing professional money manager and shall make recommendations to the Board of Trustees regarding the selection of money managers for the next investment term.

The divestiture of any such security must be completed by September 30, 2010. The Board and its named officers or investment advisors may not be deemed to have breached their fiduciary duty in any action taken to dispose of any such security, and the Board shall have satisfactorily discharged the fiduciary duties of loyalty, prudence, and sole and exclusive benefit to the participants of the pension fund and their beneficiaries if the actions it takes are consistent with the duties imposed by F.S.  215.473, and the manner of the disposition, if any, is reasonable as to the means chosen. For the purposes of effecting compliance with that section, the pension fund shall designate terror-free plans that allocate their funds among securities not subject to divestiture. No person may bring any civil, criminal, or administrative action against the Board of Trustees or any employee, officer, director, or advisor of such pension fund based upon the divestiture of any security pursuant to this subsection.

Sec. 2-149. - Distribution of benefits. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan to the contrary, a form of retirement income payable from this plan after the effective date of this division, shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirements of Section 1.401(a)(9)-2 Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) to satisfy the following conditions:

b.  Shall be paid over the period extending not beyond the life expectancy of the member and spouse or dependent.

(2)  If the member's death occurs before the distribution of his/her interest in the plan has commenced, the member's entire interest in the plan shall be distributed within five years of the member's death, unless it is to be distributed in accordance with the following rules: 
a.  The member's remaining interest in the plan is payable to his/her spouse or dependent; 
b.  The remaining interest is to be distributed over the life of the spouse, issue or dependent or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the spouse, or dependent; and

Such distribution begins within one year of the member's death unless the member's spouse, issue or dependent shall receive the remaining interest in which case the distribution need not begin before the date on which the member would have attained age 701/2 and if the spouse, issue or dependent dies before the distribution to the spouse, issue or dependent begins, this section shall be applied as if the spouse, issue or dependent were the plan member. 
(b)  Should the participant be subject to an involuntary mandatory distribution of a nonforfeitable account balance that is under $5,001.00 but is more than $1,000.00, then the assets shall be rolled over to an individual retirement plan of a designated trustee or issuer. If the present value of a vested benefit exceeds $5,000.00, then the benefit may only be paid out with the participant's consent.

Sec. 2-151. - Minors and incompetents. 
    If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgment of the Board, otherwise incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due him under the plan, the Board may, unless and until claims shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian or committee of such person, make such payment or any part thereof to such person's spouse, children or other person deemed by the Board to have incurred expenses or assumed responsibility for the expenses of such person.

The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The Board of Trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The Board shall inform the Town if additional assets are required, in which event the Town shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The Board of Trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each member, retiree, or vested former member (collectively referred to in this section as "volunteer firefighter") entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The Board of Trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the volunteer firefighters' accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the volunteer firefighter. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the Town, less return to the State of the State's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the Town and the State to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the Town and the State. 
(5)  The Board of Trustees shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3).

Sec. 2-153. - Nonassignability. 
    No pension benefit provided for in this division shall be assignable or subject to garnishment for debt or for other legal process. However, the Board shall honor an income deduction order for alimony or child support in accordance with rules and procedures adopted by the Board. 
    Upon written request by the retiree, the Board of Trustees may authorize the Plan Administrator to withhold from the monthly retirement payment funds necessary to: 
(1)  Pay for benefits being received through the Town; 
(2)  Pay the certified bargaining agent; or 
(3)  Pay for premiums for accident health and long-term care insurance for the retiree, the retiree's spouse and dependents. A retirement plan does not incur liability for participation in this permissive program if its actions are taken in good faith pursuant to F.S.  175.061(7).

The Commission has made the following findings in reaching the determination that sleeping on the Town's beaches during nighttime hours must be prohibited: 
(1)  That the Town's beaches are its most valuable natural asset; 
(2)  That the Town's beaches are intended to be used solely for recreational purposes and are not intended to be used for sleeping during nighttime hours; 
(3)  That the Town's economic well-being is substantially dependent upon tourism which is, in turn, dependent upon maintaining attractive and inviting beaches; 
(4)  That permitting persons to sleep upon the Town's beaches during nighttime hours will negatively affect the appearance of the Town's beaches, will have a deleterious effect upon the Town's tourism industry and will require the unwarranted expenditure of Town funds in order to provide a reasonably safe and healthy sleeping environment for those who may choose to sleep upon the Town's beaches during nighttime hours; 
(5)  That persons asleep on Town beaches during nighttime hours are exposed to the risk of harm from others or from the elements; and

ARTICLE IV. - COASTAL CONSTRUCTION CODE[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Cross reference- Buildings and building regulations, Ch. 6; flood prevention and control, Ch. 9; land development Ch. 24. 

Sec. 5-76. - Title. 
    The provisions contained in this article shall constitute the Coastal Construction Code for construction within the coastal building zone and coastal barrier islands in the Town and shall be referred to as the Coastal Code. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-77. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-05,  2, adopted July 9, 2014, repealed  5-77, which pertained to definitions and derived from Ord. No. 279,  1, adopted Feb. 10, 1987. 
Sec. 5-78. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Coastal Code is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes and other severe storms occurring along the coastal area of the Town which fronts on the Atlantic Ocean. These standards are intended to specifically address the design features which affect the structural stability of the beach, dunes and topography of adjacent properties. The coastal cost [code] is site-specific to the coastal building zone and is not applicable to other locations. If a conflict arises between this article and other provisions of this Code, the requirements resulting in the more restrictive design shall apply. No provision in this article shall be construed to permit any construction in any area prohibited by local, County, State or Federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-79. - Applicability. 
    Construction within the coastal building zone shall meet the requirements of this article. All structures shall be designed so as to minimize damage to life, property and the natural environment. Assistance in determining the design parameters to minimize such damage may be found in the reference documents listed in section 5-88. The requirements of this Coastal Code shall apply to the following types of construction in the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands in the Town: 
(1)  The new construction of or improvement to major structures, nonhabitable major structures and minor structures; 
(2)  Construction which would change or otherwise have the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones, i.e., excavation, grading, paving; 
(3)  Construction located partially within the coastal building zone; 
(4)  Reconstruction, redevelopment or repair of a damaged structure from any cause which meets the definition of substantial improvement. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-80. - Exceptions. 
    The requirements of the Coastal Code shall not apply to the following: 
(1)  Minor work in the nature of normal beach cleaning and debris removal; 
(2)  Structures in existence prior to the effective date of this Coastal Code, except for substantial improvements; 
(3)  Construction for which a valid and unexpired building permit was issued prior to the effective date of this Coastal Code; 
(4)  Construction extending seaward of the seasonal high waterline which is regulated by the provisions of F.S.  162.041, i.e., groins, jetties, moles, break-waters, seawalls, piers, revetments, beach nourishment, inlet dredging, etc.; 
(5)  Construction of nonhabitable major structures except for the requirements of section 5-84; 
(6)  Construction of minor structures except for the requirements of section 5-85; 
(7)  Structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places; 
(8)  Construction for improvement of a major structure to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are necessary to ensure safe living conditions. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-81. - Applications for building permits. 
    Applications for building permits for construction in the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands, if not of normal or usual design, may be required by the Building Official to be certified by an architect or professional engineer registered in the State. Such certification shall state that the design plans and specifications for the construction are in compliance with the criteria established by this Coastal Code. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-82. - Design conditions. 
(a)  Velocity pressure. Major structures, except mobile homes, shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of section 1205 of the 1986 revisions of the 1985 Standard Building Code, published by the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc., using a minimum fastest-mile wind velocity of 110 miles per hour. These minimum design pressures are as follows: 
Table 1205.2A 
Velocity pressure (psf) 
Building height 60 feet or less 
Mean roof height (ft.) Fastest-mile wind 
velocity V (mph) 110 0-15 25 20 28 40 34 60 38  
Table 1205.3A 
Gust velocity pressure 
Building height greater than 60 feet

(b)  Foundations. The elevation of the soil surface to be used in the design of foundations, calculation of pile reactions and bearing capacities shall not be greater than that which would result from soil erosion reasonably anticipated as a result of storm conditions. Foundation design and construction of a major structure shall consider all anticipated loads acting simultaneously with live and dead loads. Erosion computations for foundation design shall account for all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces, including localized scour due to the presence of structural components. Foundation design and construction shall provide for adequate bearing capacity taking into consideration the type of soil present and the anticipated loss of soil above the design grade as a result of localized scour. Erosion computations are not required landward of coastal construction control lines established or updated since June 30, 1980. Upon request, the department of natural resources may provide information as to those areas within coastal building zones where erosion and scour of a 100-year storm event is applicable. 
(c)  Wave forces. Calculations for wave forces resulting from design storm conditions on building foundations and superstructures may be based upon the minimum criteria and methods prescribed in the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Design Manual, NAVFAC DM-26, U.S. Department of the Navy; Shore Protection Manual, U.S. Department of the Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Department of the Army Coastal Engineering Research Center Technical Papers and Reports; the technical and design memoranda of the Division of Beaches and Shores, Florida Department of Natural Resources; or other professionally recognized methodologies which produce equivalent design criteria. Breaking, broken and nonbreaking waves shall be considered as applicable. Design wave loading analysis shall consider vertical uplift pressures and all lateral pressures to include impact as well as dynamic loading and the harmonic intensification resulting from repetitive waves. 
(d)  Hydrostatic loads. Calculations for hydrostatic loads shall consider the maximum water pressure resulting from a fully peaked, breaking wave superimposed upon the design storm surge with dynamic wave setup. Both free and hydrostatic loads shall be considered. Hydrostatic loads which are confined shall be determined by using the maximum elevation to which the confined water would freely rise if unconfined. Vertical hydrostatic loads shall be considered both upward and downward on horizontal or inclined surfaces of major structures, i.e., floors, slabs, roofs, walls. Lateral hydrostatic loads shall be considered as forces acting horizontally above and below grade on vertical or inclined surfaces. Hydrostatic loads on irregular or curved geometric surfaces shall be determined by considering the separate vertical and horizontal component acting simultaneously under the distribution of the hydrostatic pressures. 
(e)  Hydrodynamic loads. Hydrodynamic loads shall consider the maximum water pressures resulting from the motion of the water mass associated with the design storm. Full intensity loading shall be applied on all structural surfaces above the design grade which would affect the design velocities. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-83. - Structural requirements for major structures. 
(a)  Design and construction. Major structures, except for mobile homes, shall be designed and constructed in accordance with section 1205 of the 1986 revisions to the 1985 edition of the Standard Building Code, published by the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc., using a fastest-wind velocity of 110 miles per hour. Major structures, except mobile homes, shall also comply with the applicable standards for construction found elsewhere in the South Florida Building Code. 
(b)  Mobile homes. Mobile homes shall conform to the Federal Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards or the Uniform Standards Code ANSI A-119.1 pursuant to F.S.  320.823 as well as the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  Elevation, floodproofing and siting. All major structures shall be designed, constructed and located in compliance with the National Flood Insurance Regulations as found in 44 CFR, Parts 59 and 60 or chapter 9 of this Code, whichever is more restrictive. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-84. - Structural requirements for nonhabitable major structures. 
    Nonhabitable major structures need not meet the specific structural requirements of section 5-83 except that they shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach and dune system and shall comply with the applicable standards of construction found in the South Florida Building Code. All sewage treatment and public water systems shall be floodproofed to prevent infiltration of surface water anticipated under design storm conditions. Underground utilities, excluding pad transformers and vaults, shall be floodproofed to prevent infiltration of surface water expected under design storm conditions or shall otherwise be designed to function when submerged under such storm conditions. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-85. - Structural requirements for minor structures. 
    Minor structures need not meet the specific structural requirements of section 5-83 except that they shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach and dune system and shall comply with the applicable standards of construction found in the South Florida Building Code. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-86. - Location of construction. 
    Construction, except for walkways, lifeguard support stands, piers, beach access ramps, gazebos and coastal or shore protection structures, shall be located a sufficient distance landward of the beach to permit natural shoreline fluctuations and to preserve dune stability. Construction, including excavation, may occur to the extent that the natural storm buffering and protection capability of the dune is not diminished. 
(Ord. No. 279,  1, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 5-87. - Public access. 
    Where the public has established an accessway through private lands to lands seaward of mean high tide or waterline by prescription, prescriptive easement or other legal means, development or construction shall not interfere with such right of access unless a comparable alternative accessway is provided. The developer shall have the right to improve, consolidate or relocate such accessways so long as they are: 
(1)  Of substantially similar quality and convenience to the public; 
(2)  Approved by the Town and approved by the Department of Natural Resources whenever improvements are involved seaward of the coastal construction line; and 
(3)  Consistent with the coastal management element of the local comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to F.S.  163.3178.

(Ord. No. 466,  1, 2, 3-27-01) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 466,  1, 2, adopted March 27, 2001, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of its provisions as  8-101.1 herein was at the discretion of the editor. 
Sec. 8-102. - Intent of fire protection special assessment. 
    It is the intent of this article to provide a methodology for the fair and reasonable levy and collection of a special assessment to fund the provision of fire protection services by the Town within one or both of the fire protection special assessment areas described in section 8-101, as prescribed in the initial, preliminary, and annual assessment resolutions. The Town intends to utilize the uniform method for the levy and collection of special assessments, provided in F.S.  197.3632 and 197.3635, as amended from time to time, as those provisions set forth a fair and reasonable procedure to levy and collect special assessments that ensures proper notice and adequate due process to affected parties, and provides for the cooperation between the Town and other governmental entities toward the collection and use of data, providing notice to affected parties, and ensuring the collection of proceeds for use by the Town. It is not the intent of the Town to create any additional due process rights other than those set forth in F.S.  197.3632 and 197.3635. To the extent any provisions herein conflict with those statutory provisions, the aforementioned statutes shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 477,  2, 7-10-01) 
Sec. 8-103. - Findings of special benefit. 
    The Town specifically finds that the provision of fire protection service by the Town provides the requisite special benefit to real property within the Town to justify the funding of fire protection services through a special assessment, as the provision of fire protection services possesses a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of real property by: 
(1)  Protecting the value of improvements and structures upon real property; 
(2)  Lowering the cost of insurance upon real property, including but not limited to fire insurance; 
(3)  Protecting the public safety; and 
(4)  Enhancing the value of real property, both commercial and residential through the provisions of fire protection services. 
(Ord. No. 477,  2, 7-10-01) 
Sec. 8-104. - Authority for fire protection special assessments. 
(a)  Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and F.S.  166.021 and 166.041, the Town Commission has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions and to render municipal services in a manner not inconsistent with law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of municipal ordinances. The Town Commission of the Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea is authorized to fund all or any portion of the costs of providing fire protection services within the Town by imposing an annual fire protection special assessment upon benefitted real property within the Town based upon the special benefit received by such property from the provision of such service. 
(b)  The Town Commission shall impose the fire protection assessment pursuant to the procedures set forth herein. 
(c)  The amount of the fire protection assessment imposed upon a particular parcel of real property within the Town shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the assessed costs of providing fire protection services among the specially benefitted properties. Such methodology shall be set forth by separate resolution duly adopted by the Town Commission as provided herein. 
(d)  This article authorizes the Town Commission to levy a special assessment to fund fire protection services in either or both fire protection special assessment areas as described in section 8-101. The Town Commission shall levy a fire protection special assessment in Area-North, Area-South, or both through the adoption of the initial resolutions and subsequent preliminary and annual assessment resolutions for the area or areas in which the special assessment is levied. 
(e)  No fire protection assessment shall be imposed upon governmental or institutional properties whose uses are wholly exempt from ad valorem taxation under Florida law, as those uses provide services and benefits to the public and the Town which might otherwise need to be provided and funded by the Town. The Town Commission finds that the benefits derived by the Town and its residents from such uses provide a benefit to the Town that are no less than the benefits these properties receive from the provision of fire protection services by the Town. Hence, it is fair and reasonable not to impose the fire protection assessment upon governmental or institutional properties whose uses are wholly exempt from ad valorem taxation.

If imposed, the amount of the partial year assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be 1/12 of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual assessment resolution for the calendar year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the calendar year. If imposed, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the partial year assessment is received by the Town. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the partial year assessment, shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such partial year assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, County, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

Sec. 8-116. - Irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any special assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the special assessment where the assessment roll has been confirmed by the Town by adoption of the assessment resolution. The assessment roll as finally approved and confirmed shall be competent and sufficient evidence that the assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to the adoption of the assessment roll were duly had, taken and performed as required by this article, and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was clearly and materially injured thereby. 
(Ord. No. 477,  2, 7-10-01) 
Sec. 8-117. - Revisions, corrections, omissions. 
(a)  The Town Commission shall be authorized to revise and correct errors and omissions in the assessment roll if: 
(1)  Any fire protection special assessment, or portion thereof, made under this article is annulled, vacated, or set aside, in whole or in part, by the judgment of any court. In such a case, the Town Commission may revise the assessment to comport with the guidelines of any such judgment until such time as a valid assessment is imposed; 
(2)  The Town Commission is satisfied that any assessment is so defective that it can not be enforced or collected; 
(3)  The Town Commission has omitted any property from the assessment roll which should have been assessed for fire protection services. 
(b)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the Tax Collector, the Town Commission shall be authorized to reclassify any property subject to the fire protection assessment based upon competent substantial evidence, or to correct any error in applying the fire protection assessment upon any particular parcel, either on its own initiative or upon receipt of a timely filed written petition by a property owner. 
(c)  No error or omission by the Town Commission, Mayor or any of his or her designees, Town Administrator, Property Appraiser, Tax Collector, or their deputies or employees, or any other officer or agent of Town shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire protection assessment imposed by the Town Commission under the provisions of this article. 
(d)  When it shall appear that any fire protection assessment should have been imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefitted by the provision of fire protection services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll; or such property was erroneously assessed; or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the Town Commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section 8-109(a), impose the applicable fire protection assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is discovered, in addition to the applicable fire protection assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. Such fire protection assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, County, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in section 8-114 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(Ord. No. 477,  2, 7-10-01) 
Sec. 8-118. - Alternate method. 
(a)  This article shall be deemed to provide an alternative method for imposing the fire protection services special assessment, and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing or which may hereafter come into existence. This article shall be construed liberally to effect its purposes. Nothing herein shall preclude the Town Commission from directing or authorizing, by resolution, any additional notices it deems proper, necessary, or convenient to the Town. 
(b)  Should the Town determine in the future to levy a fire protection special assessment on governmental properties, the Town shall develop a method of billing and collection of such separate from the uniform method.

(Ord. No. 2014-03,  2, 6-24-2014) 
Sec. 9-2. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development.

Sec. 9-3. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(a)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(b)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(c)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(d)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(f)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(g)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and

    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter.

The violator's conduct must be such as to demonstrate a specific intent to induce, entice, solicit or procure another to commit an act of prostitution.

    The following words, terms, and phrases when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Knowledge or knowledge of such nuisance means having knowledge of the contents and character or the patently offensive sexual conduct, which appears in the lewd matter. 
    Lewd matter means matter: 
(1)  Which the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, when considered as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; and

Nothing herein contained is intended to preclude or prescribe any matter which, when considered as a whole and in the context in which it is used, possesses serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. However, in light of United States Supreme Court decisions charging each community with the responsibility for setting its own criteria for determining lewd or obscene matter, the foregoing activities are not meant to constitute an exclusive list of those activities which may be considered obscene by some member of the community of the Town through its Town Commission and, thus, do not constitute an agreed community standard of lewdness of obscenity within the Town.

Sec. 14-72. - Purpose; policy; authority; application.

Accordingly, the Town Commission hereby declares such activities to be public nuisances, and herein establishes procedures for the abatement thereof and for the assessment and collection of costs of abatement which may be incurred by the Town incident to such abatement.

It can also impact access to and egress from businesses. 
    Cognizant that street performers are engaged in First Amendment activities, this article imposes reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on street performers to the extent necessary to ensure the safety of performers, their audience, and the general public and to prevent unreasonable interference with residents' enjoyment of peace and quiet in their homes or the ability of businesses to operate and conduct their business.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 18-61. - Fiscal year. 
    The Town hereby establishes a fiscal year beginning October 1 and ending September 30. 
State Law reference- Fiscal year, F.S.  166.241, 218.33. 
Sec. 18-62. - Municipal accounting procedures. 
(a)  Budget. An annual budget shall be adopted, and the accounting system shall provide budgetary control over the revenue and expenditures of the Town. The preparation of the budget by the Town Manager shall include all requirements of the various functions and activities of the Town. The annual budget shall be presented to the Town Commission for its consideration, possible revisions and final adoption. 
(b)  Fund accounting. The Town's accounting system shall be organized and operated on a fund basis. The diverse nature of municipal operations precludes a single, unified set of accounts for recording and summarizing all of the financial transactions. Instead, the required accounts are recognized on the basis of the various funds applicable in the circumstances, each of which should be completed independent of any other fund. Each fund must be so accounted for that the identity of its assets, liabilities, reserves, fund balances, revenues and expenditures is continually maintained. These purposes can be accomplished by providing a complete self-balancing set of accounts for each fund. 
(c)  Number of funds. The administrative and fiscal requirements, and the scope and nature of activities shall govern the number of specific special funds which the Town establishes. In addition, a general fund shall be established to account for all financial transactions not properly accounted for in a specific fund. 
(d)  Fund accounts. A complete self-balancing group of accounts shall be established and maintained for each fund. The group of accounts shall include all general ledger accounts and subsidiary records necessary to reflect compliance with legal provisions, and to set forth the financial position and the results of operations of the respective funds. 
(e)  Accounting records. 
(1)  The accounting records maintained by the Town shall consist of the following: 
a.  General ledger. 
b.  General journal. 
c.  Cash receipts and disbursements register. 
d.  Receipts for cash collections (in duplicate). 
e.  File containing paid vendors' invoices. 
f.  Employees' earnings record. 
g.  Cancelled checks and bank statements. 
h.  Social Security tax returns. 
(2)  The ledgers and journal shall be posted monthly and financial statements showing assets receipts, uncollected receipts, expenditures and unexpended expenses shall be prepared and presented to the Commission monthly. 
(3)  Bank accounts shall be reconciled on a monthly basis. 
(4)  All funds shall be receipted for and deposited daily in the bank chosen as the depository for the particular fund. 
(5)  All disbursements shall be made by check upon proper approval as prescribed in the Charter. 
(6)  All accounting records shall be maintained in an accurate manner for the Auditor. 
(f)  Valuation of fixed assets. The fixed assets accounts shall be maintained on: 
(1)  The basis of original cost; 
(2)  The estimated cost if the original cost is not available; or 
(3)  In the case of gifts, the appraised value at the time received. 
Cost shall include purchase price or construction cost, plus any additional charges necessary to place the asset in operation. 
Depreciation on general fixed assets shall not be recorded in the general accounting records. 
(g)  Basis of accounting. The modified accrual basis of accounting is recommended for the general fund and specific special funds. This basis is briefly defined as that method in which expenditures are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, and revenues are recorded when received in cash. However, for small municipalities the cash basis of accounting may be considered to be acceptable. If deemed so by the Certified Public Accountant auditing the Town's financial records, the cash basis of accounting is acceptable for the Town. 
(h)  Classification of accounts. The chart of accounts for revenues shall be classified by fund and source, and the expenditures by fund, function, activity and character. The accounts shall be arranged in such a manner as to meet the requirements of the Town. A common terminology and classification shall be used consistently throughout the budget, the accounts, and the financial reports so as to simplify their preparation. 
(i)  Financial reporting. Financial statements and reports showing the current position of the accounts shall be prepared periodically (preferably monthly) so as to facilitate control of financial operations. At the close of each fiscal year, a comprehensive annual report covering all funds and financial operations of the Town shall be prepared and published. 
(j)  Internal accounting control. The following procedures shall be followed to provide a measure of control over the financial transactions and accounting matters: 
(1)  The careful review of periodic financial statements by an executive who is familiar with the affairs of the Town; and 
(2)  The requirement that all checks be signed by two authorized check signers. 
(Code 1962,  2-6) 
Sec. 18-63. - Annual financial report. 
(a)  The Town Manager shall, in sufficient time to allow compliance with State law, submit to the Town Commission an annual report covering the fiscal year then ending. In making such report, the Town Manager shall estimate receipts and disbursements based on information in his possession. He shall make an estimate of the expenditures and revenues of the Town for the ensuing year. This estimate shall be compiled from detailed information, and its arrangement and classification of expenditures shall be as nearly uniform as possible for the main functional divisions and departments of the Town and shall give in parallel columns the following information: 
(1)  A detailed estimate of the expense of conducting each department and division of the Town government, including all public utilities, facilities and enterprises conducted by the Town; 
(2)  Expenditures for corresponding items during the two fiscal years last past; 
(3)  The amount of supplies and materials on hand; 
(4)  The increase or decrease of demands for the ensuing year as compared with the corresponding appropriation for the last fiscal year; 
(5)  Such other information as required by the Town Commission or as the Town Manager may deem advisable to submit; 
(6)  Estimates of revenues to be derived from sources other than ad valorem levies. 
(b)  The estimates so given constituting the recommendation of the Town Manager as to the amounts necessary to be appropriated for the fiscal year shall be supported with information giving the reasons therefor in such detail as may be necessary to afford the Town Commission a comprehensive understanding of the needs and requirements of the various divisions of the Town government for the ensuing period. Sufficient copies of the annual report and estimate of the Town Manager shall be prepared that there may be copies on file in the Office of the Finance Director for inspection by the public.

    As soon as practicable after the receipt of the annual financial report and estimate of the Town Manager, the Town Commission shall meet and carefully consider the report. The Town Commission shall determine and fix the amount necessary to carry on the government of the Town for the ensuing year and adopt a budget pursuant to State law setting forth the amounts necessary to be raised for the various departments of the Town. The Town Commission shall appropriate such amounts to the various departments and shall determine the amount of applicable funds on hand, the estimated departmental revenues and the amount of millage necessary to be levied. The budget and millage shall be adopted pursuant to State law.

Contracts and legal instruments in excess of $50,000.00 shall be executed by the Finance Director, and the Town Manager and countersigned by the Mayor-Commissioner or Acting Mayor-Commissioner.

State Law reference- Supplemental method of making local improvements, F.S. ch. 170. 

Sec. 18-101. - Authorized. 
    The Town Commission shall have power and authority to cause local improvements to be constructed, wholly or in part, at the cost of the property owners benefited by such improvements by levying and collecting special assessments for the following improvements: 
(1)  Extending, replacing, enlarging, improving or maintaining the sanitary sewer system by constructing additional sanitary sewerage mains, pumping stations, laterals, storm sewers and other drains and sewers and necessary appurtenances thereto; 
(2)  Extending the waterworks system into new territory by the construction of additional water mains, pumps, etc., and the laying or relaying of mains, pumps, etc., together with the necessary appurtenances thereto, either inside or outside of the corporate limits or partly inside and partly outside; 
(3)  To pave, repave, grade, regrade, macadamize, hard surface, improve, lay out, open, widen, close, curb, extend, demolish, rebuild and otherwise improve streets, alleys, boulevard, avenues, lanes or sidewalks, including any bridges, culverts, fills, grades or other appurtenances which may constitute or form a part of such improvements, or any parts, promenades, piers, wharves, docks or seawalls adjacent or contiguous thereto; to build, demolish, rebuild or otherwise improve any bridges, grades, fills, culverts and appurtenances; and any one or more of such purposes may be combined in the same improvement;

(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  1) 
Sec. 18-102. - Certificates of indebtedness or revenue certificates. 
    For the purpose of obtaining the money to make such improvements mentioned under subsections (1) and (2) of section 18-101 of this article, the Town shall have the power to issue certificates of indebtedness or revenue bonds or certificates, payable solely from the income derived from the operation of such utility or, where utilities are operated jointly or supplement each other, from the revenue derived from the operation of both utilities or of either utility. Property specially benefited by the extension of the sewerage system or the waterworks system or both may be specially assessed for the cost of such extension, enlargement or improvement, either wholly or in part, by the levying of special assessment liens, it being recognized as a power of the Town in its proprietary capacity to levy special assessments against property specially benefited by the extension of a sanitary sewerage system or waterworks system or both in order to repay moneys obtained by the issuance of revenue bonds or certificates. The moneys collected from such special assessment liens shall be used to pay off and discharge any certificates of indebtedness, revenue bonds or certificates issued to obtain money with which to make such improvements. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  2) 
Sec. 18-103. - Resolution of necessity; hearing. 
    Whenever the Town Commission shall determine that it is wise and expedient to make any of the local improvements specified in this article, the cost of which, or any part thereof, is to be assessed against property benefited, it shall adopt a resolution declaring a necessity for the proposed improvements, describing the nature and extent of the work, the general character of materials to be used, a general description of such improvements, the estimated cost of the improvements and the location or area in which such improvements are to be made. The resolution shall fix a date when the Town Commission shall meet which shall not be less than 12 days after the date of the first publication of the notice provided for in this section for the purpose of hearing any objections or remonstrances that may be made to the improvements. Notice of the hearing upon such resolution shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks, the first publication to be not less than 12 days prior to the date fixed for the hearing, which notice shall embrace substantially all the matters required to be set forth in the resolution of necessity. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each property owner affected. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  3) 
Sec. 18-104. - Bids on public improvements. 
    As soon as the Town Commission shall have adopted the resolution of necessity as to the local improvement, or at a later date if it so desires, in cases where the improvement is not to be made by regular Town employees, the Commission shall advertise for bids by publication in two issues in the official newspaper before the date of hearing upon the question of proceeding with the improvement, but such publications shall not be less than seven days apart, and the last publication must not be less than two days before the date of hearing. If at the hearing the Town Commission shall determine to proceed with the improvement, it shall let the contract for such improvement to the lowest and best responsible bidder, but the Commission shall have the right to change or modify the improvement if it desires at the time of adopting a resolution determining to proceed, in which event it can direct all bidders to submit new bids within five days without further advertising. When a bid is accepted, the contractor shall not proceed with the work for a period of ten days. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  4) 
Sec. 18-105. - Cost of the improvement. 
    The Town Commission shall have the power to pay out of its general fund, or out of any special fund that may be provided for the purpose, such portion of the cost of the proposed improvement as it may deem to be the proper portion to be borne by the Town. Interest accrued while an improvement is under construction and for six months thereafter shall be deemed part of the cost of the improvement. All engineering and inspection costs, and legal and advertising costs, including a proper proportion of the compensation, salaries and expenses of the engineering staff, properly chargeable to any improvement, shall be deemed a part of the cost of the improvement. When revenue bonds or certificates are issued to obtain money with which to make the improvement, all costs and estimated costs incurred in issuing such revenue bonds or certificates and obtaining such funds shall be deemed a part of the cost of the improvement. When local improvements are made by Town employees, all legal charges, advertising costs, engineering costs, payrolls, materials and equipment rental at the prevailing rates, plus not more than 15 percent of the total of payroll, material and equipment rental costs for general over-head expense, may be included in the cost of the improvement. When the improvement has been completed, the Town Commission shall ascertain and determine the total cost of the improvement. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  1) 
Sec. 18-106. - Method of making special assessments.

(1)  By a percentage of the assessed taxable value of the property assessed; 
(2)  In proportion to the benefits which may result from the improvement; 
(3)  By the foot frontage of the property bounding or abutting upon the improvement. 
(b)  When a majority of the recorded owners of the frontage of lands liable to be assessed for any special local improvement shall petition the Town Commission for any such improvement, the Commission may order such improvement to be made. In other cases public improvement shall be made in the discretion of the Town Commission. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  6) 
Sec. 18-107. - Objections to improvements. 
    At the meeting for hearing objections to local improvements, or at a time and place to which the meeting may be adjourned, any person aggrieved may appear in person, by attorney or by petition and may object to or protest against the improvement. The Town Commission shall consider the objections and protests, if any, and may confirm, amend, modify or rescind the resolution of necessity and shall determine whether the improvement shall be made and how the cost thereof shall be paid. The determination of the Town Commission shall be final and conclusive. If the Town Commission determines to proceed with such improvement as originally proposed or in an amended or modified form, it shall adopt a resolution determining to proceed, as provided in section 18-109. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  7) 
Sec. 18-108. - Claims arising out of improvements. 
    The owner of any lot or land bounding and abutting upon a proposed special improvement who claims that he will sustain damage by reason of the improvement shall present such claim to the Town Commission at the time of its meeting on the question of whether it should proceed with the improvement as provided in section 18-107. Such claim shall be in writing and shall set forth the amount of damages claimed with a general description of the property with respect to which it is claimed the damage will accrue. Any owner who fails to do so shall be deemed to have waived such damage and shall be barred from thereafter filing a claim or receiving damages therefor. This provision shall apply to all damage which will obviously result from the improvement but shall not deprive the owner of his right to recover damages arising without his fault from acts of the Town or its agents. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  9) 
Sec. 18-109. - Resolution determining to proceed. 
    If, after hearing the objections and protests, if any, the Town Commission determines that it is expedient to proceed with such improvement in the original or modified form, the Town Commission shall adopt a resolution determining to proceed with such improvement, which resolution shall disclose what part of the total cost and expenses of the improvement shall be chargeable against and assessed against the property benefited by the improvement and what part or proportion of the total costs shall be paid by the Town from its general fund or any special fund on hand for such purpose. The resolution may direct that the whole or any part of the cost and expenses thereof be assessed against the property abutting upon the improvement or may provide that all property benefited by the improvement may be assessed for such improvement in the manner set out in the resolution. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  9) 
Sec. 18-110. - Assessment roll and notice. 
    Upon the completion of any improvement under the terms of this article, the Town Commission shall cause to be prepared a roll or list to be called the assessment list showing the improvement number, the number of the assessment lien, a description of each lot or parcel of land proposed to be assessed for such improvement, the amount proposed to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land and the name of each owner as shown on the Town tax roll or records. Such list shall be a public record constituting notice to the public of the lien against the land so assessed, and no other record or notice thereof shall be necessary to any person or corporation for that purpose. No errors, omissions, or mistakes in regard to description of property shall be held to invalidate any assessment appearing upon such assessment list where the description given is sufficient to identify the property. After the completion of the assessment list, the list shall be delivered to the Auditor-Clerk of the Town who shall thereupon give notice by publication once a week for two weeks in some newspaper published in the Town that the assessment list has been delivered to him and is open for inspection at his office and that, at a time and place mentioned in the notice not less than 15 days from the first publication, the Town Commissioners will meet to hear and determine any objections or defenses that may be filed to such assessment or the amount thereof. The notice shall state the number of the improvement, the general character of the work which has been performed, the name by which such improvement is generally known, and the location in which such improvement has been constructed. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  10) 
Sec. 18-111. - Assessments against United States, State or political subdivisions. 
    No special assessment shall be made under this article against the property of the United States nor against the State in respect to any lands or real property held by them for public purposes. Any political subdivision or taxing district of the State owning real estate within the Town may be assessed for any benefits to such property and shall be chargeable with notice of the assessment in the same manner as other persons. In addition to the notices required in this article, the Finance Director shall, at least ten days prior to the date of hearing on confirmation of the assessment list, mail a copy of the notice to the Clerk of the County or to the governing authority, as the case may be, of such county, district or political subdivision or taxing district, but failure to mail such notices or any irregularities in the notices shall not affect the validity of the assessment. The assessment shall be entered upon the assessment list, and it shall be the duty of the governing authority of the county, district, political subdivision or taxing district to pay the assessment out of any funds available for that purpose or, if there are no funds available, to levy and collect a sufficient amount at the next annual levy to pay the amount of the assessment, and such assessments shall not be a lien on such property nor shall the provisions of this article authorizing the sale of property for unpaid special assessments be applicable, but such lien may be enforced by appropriate action against the taxing division. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  11; Ord. No. 2010-03,  4, 8-25-2010) 
Sec. 18-112. - Hearing objections to and confirmation of assessment list. 
    At the time fixed in the notice for hearing objections or defenses to assessments for local improvements, or at an adjourned meeting, the Town Commission shall hear objections to the amount of such assessment which may be made by the owners of real property assessed for such improvement or by parties having an interest therein, and the Town Commission shall determine and hear all objections and protests to the proposed assessments under such rules and regulations as it may adopt. The Town Commission shall have a right to change or adjust any assessment appearing upon such assessment list at such meeting or at any adjourned meeting thereof. When such assessment list has been finally corrected and adjusted, the Town Commission shall adopt a resolution approving and confirming the assessment list and shall approve and confirm all assessments as finally fixed and adjusted at such hearing, and such assessments shall, from the date of confirmation by such resolution, constitute a lien on the respective lots or parcels of land, or other real property upon which they are levied, superior to all other liens, except those for Town and County taxes. All persons who fail to object to the proposed assessments in the manner provided in this article shall be deemed to have consented to and approved the assessments. All persons who appeared at such hearing and whose objections were overruled or denied shall be deemed to be bound by the action of the Town Commission after 30 days from the adoption of such resolution approving and confirming the assessment list unless suit challenging such assessment is filed. Substantial compliance with the procedure outlined shall be all that is necessary to render such assessment liens valid and incontestable, it being the expressed intention of the legislature that the requirements are directory rather than mandatory. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  12) 
Sec. 18-113. - Setting aside special assessments. 
    If any special assessment made under the terms of this article to defray the whole or part of the expense of any local improvement shall be either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court or if the Town Commission shall be satisfied that any assessment is so irregular or defective that the assessment cannot be enforced and collected or if the Town Commission shall have omitted to make such assessment when it might have done so, the Town Commission is hereby authorized to take all steps to cause a new assessment for the whole or any part of any improvement or against any property benefited by any improvement following as near as may be under the circumstances the provisions of this article. If such second assessment is annulled, the Town Commission may obtain and make other assessments until a valid assessment is made. No omission, informality or irregularity in the proceedings preliminary to the making of any special assessment shall affect the validity of the assessment, where the assessment list has been confirmed by the Town Commission, and the assessment list and the record thereof kept, the Finance Director shall be competent and sufficient evidence that the assessment was duly levied and the assessment list duly made and adopted and that all other proceedings necessary to the adoption of the assessment list were duly had, taken and performed as required by this article, and no variance from the directions contained in this article as to the form and manner of any of the proceedings shall be held material, unless it is clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. If any special assessment shall, in any suit where its validity is questioned, be adjudged invalid, the Town Commission may in its discretion notify the Finance Director to cease the collection of the assessment if it has been transmitted to him for collection. The Town Commission may proceed a new by proceedings either as in case of an original special assessment for the same purpose or by taking up the previous proceedings at any point and may make and levy a new assessment in the place and stead of the assessment which shall have been adjudged invalid, and the Finance Director shall ascertain and note thereon payments which have been made on such invalid assessment for the same purpose, which notation shall cancel the assessments as to the parcels and lots on which such payments were made to the extent of the payments. Such new assessments shall be collected in the same manner as original special assessments. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  13; Ord. No. 2010-03,  4, 8-25-2010) 
Sec. 18-114. - Suits, actions, writs or special proceedings. 
    For the period of 30 days after the date of the confirmation of any special assessment levied under the terms of this article, any person aggrieved shall have the right to contest the legality thereof by suit, action, writ or special proceedings, after which time no suit, action, writ or special proceedings in any manner questioning the legality of the special assessment shall lie for any cause whatsoever. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  14) 
Sec. 18-115. - Method of collection. 
    The resolution approving and confirming the assessment list for local improvements shall provide whether such special assessments shall be payable in cash within 30 days from the adoption of such resolution or whether such special assessments shall be payable in annual installments not exceeding seven annual installments, in the discretion of the Town Commission, the first of which shall be payable on or before the expiration of 30 days from the date of confirmation. If the Town Commission desires that the assessment shall be payable in annual installments, it shall fix an interest rate not to exceed eight percent per annum upon such unpaid installments. The owner of the property desiring to pay his assessment in installments, if permitted, shall, on or before 30 days from the confirmation of such assessments, file with the Finance Director a written application to pay the assessment in installments, which application shall state that the applicant and property owner waives all irregularities or defects, constitutional, jurisdictional or otherwise, in the proceedings for the improvement for which the assessments are levied and in the apportionment of the cost thereof, and thereafter the validity of such assessments shall not be called in question. The payment of an assessment, in whole or in part, shall constitute a waiver of all defects, constitutional, jurisdictional or otherwise, in the proceedings. The application shall also contain an agreement that the applicant and property owner will pay the assessment in installments at the date fixed by the resolution, with interest at the rates specified in the resolution. The application shall also make a reference to the number of the improvement and shall contain a description of the lot or parcel of property of the applicant assessed for such improvement. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. VII, Art. 5,  15; Charter Amendment, June 3, 1952; Ord. No. 2010-03,  4, 8-25-2010) 
Sec. 18-116. - Lien docket.

Sec. 18-117. - Special assessment revolving fund. 
    The Town Commission shall have the right to create by ordinance any special assessment revolving fund out of which may be paid the cost of any proposed improvement where special assessments are levied or are to be levied to pay all or any portion of the cost of such improvement. Moneys raised or appropriated for the purpose of making improvements where special assessments are to be levied to repay all of or a portion of the cost thereof may be deposited in such special assessment revolving fund, and the proceeds from the collection of principal and interest of any such assessment liens shall be deposited to the credit of and shall replenish the fund. The Town shall transfer to such fund yearly from the general fund or other source of revenue an amount not less than the Town's portion of the cost of the improvements made from moneys in such fund. Such special assessment revolving fund shall constitute a permanent fund to be used for the purpose of paying the cost of local improvements, where the proceeds of the assessment liens levied in connection therewith are to be deposited in the fund as collected. The moneys in such special assessment revolving fund at the close of the fiscal year shall not be transferred or appropriated to any other fund, but shall be used exclusively for the purposes of making local improvements where special assessments are to be levied to repay all or a part of the cost thereof.

    All assessments and liens for sidewalks, street improvements, sewer assessments or other public improvements and all collection of such assessments and liens heretofore made by the Town are hereby legalized and declared valid and of full force, virtue and effect, binding in law or equity; and such assessments and liens shall not be set aside or invalidated because of any error, defect, informality or omission which shall not amount to a want of due process of law under the Constitution of the State or the Constitution of the United States. 
(Sp. Acts 1951, Ch. 27675, Pt. X, Art. 7,  2) 
Sec. 18-120. - Foreclosure. 
    Should any assessment lien remain in the hands of the Town and be in default and remain in default for a period of 90 days after becoming due and payable, it shall be the duty of the Finance Director to forward to the Town Attorney for collection a certified list of such assessment liens. It shall be the duty of the Town Attorney to institute foreclosure proceedings to foreclose the assessment liens against the property encumbered thereby and against which the lien exists, and the owner of the property against which the lien exists shall be liable to the Town for a reasonable attorney's fee with which to compensate the Town Attorney for services in collecting the amounts due on the lien. The final decree to be entered shall decree the amount of the lien and reasonable attorney's fees and all costs occasioned or necessitated by such foreclosure as a lien against the property described. The lien for the attorney's fees and costs shall arise whenever the lien is placed in the hands of the Town Attorney for collection, and such lien for the attorney's fees shall not exceed 15 percent of the amount due. In foreclosing such special assessment liens, the Town may pursue and follow any recognized chancery proceeding to enforce liens, and upon such suit being brought, a certified copy of the assessment list and of the resolution approving and confirming the assessment list shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount and existence of the lien upon the property described. The decree rendered in the case for the enforcement and collection of the amount due shall provide for a reasonable attorney's fee for the institution of the suit and the collection of the amount due on the lien, together with all costs occasioned in bringing the suit and foreclosing the lien, and such fees and costs shall be decreed to be a lien upon the lands described and shall be collected at the time and in the manner provided for the collection of the amount evidenced by the assessment lien. Any number of assessment liens may be foreclosed in one chancery action and the final decree to be entered shall determine the principal interest, costs and the attorney's fees to be chargeable against each property encumbered.

ARTICLE V. - INVESTMENT PLAN 

Sec. 18-131. - Scope. 
    There is hereby created the Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea's Investment Plan which shall provide exclusive authorization, regulation, guidance and requirements pertaining to the investment activities of the Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea. These policies shall pertain to only those funds in excess of those required to meet the Town's short-term expenses. Financial assets including general fund reserves, debt service funds, special revenue funds, enterprise funds, internal service funds, and other funds which may be created from time to time, shall be administered in accordance with this investment policy. This policy shall not pertain to pension, trust, or bond funds where there are other policies or indenture requirements in effect. 
(Ord. No. 372,  2, 2-13-96) 
Sec. 18-132. - Objectives. 
(a)  The objectives of the Town's investment plan are as follows in order of priority: 
(1)  Preservation of capital; 
(2)  Liquidity; 
(3)  Investment yield. 
(b)  Preservation of capital. The Town will ensure the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting risk wherever possible. A discussion of the types of investment risk follows: 
(1)  Default risk. Default risk applies to the failure of an issuer of a security or other debt-related instrument to return either principal or interest on it. Included within default risk is the potential failure of an issuer or firm in the secondary securities market to deliver a security in return for payment which has been received. The Town will mitigate the effects of default risk by investing in only the safest types of securities as further detailed in section [18-133], eligible securities; pre-qualifying all financial institutions and securities dealers with whom the Town does business as further detailed in section [18-134], qualifications of financial institutions, and requiring delivery versus payment (DVP) for all transactions involving book entry securities. 
(2)  Market risk. Market risk applies to the potential fluctuation in value of a security during the period in which it is held. In the case of a bond, its yield to maturity is known at the time of purchase as is the amount of principal to be returned at maturity. If the bond is sold prior to its maturity, the amount of principal received depends on market conditions. The potential exists for either gain or loss of capital on sale prior to maturity. The Town will mitigate the effects of market risk by structuring the investment portfolio so that security maturities approximate a conservative estimate of cash requirements, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities in the open market prior to their maturity. 
(3)  Sovereign risk. Sovereign risk applies to the potential fluctuation in value of securities in overseas markets. Investments can be dollar or otherwise denominated and placed with foreign institutions or foreign subsidiaries of United States institutions. The Town will avoid sovereign risk in its entirety by investing only in dollar-denominated instruments of United States institutions as detailed further in section [18-133], eligible securities. 
(4)  Reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk applies to the potential movement of interest rates during the holding period of a group of securities. Reinvestment risk is associated with the potential loss of future interest gain rather than the loss of capital. The Town will mitigate the effects of reinvestment risk by: investing funds that are not associated with anticipated future cash requirement through a range of maturities; and conservatively lengthening maturities when yields are above historical averages and shortening maturities when yields are below historical averages. 
(c)  Liquidity. The Town will structure its portfolio so that securities mature in advance of anticipated cash requirements (static liquidity). The maturity structure of the portfolio will be supported by a cash forecasting method that will be updated quarterly. The portfolio will be invested in securities supported by active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity) to provide cash through the sale of securities in the event that it is necessary. 
(d)  Yield. The Town will not compromise its safety or liquidity objectives for the purpose of potential yield enhancement. Investments are limited to relatively low-risk securities in anticipation of earning a market rate of return on the security and maturity selected at the time the investment was placed. While it may be necessary from time to time to sell a security prior to its maturity to meet unanticipated cash needs, this policy specifically prohibits buying and selling securities for the sole purpose of realizing trading profits. 
(Ord. No. 372,  3, 2-13-96) 
Sec. 18-133. - Authorized investments. 
    The Town's eligible investments shall be as follows: 
(1)  Bonds, notes or other obligations of the United States for which the credit of the United States is pledged for the payment of the principal and interest or dividends thereof (F.S  215.47(1)(a) and 218.345(1)(b)). 
(2)  Securities of, or other interest in, any open-end or closed-end management type of investment company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. Section 80a-1 et seq., as amended from time to time, provided that the portfolio of such investment company or investment trust is limited to United States government obligations and to repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such United States government obligations and provided that such investment company or investment trust takes delivery of such collateral either directly or through an authorized custodian. 
(3)  Investments in securities authorized by subsection (1) above may be under repurchase agreements. All repurchase agreement transactions shall adhere to the requirements of a master repurchase agreement which is negotiated and authorized by the Town Commission. The Town will require a minimum over-collateralization of 102 percent on all repurchase agreements. 
(4)  Participation in the State Board of Administration (SBA), local government surplus trust funds investment pool. 
(Ord. No. 372,  4, 2-13-96) 
Sec. 18-134. - Qualifications of financial institutions. 
(a)  Broker dealers. The Town will only transact business with those broker dealers classified as primary dealers that report directly to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with a minimum net capital of $20,000,000.00. Annual reports may be required from each primary dealer to ensure its status and minimum capital requirement. The Town may purchase or sell securities through the broker dealer of its Town-authorized financial institution. When purchasing or selling securities in excess of $2,000,000.00 through broker dealers, the selection process will be through competitive bid with a minimum of three firms contacted for each trade. 
(b)  Public depositories. The Town will only transact business with those public depositories which are listed as qualified public depositories under F.S. ch. 280. The Town will further limit the qualified public depositories to those institutions which have a branch or their main office within Broward County, Florida. 
(c)  Other financial institutions. The Town may transact business with open-end management type investment companies or investment trusts registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. Section 80a-1 et seq., as amended from time to time, provided that the portfolio of such investment companies or investment trusts is limited to United States Government obligations. 
(Ord. No. 372,  5, 2-13-96) 
Sec. 18-135. - Safekeeping and custody. 
    To protect against potential fraud and embezzlement, the assets of the Town shall be secured through third party custody and safekeeping procedures. All securities purchased by the Town under this policy shall be properly designated as assets of the Town and shall be protected through the use of a third party custodial and safekeeping agent. The third party custodian and safekeeping agent shall be selected and approved in accordance with the Town procurement policy. Whenever possible, the Town will use preformatted wire transfers to restrict the transfer of funds to preauthorized accounts. In addition, delivery versus payment procedures will be used for all eligible securities. Physical instruments, with the exception of certificates of deposit, must be delivered to and held by an approved third party institution. 
    Certificates of deposit issued by a local bank may be held in safekeeping at that institution. The institution shall issue a copy of the certificate of deposit, or other confirmation of purchase to be kept on file by the Town. The confirmation of purchase should indicate the amount, interest rate, date of issue and maturity date of the certificates of deposit. 
    Upon delivery of securities, be it in book entry or physical form, the agent shall issue a safekeeping receipt to the Town which at a minimum shall list each instrument, its rate, maturity and registration in the name of the Town. Safekeeping procedures may be reviewed annually by the Town's independent Auditor. 
(Ord. No. 372,  6, 2-13-96) 
Sec. 18-136. - Reporting. 
    The Town Clerk shall provide an investment portfolio report to the Town Manager annually, in conjunction with issuance of the Town's annual financial statements. This report shall contain a summary of the Town's present and matured investment securities, book value, income earned and market value for the fiscal year ending September 30. It will provide detail as to each investment held, original cost, purchase date, maturity, yield and other performance measures as may be requested. 
(Ord. No. 372,  7, 2-13-96) 
Sec. 18-137. - Delegation of Town. 
    The Town Clerk is designated as the primary investment officer of the Town and is responsible for investment decisions and activities. The day-to-day administration of the cash management program is handled within the Town Clerk's Office. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures so established. 
    Positions authorized as investment signatories are Town Manager, Town Clerk, and Deputy Town Clerk. Other than automated overnight bank repurchase agreements, each investment transaction shall require written authorization by two investment signatories with no more than one signatory coming from the Town Clerk. The persons holding these positions are also authorized to initiate wire transfers for the Town. These investment plan procedures shall be reviewed by the Town's authorized independent auditors as part of the Town's annual financial audit. 
(Ord. No. 372,  8, 2-13-96) 
Sec. 18-138. - Prudence. 
    The standard of prudence to be applied by the investment officer shall be the "prudent person" rule, which states: "Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income derived." The "prudent person" rule shall be applied in the context of managing the overall portfolio. 
    The Town Clerk and staff, acting in accordance with these written procedures and exercising due diligence, shall not be held personally responsible for a specific security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that these deviations are reported immediately and that appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

There is hereby levied and established a schedule of rates and charges for sanitary sewage disposal services against each and every person, firm, partnership, corporation or other legal entity owning or using any buildings or structures in the Town inhabited or used by human beings as a place of residence, business or otherwise. The provisions of section 28-79 (and references noted therein) of the City of Fort Lauderdale Code of Ordinances as stated below are incorporated herein: 
"Section 28-79. Exemptions from wastewater commodity charges. 
Where water used for lawn sprinkling, gardening or commercial-industrial purposes does not enter the sanitary sewer system, relief from payment of the wastewater commodity charge on the presently metered total water consumption is provided as follows: 
(1)  A customer may have installed by the department, as stipulated in section 28-141 and approved by the building department, a separate metered connection with the water mains to measure the water so used. 
(2)  A customer may apply for a meter, as stipulated in section 28-141 to have the meter installed at his expense and with the approval of the building department, to measure the water which does not enter the sewer system. The sewerage service charge will be billed on the difference in consumption between the two (2) meters; provided, however, that the credit to be given shall not reduce the total wastewater charge to an amount less than the fixed monthly charge." 
(b)  Amounts of rates and charges. 
(1)  Monthly base facility charge per single-family unit: 
$9.78 effective 10/2016; 
$10.02 effective 10/2017; and

$10.02 effective 10/2017; and 
$10.27 effective 10/2018; 
multiplied by the number of applicable equivalent units, based on the calculation as follows: 
a.  Equivalent units are deemed to be the average volume in gallons of the three highest months water usage during the 12-month period ending September 30, 2011, divided by a factor of 10,000 (rounded to the nearest whole number). At any time the Town may recalculate the equivalent units for a customer based on water usage during the preceding 12-month period. The customer may make a written request to the Town to recalculate the equivalent units based on water usage during the preceding 12-month period, provided that no more than one such request is made per calendar year. 
b.  In the event the there is a change in ownership or substantial change in use of a property, the equivalent units shall be deemed the same as that of the prior use of that property. At any time the Town may recalculate the equivalent units for a customer based on water usage during the preceding 12-month period. The customer may make a written request to the Town to recalculate the equivalent units based on water usage during the preceding 12-month period, provided that no more than one such request is made per calendar year. 
c.  In the event the customer is located at a property with no prior sewer connection, the equivalent units shall be determined based on meter size as shown in the following table: 
Meter Size Equivalent Units 5/8 " 1.0 3/4" 1.0 1" 2.5 1.5" 5.0 2" 8.0 3" 16.0 4" 25.0 6" 50.0 8" 80.0 10" 115.0  
At any time the Town may recalculate the equivalent units for a customer based on water usage during the preceding 12-month period. The customer may make a written request to the Town to recalculate the equivalent units based on water usage during the preceding 12-month period, provided that no more than one such request is made per calendar year. 
(4)  Consumption rate charged per 1,000 gallons of water usage: 
All customer classes: 
$5.63 effective 10/2016; 
$5.77 effective 10/2017; and 
$5.91 effective 10/2018. 
Residential units will not be charged a consumption rate for usage in excess of 10,000 gallons per month. 
(5)  Monthly customer service/administration charge per meter: 
All customer classes: 
$1.44 effective 10/2016; 
$1.47 effective 10/2017; and 
$1.50 effective 10/2018. 
(c)  Time and method of payment. All statements for sewer service shall be on the same bill for water, and the sewer charges must be paid at the time of payment of the charge for water service. If such sewer charges are not paid within 30 days, after the same shall become due and payable, the Town Manager or the Manager's designee is hereby authorized and may disconnect such consumer's water supply in accordance with subsection (d) below. 
(d)  When bills due and payable; disconnection of services. All accounts shall be due and payable on the date statements are submitted to the consumers and, in the event of the failure of any consumer of water and sewer service to pay the account within 30 days after the same shall become due and payable, the Town Manager or the Manager's designee is hereby authorized to disconnect such consumer's water supply. 
    Prior to actual disconnection of a consumer's water supply, the consumer shall be given written notice of the pending termination of water and sewer service, the date of proposed termination and the specific reason(s) therefor. Such notice shall also advise the consumer that he may protest the proposed termination of water and sewer service as unjustified and may meet with a designated employee for the purpose of presenting objections to such proposed termination. 
    In the event that a water consumer whose water service has been cut off by reason of nonpayment of any water or sewer bill desires to have water service reestablished, the consumer shall pay the entire amount of such delinquent water or sewer bill, together with a $5.00 fee for a service call to disconnect the consumer's water supply and a $5.00 fee for a service call to reestablish such water service. 
    Water service shall not be established or reestablished at the request of a consumer whose service has been terminated for nonpayment of a water or sewer bill until all amounts due for water or sewer service, together with any charges for disconnection or reestablishment of such consumer's water supply, have been paid in full. When service has been disconnected at the water main, an additional fee of $360.00 shall be paid by the consumer for the reestablishment of the water service.

(Ord. No. 474,  3, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-32. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the Town to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within [the] Town; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with State and Federal law, including F.S.  337.401, as it may be amended, [the] Town's Home-Rule Authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other Federal and State law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 474,  4, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-33. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words, and abbreviations shall have the meanings given herein, unless otherwise expressly stated. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense; words in the plural number include the singular number; and words in the singular number include the plural number; and the masculine gender includes the feminine gender. "And" and "or" may be read conjunctively or disjunctively. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Unless otherwise expressly stated, words not defined in this article shall be given the meaning set forth in Title 47 of the United States Code, and, if not defined therein, their common and ordinary meaning. References to governmental entities (whether persons or entities) refer to those entities or their successors in authority. If specific provisions of law referred to herein are renumbered, then the reference shall be read to refer to the renumbered provision. References to laws, ordinances or regulations shall be interpreted broadly to cover government actions, however nominated, and include laws, ordinances and regulations now in force or hereinafter enacted or amended. 
    Abandonment shall mean the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. For example, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
    Communications facility or facility or system shall mean any permanent or temporary plant, equipment or property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the Town and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
    Communications services shall mean the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service", as defined in F.S.  202.11(2), as it may be amended, is not included in the definition of "communications services" and cable service providers or providers of service via an open video system may be subject to other ordinances of the Town. 
    Communications services provider shall mean any person providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. "Communications services provider" shall also include any person that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
    FCC shall mean the Federal Communications Commission. 
    In public rights-of-way or in the public rights-of-way shall mean in, on, over, under or across the public rights-of-way. 
    Person shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include Town to the extent the Town acts as a communications services provider. 
    Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or placing or maintaining shall mean to erect, construct, install, maintain, grade, excavate, place, repair, extend, replace, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A party providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
    Public rights-of-way shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, public highway, street, lane, bridge, sidewalk, road, waterway, tunnel, alley, or similar property for which the Town is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to such property pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface to the extent the Town holds a property interest therein. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal Town property except as described above and shall not include Town buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. No reference herein, or in any permit, to public rights-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the Town that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a registrant shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the Town and as the Town may have the undisputed right and power to give. 
    Registrant shall mean a communications services provider or other person that has registered with the Town in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
    Registration or register shall mean the process described in this article whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the Town. 
    Town shall mean [the] Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Florida. 
(Ord. No. 474,  5, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-34. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the Town shall first register with the Town in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the Town as of the effective date of this article shall comply with this article within 60 days from the effective date of this article, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation hereof. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the Town's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable Town ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(c)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the Town shall file a single registration with the Town which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article; 
(5)  A copy of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other Federal or State authority, if any; 
(6)  For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, including the number of the certificate of incorporation; and 
(7)  A security fund in accordance with this article. 
(d)  The Town Manager, or his designee shall review the information submitted by the applicant. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) above, the registration shall be effective and the Town shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the Town determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) above, the Town shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The Town shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the Town stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the Town and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration shall not in itself establish any right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the Town, but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the Town. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional Town ordinances, as well as any State or Federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the Town by April 1 of even-numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even-numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd-numbered year immediately preceding such even-numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even-numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3), a registrant shall provide updated information to the Town. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the Town restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable Town ordinances, codes or regulations and this article, a permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition precedent to obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall continue to apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(i)  A registrant that places or maintains communications facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be required to pay compensation to the Town as required by applicable law and ordinances of the Town. 
(Ord. No. 474,  6, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-35. - Transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the Town within 20 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 25-34 within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. 
    If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the Town Manager that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
    Any encumbrance on the communications facilities of the registrant in the public rights-of-way shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the Town under this article and applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 474,  7, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-36. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  Registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of State, Federal and local law and Town ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the Town or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the Town of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the Town may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The Town may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(c)  As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
(1)  An engineering plan signed and sealed by a Florida Registered Professional Engineer, or prepared by a person who is exempt from such registration requirements as provided in F.S.  471.003, identifying the location of the proposed facility, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where it is to be located, and the approximate size of facilities and equipment that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods or techniques); 
(3)  A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(4)  Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other persons with facilities in the public rights-of-way); 
(5)  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way; 
(6)  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the Town which will be affected; and 
(7)  Such additional information requested by the Town that the Town finds reasonably necessary to review such permit application. 
(d)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by State or Federal law, the Town shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way. The Town shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within the public rights-of way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, for the protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way or to accommodate Town plans for public improvements or projects that the Town determines are in the public interest. 
(e)  All communications facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. All facilities shall be placed underground to the extent that similarly situated utilities (electric, communications, etc.) are so required. The Town may require the use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit. The registrant shall be liable for the displacement, damage or destruction of any property, irrigation system or landscaping as a result of the placement or maintenance of its facility within the public rights-of-way. The Town Manager may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable law. All facilities shall be placed underground to the extent not inconsistent with the rules of the Public Service Commission. 
(f)  All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(g)  A registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to at least its original condition before such work after the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 days following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the Town may perform such restoration as it deems necessary and charge all costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S.  337.402, as it may be amended. The registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any improper restoration work at its own expense for 12 months following the original completion of the work. 
(h)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the Town of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S.  337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended. 
(i)  A permit from the Town constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities on public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as it may be amended. 
(l)  Registrant shall place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in compliance with all applicable standards as established by all local, State or Federal law and in conformance with the Town ordinances, codes and regulations. Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(m)  In the interest of the public's health, safety and welfare, upon request of the Town, a registrant shall coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way. The Town may require registrant to alter its placement or maintenance schedule as Town determines to be reasonably necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. The Town may provide a more definite time frame based on individual Town construction or maintenance schedules. 
(n)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the Town or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the Town. 
(o)  Town makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of Town's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work or costs incurred by registrant or provision of services shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the Town's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way and Town makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(p)  The Town shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. In the event the Town determines that a violation exists with respect to registrant's placement or maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way that is not considered to be an emergency or danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Town will provide registrant at least three days written notice setting forth the violation and requesting correction. 
(q)  A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format or an electronic format specified by the Town, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the Town. The plans shall be in a digitized format showing the two-dimensional location of the facilities based on the Town's geographical database, or other format acceptable to the Town. The Town shall maintain the confidentiality of such plans and any other information provided in accordance with F.S.  202.195, as it may be amended. 
(r)  The Town reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the Town in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. Registrant shall, if registrant so agrees, allow Town facilities to be co-located within [the] Town's public rights-of-way through the use of a joint trench during registrant's construction project. Such joint trench projects shall be negotiated in good faith by separate agreement between registrant and [the] Town and may be subjected to other Town rights-of-way requirements. The Town further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the Town and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(s)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the Town, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than 30 days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. If [the] Town requests a temporary raising or lowering of a facility for a public purpose, [the] Town shall not be charged for the temporary raising or lowering of the facility. 
(Ord. No. 474,  8, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-37. - Suspension of permits. 
(a)  Subject to section 25-38 below, the Town Manager, or his designee may suspend a permit for work in the public rights-of-way for one or more of the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to satisfy permit conditions, including conditions set forth in this article or other applicable Town ordinances, codes or regulations governing placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way, including without limitation, failure to take reasonable safety precautions to alert the public of work at the work site, or to restore any public rights-of-way; 
(2)  Misrepresentation or fraud by registrant in a registration or permit application to the Town; 
(3)  Failure to properly renew or ineffectiveness of registration; or 
(4)  Failure to relocate or remove facilities as may be lawfully required by the Town. 
(b)  After the suspension of a permit pursuant to this section, the Town Manager or his designee shall provide written notice of the reason for the suspension to the registrant. 
(Ord. No. 474,  9, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-38. - Appeals. 
(a)  Final, written decisions of the Town Manager, or his designee, suspending or denying a permit, denying an application for a registration or denying an application for renewal of a registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must be filed with the Town Clerk within 30 days of the date of the final, written decision to be appealed. Any appeal not timely filed as set forth above shall be waived. The Town Commission shall hear the appeal. The hearing shall occur within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal, unless waived by the registrant, and a written decision shall be rendered within 20 days of the hearing. Upon correction of any grounds that gave rise to a suspension or denial, the suspension or denial shall be lifted. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall effect the remedies the Town has available under applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 474,  10, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-39. - Conditional use of public rights-of-way. 
(a)  In the event registrant desires to use its existing facilities or to construct new facilities for the purpose of providing other utility or non-utility services to existing or potential consumers or resellers, by providing any other services other than the provision of communications service, or for providing any other use to existing or potential consumers, a registrant shall seek such additional and separate authorization from Town for such activities as may be required by applicable law. 
(b)  To the extent that a registrant leases or otherwise uses the facilities of a person that is duly registered or otherwise authorized to place or maintain facilities in the public rights-of-way of the Town, registrant shall make no claim, nor assert any right, which will impede the lawful exercise of the Town's rights, including requiring the removal of such facilities from the public rights-of-way of the Town, regardless of the effect on registrant's ability to place or maintain its own communications facilities in public rights-of-way of the Town. 
(Ord. No. 474,  11, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-40. - Involuntary termination of registration. 
(a)  The Town may terminate a registration if: 
(1)  A Federal or State authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification or license to provide communications services; 
(2)  The registrant's placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way presents an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the public rights-of-way and the registrant fails to remedy the danger promptly after receipt of written notice; or 
(3)  The registrant ceases to use all of its communications facilities in public rights-of-way and has not complied with section 25-47 of this article. 
(b)  Prior to termination, the registrant shall be notified by the Town Manager, or his designee, with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to the proposed termination action, including which of subsections (a)(1) through (3) above is applicable as the reason therefore, and describing the proposed action of the Town with respect thereto. The registrant shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice within which to address or eliminate the reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the Town Manager, or his designee, to accomplish the same. If the plan is rejected, the Town Manager, or his designee, shall provide written notice of such rejection to the registrant and shall make a recommendation to the Town Commission regarding a final decision as to termination of registration. A decision by a Town to terminate a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the Town Commission. A registrant shall be notified by written notice of any decision by the Town Commission to terminate its registration. Such written notice shall be sent within seven days after the decision. 
(c)  In the event of termination, the former registrant shall: (1) notify the Town of the assumption or anticipated assumption by another registrant of ownership of the registrant's communications facilities in public rights-of-way; or (2) provide the Town with an acceptable plan for disposition of its communications facilities in public rights-of-way. If a registrant fails to comply with this subsection (c), the Town may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limiting to taking possession of the facilities, requiring the registrant's bonding company within 90 days of the termination to remove some or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before the removal, or requiring that some or all of the facilities be removed and the public rights-of-way restored to its original condition before the removal at the registrant's expense. 
(d)  In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the Town safe. 
(e)  In the event of termination of a registration, this provision does not permit the Town to cause the removal of any communications facilities that are used to provide another service for which the registrant holds a valid certification or license with the governing Federal or State agency, where required, and is properly registered with the Town for such certificated or licensed service, where required. 
(Ord. No. 474,  12, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-41. - Existing communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
    A communications services provider with an existing communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the Town has 60 days from the effective date of this article to comply with the terms of this article, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation thereof. 
(Ord. No. 474,  12, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-42. - Insurance. 
(a)  A registrant shall not commence construction, operation or maintenance of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under this section and approval of such insurance by risk management of the Town, nor shall a registrant allow any contractor or subcontractor to commence work on its contract or subcontract until all similar such insurance required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the registrant has facilities in the public rights-of-way, and for a period thereafter as specified in the minimum coverages described below. If the registrant, its contractors or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the Town may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. 
(b)  Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance, shall be filed with the Risk Manager Coordinator. For entities that are entering the market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of this chapter, the certificate shall be filed within 60 calendar days of the adoption of this chapter, annually thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. 
(c)  These certificates of insurance shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least 45 calendar days prior written notice has been given to the Town. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the State of Florida. Financial ratings must be no less than "A-VI" in the latest edition of "Bests Key Rating Guide", published by A.M. Best Guide. A registrant may self-insure.

(c)  Before imposing a fine pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Town shall give written notice of the violation and its intention to assess such penalties, which notice shall contain a description of the alleged violation. Following receipt of such notice, the registrant shall have 30 days to either: (1) cure the violation to the Town's satisfaction and the Town shall make good faith reasonable efforts to assist in resolving the violation; or (2) file an appeal with the Town to contest the alleged violation.

(f)  In any proceeding before the Town where there exists an issue with respect to a registrant's performance of its obligations pursuant to this article, the registrant shall be given the opportunity to provide such information as it may have concerning its compliance with the terms and conditions of this article.

(Ord. No. 474,  20, 6-26-01) 
Sec. 25-49. - Reports and records. 
(a)  Each registrant shall, upon 30 calendar days written notice, if reasonably possible, but in no event less than five business days written notice, provide the Town access to all books and records related to the construction, maintenance, or repair of the facility to the extent the Town review of the books and records is necessary to manage its rights-of-way. 
(b)  Any and all non-proprietary or non-confidential books and records may be copied by the Town. To the maximum extent permitted by F.S.  202.195, as amended, such books and records shall be kept confidential and exempt from the provisions of F.S.  119.07(1). A registrant is responsible for obtaining or maintaining the necessary possession or control of all books and records related to the construction, maintenance or repair of the facility, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records must be maintained for a period of five years, except that any record that is a public record must be maintained for the period required by State law.

(1)  Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the facility; and 
(2)  Copies of any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the operator or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the operator directly or indirectly.

Public rights-of-way do not include buildings, parks, or other property owned or leased by the Town. No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to a public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the Town that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the Town and as the Town may have the undisputed right and power to give.

In succeeding provisions of this chapter, all these activities are referred to as franchise transfers. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-22. - Franchise required. 
(a)  Every operator must obtain. A cable operator must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a cable system or providing cable service; an operator of an open video system must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing services via an open video system. No franchise shall become effective without the franchisee entering into a franchise agreement with the Town. The fact that a cable system or open video system may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise, license, or other authorization for those other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same facilities, it must comply with requirements applicable to providers of telecommunications services or to operators of telecommunication facilities. 
(b)  Purpose and characteristics. The purpose of requiring authorizations by service is to ensure as far as possible and appropriate that persons providing similar services are treated similarly, considering differences in circumstances, and to comply with requirements of Federal law which may require the Town to separate its authority over cable systems or open video systems from its authority over other providers of telecommunications services, the Town shall require individual franchises for the provision of particular services. The revocation of a franchise for one particular service in and of itself will not affect the authority of a franchise holder to continue to provide services for which it holds other franchises. No franchise shall be exclusive and competition shall be encouraged. The issuance of a franchise shall not affect the Town's right to itself construct, operate, or repair any cable system or open video system, with or without a franchise. 
(c)  Exceptions. A franchise requirement may be waived for a cable system or an open video system that is not designed to provide service in the Town, and that does not provide service in the Town. For such facilities, the Town may issue a license. Every license shall require the licensee to obtain a franchise if it is determined that the license is being used in a manner that creates a competitive advantage for that operator or otherwise unduly discriminates in favor of such operator. In any case, the license must provide that if limitations of license are violated, the licensee must pay the maximum franchise fee required by divisions 2 and 3 of this article and otherwise bring itself into compliance with this chapter. 
(d)  Nature of grant. Neither a franchise nor a license shall convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights-of-way. The right is only the personal right to occupy rights-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in the franchise or license; the right may not be subdivided or subleased. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-23. - Compensation required. 
(a)  Every operator must pay. Every cable operator and every operator of an open video system must pay a fee except as provided in subsection 26-23(b). Except as provided in subsection 26-23(b), this fee shall be based upon a percentage of gross revenues. 
(b)  Exceptions. The franchise fees required under divisions 2 and 3 of this article need not be paid if: 
(1)  State law or Charter requires otherwise; or during any transition period for a current franchise holder. In cases subject to this exception, the highest permissible fee shall be paid. 
(2)  In the case of a cable system or an open video system that is not designed to provide service in the Town, and that does not provide service in the Town. The Town shall establish a fee in lieu of the fees specified in divisions 2 and 3 of this article that recovers an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the property used in the Town and reserves the right to charge additional fees as contemplated by subsection 26-23(d). 
(c)  Application to persons that provide different types of services. The fact that a fee is paid on one type of service provided over a cable or open video system, does not excuse an operator from its duty to pay fees on other types of services provided over that facility. As an example, and not as a limitation of the foregoing, a cable operator that pays a franchise fee on revenues derived from the provision of cable services must pay the fees imposed upon telecommunication service providers to the extent that it provides telecommunications services; likewise, the operator of a telecommunications facility must pay a franchise fee to the extent it provides cable services to subscribers via a cable system. 
(d)  General rules for payment of fees. 
(1)  Unless otherwise specified in a franchise agreement or a license, franchise and license fees shall be paid to the Town quarterly, and not later than 45 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter. 
(2)  Unless a franchise agreement or license provides otherwise, each franchise or license fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated. 
(3)  No acceptance by the Town of any franchise or license fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the Town may have for additional sums payable. 
(4)  The franchise or license fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in this title, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, permit fees and business license taxes are not waived and remain applicable, and other fees and assessments to recover costs associated with operating and maintaining the right-of-way that may be established from time to time by resolution of the Town Commission. 
(5)  Within 90 calendar days following the end of the calendar year, each person which paid a franchise fee based upon gross revenues shall submit a statement, attested to by a certified public accountant or the chief financial officer of such person, setting forth gross revenues of the cable or open video system, by category, and describing what revenues were included and what revenues, if any, generated or derived from operations in the Town were excluded in the fee calculation, and any adjustments made to gross revenues. If payments are late, in addition to paving any applicable penalties or damages, the person that owes the fee shall pay interest on the amount owed at the statutory interest rates applicable to judgments. 
(6)  The Town may, upon five business days advance written notice, inspect and examine any and all books and records reasonably necessary to the determination of whether fees have been accurately computed and paid. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a person that is obligated to pay a fee ceases to provide service for any reason (including as a result of a transfer), such person shall make a final payment of any amounts owed to the Town within 90 calendar days of the date its operations in the Town cease, and shall provide a statement of gross revenues for the calendar year through the dates operations ceased which statement shall contain the information and certification required by [this chapter]. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-24. - General conditions upon use of rights-of-way. 
(a)  Responsibility for costs. Except as expressly provided otherwise, any act that a cable or open video systems operator, its contractors or subcontractors are required to perform under this section shall be performed at their cost. If a cable or open video systems operator fails to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for performance, the Town may perform the work, and bill the cable or open video systems operator therefor. The cable or open video systems operator shall pay the amounts billed within 30 calendar days. 
(b)  Construction procedures and placement of facilities; obligation to minimize interference with use of rights-of-way. 
(1)  The construction, operation and repair of cable or open video systems are subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the Town that have jurisdiction in such matters, and shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations and practices affecting such system. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning codes and safety codes. In addition, the construction, operation and repair shall be performed in a manner consistent with high industry standards. Persons engaged in the construction, operation or repair of cable or open video systems shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property. 
(2)  Construction, operation or repair of a cable or open video system shall not commence until written permits, if required, have been properly filed for and obtained from the proper Town officials and all required permit and associated fees paid. In any permit so issued, the Town may impose as a condition of the granting of the permit such conditions and regulations as may be necessary to the management of the right-of-way, including, by way of example and not limitation, for the purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way, for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures, and for the protection of the Town and the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(3)  Without limiting the foregoing, cable or open video systems shall be constructed, operated and repaired in accordance with good engineering practices. No work on the facilities shall be performed except by experienced and properly trained personnel. The operator of a cable or open video system is responsible for all the acts of its contractors and subcontractors, and for ensuring that its contractors and subcontractors perform all work in compliance with this chapter, and any applicable franchise agreement. 
(4)  Operators of cable or open video systems must follow Town-established requirements for placement of facilities in rights-of-way, and must in any event install facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use of the rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing communications facilities. The Town may require that facilities be installed at a particular time, place, or manner as a condition of access to a particular right-of-way, and may require a person using the right-of-way to cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on the right-of-way through joint trenching and other arrangements. 
(5)  To the extent possible, operators of cable or open video systems shall use existing poles and existing conduit in installing their system. In no case may additional poles be installed in the right-of-way without the permission of the Town; any person who is permitted to install poles must lease capacity on those poles to others, at a rate not higher than the rate that would be permitted if 47 U.S.C.  224 applied. 
(6)  Except as [the] Town may direct otherwise, cable or open video systems may be constructed overhead where poles exist and electric or lines of a local exchange carrier franchised before 1990 are overhead, but where both electric or such telephone lines are underground, or are being initially placed underground (whether voluntarily or at the Town's direction), other cable or open video systems shall be constructed underground. Whenever and wherever the owner of the poles upon which aerial facilities are located moves its plant from overhead to underground placement in an area, all cable or open video systems in that area shall be similarly moved underground. 
(7)  Any and all public rights-of-way, public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation or repair of a cable or open video system shall be promptly repaired by the cable or open video system's operator. 
(8)  Tree trimming shall be performed in strict accordance with the Town Code. 
(c)  Relocation of facilities. 
(1)  A cable or open video system operator shall, by a time specified by the Town, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the Town or any other governmental entity by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned communications or cable or open video system, public work or improvement or any government-owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the cable or open video system. Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the "public work." 
a.  Except in the case of emergencies, the Town shall provide written notice describing where the public work is to be performed at least 30 calendar days prior to the deadline by which a cable or open video system operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. A cable or open video system operator may seek an extension of the time to perform such tasks where they cannot be performed in 30 calendar days and such request for an extension shall not be unreasonably refused. 
b.  In the event of an emergency, or where a cable or open video system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the Town may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the cable or open video system without prior notice, and charge the cable or open video system operator for costs incurred. In case of such emergency, where in the judgment of the Town, conditions permit, the Town shall reasonably attempt to notify the cable or open video system operator. 
(2)  If any person that is authorized to place facilities in the right-of-way requests another cable or open video system operator receiving the request to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate its facilities to accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of such other person, the cable or open video system operator shall, after 30 calendar days' advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested. Unless the matter is governed by a valid contract or a State or Federal law or regulation, or in other cases where the cable or open video system that is being requested to move was not properly installed, the reasonable cost of the same shall be borne by the party requesting the protection, support, temporary disconnection, removal, or relocation and at no charge to the Town. 
(3)  A cable or open video system operator shall, on the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same. A cable or open video system operator shall be given not less than seven calendar days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(4)  A cable or open video system operator may abandon any property in place upon notice to the Town, unless the Town determines, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion within 90 calendar days of the notice of abandonment from the operator, that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public right-of-way and facilities in the public right-of-way will be adversely affected thereby, in which case the operator must remove its property within a reasonable period of time specified by the Town. 
(5)  If a State statute requires the Town to compensate a person for the cost of relocation or removal, nothing in this chapter shall be read to abrogate any right such person may have to that compensation. 
(d)  Facility subject to inspection; operator must provide information. Every cable or open video system shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection and testing by the Town to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter, a franchise or license agreement, or other applicable law. The Town shall have the right, upon written request, to be notified and present when the cable or open video system is tested by the operator for its semiannual FCC testing. Each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the Town may from time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated or repaired. 
(e)  Underground services alert. Each operator of a cable or open video system that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground cable or open video system upon request. The operator shall locate its facilities for the Town at no charge. 
(6)  Publicizing work. 
(1)  A cable or open video system operator shall publicize the initial build or any substantial rebuild, upgrade, or extension of its facility that involves work in public rights-of-way in each affected neighborhood at least one week prior to commencement of that work by causing written notice of such construction work to be delivered to the Town and by notifying those persons whose property is within 300 feet of the work in at least two of the following ways: by telephone, in person, by mail, by distribution of flyers to residences, by publication in local newspapers, or in any other manner reasonably calculated to provide adequate notice. Apart from any initial build or substantial rebuild or upgrade, any underground construction will be publicized in accordance with applicable notice requirements. 
In other cases, before entering onto any private property to perform work, a cable or open video system operator shall use its best efforts to contact the property owner or (in the case of residential property) the resident at least one day in advance, and describe the work to be performed. 
(2)  Each cable or open video system owner shall provide the Town a plan for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the Town that will be affected. 
(g)  No discrimination. 
(1)  A cable or open video system operator shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or residents of the Town on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, conditions of physical handicap, religion, ethnic background, marital status, or sexual orientation. 
(2)  A cable or open video system operator shall not discriminate among persons or the Town or take any retaliatory action against a person or the Town because of that entity's exercise of any right it may have under Federal, State, or local law, nor may the operator require a person or the Town to waive such rights as a condition of taking service. 
(3)  A cable or open video system operator shall not deny access or levy different rates and charges on any group of potential customers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides. 
(4)  A cable or open video system operator shall comply with all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunities, as the same may be from time to time amended. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-25. - Protection of the Town and residents. 
(a)  Indemnification. 
(1)  The Town may not enter into any franchise, or otherwise authorize any cable or open video system operator to use the public rights-of-way, until and unless the Town obtains an adequate indemnity from such operator. The indemnity must at least: 
a.  Release the Town from and against any and all liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable or open video system. 
b.  Indemnify and hold harmless the Town, its trustees, elected and appointed officers, agents, and employees, from and against any and all claims, demands, or causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable paralegal expenses, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees, sustained by the Town or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of the acts, errors, or omissions of the cable or open video system operator, or its agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the facility. 
c.  Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the indemnification provision shall survive the term of any agreement and continue in full force and effect as to the party's responsibility to indemnify. 
(b)  Insurance. The Town may not enter into any franchise, or otherwise authorize any cable or open video system operator to use the public rights-of-way, until and unless the Town obtains assurance that such operator (and those acting on its behalf) have adequate insurance. At a minimum, the following requirements must be satisfied: 
(1)  A cable or open video system operator shall not commence construction or operation of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under this section and approval of such insurance by risk management of the Town, nor shall a cable or open video system operator allow any contractor or subcontractor to commence work on its contract or subcontract until all similar such insurance required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the cable or open video system operator has facilities in the right-of-way, and for a period thereafter as specified in the minimum coverages described below. If the operator, its contractors or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the Town may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. 
(2)  Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance, shall be filed with the Risk Manager Coordinator. For entities that are entering the market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the right-of-way as of the effective date of this chapter, the certificates shall be filed within 60 calendar days of the adoption of this chapter, annually thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise agreement provides for filing of certificates in a different manner. 
(3)  These certificates of insurance shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least 30 calendar days prior written notice has been given to the Town. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the State of Florida. Financial Ratings must be no less than "A" in the latest edition of "Bests Key Rating Guide," published by A.M. Best Guide. 
(4)  In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the period of this contract, then in that event, the cable or open video system operator shall furnish, at least 30 calendar days prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage for the balance of the period of the franchise or license under which cable or open video system operates. 
(5)  A cable or open video system operator, and its contractors or subcontractors engaged in work on the operator's behalf in, on, under or over public rights-of-way, shall maintain the following minimum insurance: 
a.  Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability bodily injury and property damage. Exposures to be covered are: premises, operations, products/completed operations, and certain contracts. Coverage must be written on an occurrence basis, with the following limits of liability: 
1.  Bodily injury: 
(i)  Each occurrence ..... $1,000,000 
(ii)  Annual aggregate ..... 3,000,000 
2.  Property damage: 
(i)  Each occurrence ..... $1,000,000 
(ii)  Annual aggregate ..... 3,000,000 
3.  Personal injury: 
Annual aggregate ..... $3,000,000 
4.  Completed operations and products liability shall be maintained for two years after the termination of the franchise agreement or license agreement (in the case of the cable or open video system operator) or completion of the work for the cable or open video system operator (in the case of a contractor or subcontractor). 
5.  Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for the following hazards: X-Explosion, C-Collapse, U-Underground. 
b.  Workers' compensation insurance shall be maintained during the life of this contract to comply with statutory limits for all employees, and in the case any work is sublet, each cable or open video system operator shall require the subcontractors similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance for all the latter's employees unless such employees are covered by the protection afforded by each cable or open video system operator. Each cable or open video system operator and its contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this policy employers liability insurance. The following limits must be maintained: 
1.  Workers' Compensation .....  Statutory Limit 
2.  Employer's liability, per occurrence ..... $500,000 
c.  Comprehensive auto liability: 
1.  Bodily injury: 
(i)  Each occurrence ..... $1,000,000 
(ii)  Annual aggregate ..... 3,000,000 
2.  Property damage: 
(i)  Each occurrence ..... $1,000,000 
(ii)  Annual aggregate ..... 3,000,000 
Coverage shall include owned, hired and non-owned vehicles. 
(6)  Each cable or open video system operator shall hold the Town, its agents, and employees, harmless on account of claims for damages to persons, property or premises arising out of its construction, operation or repair of its cable or open video system and name the Town as an additional insured. 
(c)  Performance/payment bonds. Every operator of a cable or open video system may be required to obtain performance bonds and, if necessary, payment bonds to ensure the faithful performance of its responsibilities under this chapter and any franchise agreement or license for an initial build, any substantial rebuild, upgrade, or extension of its facility, or when construction plans show that there would be more than 1,000 feet of open trenching in the right-of-way at any given time. The amount of the performance and payment bonds shall be set by the Town Administrator in light of the nature of the work to be performed, and is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the Town Attorney. The Town may from time to time, increase the amount of the required performance bond to reflect increased risks to the Town and to the public. 
(d)  Security fund. Every cable or open video system operator shall establish a $25,000.00 cash security fund, or provide the Town an irrevocable letter of credit in the same amount, to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise agreement, and to pay any taxes, fees or liens owed to the Town. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the Town Attorney and Director of Financial Management. Should the Town draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, it shall promptly notify the cable or open video system operator, and the cable or open video system operator shall promptly restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by the Town for a franchisee or licensee where the Town determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee's or licensee's operations are sufficiently limited that a $25,000.00 security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. The Town may from time to time, upon reasonable notice and after the cable or open video system operator has had an opportunity to respond thereto, increase the amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect increased risks to the Town and to the public. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00)

(3)  Every application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee in amounts established from time to time by the Town Commission by resolution. 
(4)  An applicant that is awarded a franchise or license, shall pay to the Town a sum of money sufficient to reimburse it for all publication expenses incurred by it in connection with the granting of a franchise or license pursuant to the provisions of this article. Such payment shall be made within 30 calendar days after the Town furnishes the franchisee or licensee with a written statement of such expenses by delivery of same to the Town Clerk. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a franchised or licensed cable or open video system to secure the construction, operation or repair of the system may be made without application and without the Town's prior consent; except that no such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect under any condition prevent the cable or open video system operator or any successor from complying with the franchise or license and applicable law, nor may any such arrangement permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control the cable or open video system without the prior consent of the Town. Any mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the Town under this chapter or other applicable law. 
(c)  Minimum contents of every franchise or license. In addition to satisfying the other applicable requirements of article II, every franchise agreement or license for a cable or open video system shall contain the following provisions: 
(1)  The franchise agreement or license shall provide that neither the granting of any franchise or license, or any provision thereof, shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power, police power, or regulatory power of the Town as may exist at the time the franchise is issued or thereafter be obtained. 
(2)  The franchise agreement or license shall only authorize occupancy of the right-of-way to provide the services and for the purposes described in the franchise or license. 
(3)  A franchise or license shall be a privilege that is held in the public trust and personal to the original franchisee. The franchise agreement or license shall ensure that no transfer of the franchise or license may occur, directly or indirectly, without the prior consent of the Town; except as contemplated by section 26-26(b)(5). 
(4)  The franchise agreement or license shall ensure that any person placing a cable or open video system in the right-of-way will not discriminate in hiring, in contracting, or in the provision of services. 
(5)  The franchise agreement or license shall contain appropriate provisions for enforcement, compensation, and protection of the public, consistent with the other provisions of this chapter. 
(6)  The franchise or license shall be for a specified term, set forth in the franchise agreement or license. No franchise issued under this chapter shall be for a term of longer than ten years; no license issued under this chapter shall be for a term of longer than five years. 
(d)  Penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be fined for each day the violation continues in accordance with F.S. ch. 162, as amended. 
(e)  Revocation, reduction of term, or forfeiture of franchise or license. 
(1)  Licenses shall be revocable at the will of the Town Commission. 
(2)  Where, after notice and providing the franchisee an opportunity to be heard (if such opportunity is timely requested by a franchisee), the Town finds that the facility is being operated in violation of this chapter or substantial violation of the terms of the franchise agreement, the Town may make an appropriate reduction in the remaining term of the franchise or to revoke the franchise. The Town Administrator is authorized to establish and conduct a proceeding that comports with the requirements of this section, and to issue a recommended decision, but any such decision may be appealed to the Town Commission. Any appeal must be filed within 30 calendar days of the decision of the Town Administrator or it shall be deemed waived. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchise may not be revoked unless the franchisee: 
1.  As given notice of the default; 
2.  As given 30 calendar days to cure the default; and 
3.  Failed to cure the default, or to propose a schedule for curing the default acceptable to the Town where it is impossible to cure the default in 30 calendar days. 
The required notice may be given before the Town conducts the proceeding required by this section. No opportunity to cure is required for repeated violations, and fraud shall be deemed incurable. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Town may declare a franchise forfeited where the franchisee; 
a.  Fails to begin to exercise its rights under the franchise within a period specified in the franchise agreement; 
b.  Stops providing service it is required to provide in the franchise; 
c.  Without the prior consent of the Town, transfers the franchise; or 
d.  Fails to pay any fees required hereunder, including, but not limited to, application fees, permit fees, or franchise fees. 
(4)  The Town shall give a franchisee 30 calendar days notice of an intent to declare a franchise forfeited, and shall provide the franchisee an opportunity to show cause why the franchise should not be forfeited. 
(5)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any franchise may, at the option of the Town following a public hearing before the Town Commission, be revoked 120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that 120 calendar day period: 
a.  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or 
b.  Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the Town may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the Town Commission, by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless: 
a.  The Town has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and 
b.  The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the Town to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this chapter. 
(f)  Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a license or franchise, whether by action of the Town as provided above, or by passage of time, the franchisee or licensee shall be obligated to cease using the cable or open video system for the purposes authorized by the franchise. The Town may either take possession of some or all of the licensee's or franchisee's facilities in the public rights-of-way after furnishing the cable or open video system operator with written notice and granting the cable or open video system operator a reasonable period of time, but in no event more than 30 calendar days, to remove same, or require the licensee or franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the licensee's or franchisee's facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to their proper condition. Should the franchisee or licensee neglect, refuse, or fail to remove such facility, the Town may remove the facility at the expense of the franchisee or licensee. The obligation of the licensee or franchisee to remove shall survive the termination of the franchise or license for a period of two years. Provided that, the Town may not take possession of, or require the franchisee or licensee to remove, any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the franchisee holds a valid franchise or license issued by the Town. 
(g)  Remedies cumulative. All remedies under this chapter and any franchise agreement are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a cable or open video system operator of its obligations to comply with its franchise. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; in addition, the Town may exercise any rights it has at law or equity. Recovery by the Town of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a cable or open video system operator's duty to indemnify the Town in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a cable or open video system operator of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the Town, or in any respect prevent the Town from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. Nothing herein shall be read to authorize the double-recovery of damages. 
(h)  Access to books and records. 
(1)  Each cable or open video system operator shall, upon 30 calendar days, if reasonably possible, but in no event less than five business days written notice, provide the Town access to all books and records related to the construction, operation, or repair of the cable or open video system so that the Town may inspect these books and records. Any and all non-proprietary or non-confidential books and records may be copied by the Town. The operators' obligation includes the obligation to produce all books and records related to revenues derived from the operation of the cable or open video system. An operator is responsible for obtaining or maintaining the necessary possession or control of all books and records related to the construction, operation or repair of the cable or open video system, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records must be maintained for a period of five years, except that any record that is a public record must be maintained for the period required by State law; and a franchise may specify a shorter period for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the information contained therein can be derived simply from other materials. 
(2)  For purposes of this chapter, the terms "books and records" shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored. Books and records requested shall be produced to the Town at Town Hall, except by agreement or pursuant to subsection 26-26(h)(3). 
(3)  If any books and records are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied and moved, then a cable or open video system operator may request that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to by the Town and the operator, provided that the operator must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by the Town after its review; and the operator must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the Town in inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its designee. 
(4)  Without limiting the foregoing, the operator of a cable or open video system shall provide the Town the following within ten calendar days of their receipt or (in the case of documents created by the operator or its affiliate) filing: 
a.  Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the cable or open video system; and 
b.  Copies of any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the franchisee directly or indirectly. 
(i)  Retention of records; relation to privacy rights. Each cable or open video system operator shall take all reasonable steps required, if any, to ensure that it is able to provide the Town all information which must be provided or may be requested under this chapter, a franchise agreement, or applicable law, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each operator shall be responsible for reacting any data that applicable law prevents it from providing to the Town. Nothing in this section shall be read to require an operator to violate State or Federal law protecting subscriber privacy.

(n)  No waiver. The failure of the Town to insist on timely performance or compliance by any person holding a license or franchise shall not constitute a waiver of the Town's right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that person or any other person holding such a license or franchise. 
(o)  Ordinance not a contract. The Town expressly reserves the right to amend this chapter from time to time in the exercise of its lawful powers. This and any ordinance adopting provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to be a contract.

DIVISION 2. - SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEM OPERATORS 

Sec. 26-41. - Application for a franchise. 
(a)  Contents of application for initial or renewal franchise. In order to obtain an initial or renewal franchise, an operator of an open video system must apply for a franchise. The application must contain the following information, and such information as the Town may from time to time require. 
(1)  Identity of the applicant; the persons who exercise working control over the applicant and the persons who control those persons, to the ultimate parent. 
(2)  A proposal for construction of the open video system that sets forth at least the following: 
a.  A description of the services that are to be provided over the facility. 
b.  The location of proposed facility and facility design, including a description of the miles of plant to be installed, where it is to be located, and the size of facilities and equipment that will be located in, on, over, or above the rights-of-way. 
c.  Identification of the area of the Town to be served by the proposed system, including a description of the proposed franchise area's boundaries. 
(3)  A description of the manner in which the system will be installed, and the time required to construct the system, and the expected effect on right-of-way usage, including information on the ability of the rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system, including, as appropriate given the system proposed, an estimate of the availability of space in conduits and an estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities. 
(4)  A description, where appropriate, of how services will be converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done with existing facilities. 
(5)  Proof in the form of financial statements, attested to by a certified public accountant, that the applicant has the financial resources to complete the proposed project, and to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility over the franchise term. It is not the intent of the Town to require an applicant to prove that the services it proposed to offer will succeed in the marketplace. 
(6)  Proof that applicant is technically qualified to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility. At a minimum, the applicant must show that it has experience or resources to ensure that work is to be performed adequately, and can respond to emergencies during and after construction is complete. 
(7)  Proof that the applicant is legally qualified, which proof must include a demonstration that the applicant: 
a.  Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary authorization from State and Federal authorities; 
b.  Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows [the] Town to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of franchise, or provisions of this article; 
c.  Was not a convicted vendor 36 months or fewer prior to the date of the application pursuant to F.S. ch. 287, or was removed from the convicted vendor list pursuant to F.S.  287.133; 
d.  Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those relating to the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities, and has not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so. 
(8)  An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law. 
(b)  Additional information regarding affiliates; presumptions. To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the proofs required by subsections 26-41(a)(3)-(5) should be provided for that person. An applicant will be presumed to have the requisite financial, or technical or legal qualifications to the extent such qualifications have been reviewed and approved by a State agency of competent jurisdiction; or if applicant is a holder of a franchise in the Town for a cable system or open video system, and conduct under such other franchise provides no basis for additional investigation. 
(c)  Applications for transfer. An application for a transfer of a franchise must contain same information required by subsection 26-54(a), except that, if the transferor submitted an application pursuant to subsection 26-54(a), to the extent information provided by the transferor under subsection 26-54(a)(2) remains accurate, the transferee may simply cross-reference the earlier application. 
(d)  Town review. The Town may request such additional information as it finds necessary, and require such modifications to the application as may be necessary in the exercise of the Town's authority over open video systems. Once the information required by the Town has been provided, the application shall be promptly reviewed and shall be granted if the Town finds that: 
(1)  The applicant has the qualifications to construct, operate and repair the system proposed in conformity with applicable law. The Town shall provide a reasonable opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under section 26-41(a)(7)b., by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of an open video system. An application for a franchise area shall not be granted if the franchisee has no plans for constructing a system within the entire area for which the franchise is sought. 
(2)  The applicant accepts the modifications required by the Town to its proposed system. This section shall not be read to authorize the Town to exercise authority it does not otherwise have under applicable law. 
(3)  The applicant enters into a franchise agreement and complies with any conditions precedent to its effectiveness. 
(4)  In the case of a transfer, the Town must also determine that: 
a.  There will be no adverse effect on the public interest, or the Town's interest in the franchise; 
b.  Transferee agrees to be bound by all the conditions of the franchise and to assume all the obligations of its predecessor; and 
c.  Any outstanding compliance and compensation issues are resolved or preserved to the satisfaction of the Town. 
(5)  An applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files, or in the previous three years, filed materially misleading information in a franchise application; or intentionally withheld information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide. 
(e)  Compensation. Every operator of an open video system shall pay compensation to the Town as follows: 
(1)  To the extent that the system is used to provide cable services: a percentage of gross revenues (as that term is defined in division 3 of this article as if the open video system operator were a cable operator) each quarter equal to the gross revenue percentage paid by any cable operator for the same quarter. In addition, unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, an open video system operator shall pay to the Town, at a time directed by the Town, an amount equal to the highest amount contributed by any cable operator under its franchise for and in support of public, educational and government use (including institutional network use) of its cable system. To the extent that a cable operator is providing other support for public, educational or governmental use, the operator must duplicate that support within a time and in a manner directed by the Town, or provide a cash equivalent acceptable to the Town. In applying this section, the Town shall ensure that the obligations borne by the open video system operator are no greater or lesser than the obligation imposed upon the cable operator providing the greatest benefits to the community. The compensation required under this section or specified in a franchise shall increase as the compensation that a cable operator is required to provide (in cash and in other forms) increases. 
(2)  To the extent that the open video system is used for the provision of telecommunications services, the open video system operator shall pay the fee required of a telecommunications service provider. 
(3)  Such other compensation as the Town may charge in the future, consistent with Federal or State law, including fees imposed upon open video system lessees. 
(f)  Customer service standard certification. An open video system that enters into an agreement to comply with the customer service standards applicable to cable systems may be certified by the Town as "Consumer Friendly Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea" for so long as it complies with those requirements. 
(g)  Every cable or open video system and every cable or open video system operator shall be required to interconnect with every other cable or open video system and cable or open video system operator within the Town on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of providing PEG and I-Net services.

Secs. 26-42-26-50. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS 

Sec. 26-51. - Definitions. 
    Access channel means any capacity on a cable system set aside by a franchisee for public, educational, or governmental use. 
    Basic cable service or basic service means any service tier that includes the retransmission of local television broadcast signals. 
    Cable Act means the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C.  521 et seq., as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, as further amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as further amended from time to time. 
    Equitable price means fair market value adjusted downward for the harm to the Town or subscribers, if any, resulting from a franchisee's breach of its franchise agreement or violation of this chapter and as further adjusted to account for other equitable factors that may be considered consistent with 47 U.S.C.  547. 
    Fair market value means the price for the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. 
    Governmental access channel means any capacity on a cable system set aside by a franchisee for government use. 
    Gross revenues means any and all cash or other consideration of any cable operator of a cable system in any way derived from the operation of that cable system to provide cable services in the franchise area. Gross revenues include, by way of illustration and not limitation, monthly fees charged subscribers for any basic, optional, premium, per-channel, or per-program service; installation, disconnection, reconnection, and change-in-service fees; leased channel fees; late fees and administrative fees; revenues received from programmers for carriage of programming on the cable system (excluding money received from programmers which is passed through to offset the cost of launching the service including equipment expense and cost, advertising expense as well as other pass through incomes for advertising or marketing such programming); revenues from rentals or sales of converters or other equipment; advertising revenues; revenues from program guides; and revenues from home shopping channels. Home shopping revenue shall be based on the number of homes in a zip code area provided that where a common zip code serves more than one Town, the revenues from that zip code shall be allocated based on the number of homes in the zip code area attributable to the Town divided by the total homes in the zip code area. This provision shall be read broadly to prevent the avoidance of franchise fees by a cable operator through arrangements with affiliates. Gross revenues shall not include any taxes on services furnished by a franchisee which are imposed directly on any subscriber or user by the State, Town, or other governmental unit and which are collected by a franchisee on behalf of said governmental unit: bad debt expense; subscriber deposits in segregated accounts; or copyright fees. If an amount written off as bad debt is recovered, or if a deposit is applied to unpaid service revenues, said amount shall be included in the gross revenue base. 
    Non-cable service means any service that is authorized to be distributed over the cable system, other than a cable service. 
    Public access channel means any capacity on a cable system set aside by a franchisee for use by the general public, including groups and individuals, and which is available for such use on a non-discriminatory basis. 
    Service tier means a package of two or more cable services for which a separate charge is made by the franchisee, other than a package of premium and pay-per-view services that is not subject to rate regulation under the Cable Act and applicable FCC regulations because those services are also sold on a true a la carte basis. 
    Subscriber means the Town, any government entity or any person who legally receives any cable service from a cable operator delivered over that cable operator's cable system. 
    User means a person or the Town utilizing a channel, capacity or equipment and facilities for purposes of producing or transmitting material, as contrasted with the receipt thereof in the capacity of a subscriber. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-52. - No exclusivity. 
    A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager to enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing service. However, nothing herein prevents a franchisee from entering into an otherwise lawful, mutually desired exclusive arrangement with a building owner or manager of a multiple-dwelling unit or commercial subscriber. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-53. - Relation to 47 U.S.C.,  545, 546. 
    This division shall be read and applied so that it is consistent with Sections 625 and 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C.  545-546.

Sec. 26-54. - Applications for grant, renewal, or modification of franchise.

(b)  Contents of applications. A request for proposals for a franchise, including for a renewal franchise under 47 U.S.C.  546(c), shall require, and any application submitted pursuant to this section (and expressly not an informal renewal application submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  546(h)) shall contain, at a minimum, the following information. 
(1)  Identity of the applicant, the persons who exercise working control over the applicant, and the persons who control those persons, to the ultimate parent.

c.  Pro forma financial projections for the proposed franchise term, including a statement of projected income, and a schedule of planned capital additions, with all significant assumptions explained in notes or supporting schedules. 
(6)  A demonstration of the applicant's technical ability to construct and/or operate the proposed cable system. 
(7)  Proof that the applicant is legally qualified, which proof must include a demonstration that the applicant: 
a.  Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary authorizations from State and Federal authorities; 
b.  Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows [the] Town to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of franchise, or provisions of this article; 
c.  Was not a convicted vendor 36 months or fewer prior to the date of the application pursuant to F.S. ch. 287, or was removed from the convicted vendor list pursuant to F.S.  287.133; 
d.  Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those relating to the construction, operation or repair of its facilities; and has not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so; and 
e.  The applicant must not have submitted an application for an initial or renewal franchise to the Town, which was denied on the ground that the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application. 
The Town shall provide a reasonable opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under subsection 26-54(e)(7)2., by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system. 
(8)  To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the proofs required pursuant to subsections 26-54(b)(5) and (6) should be provided for that person. 
(9)  A description of the applicant's prior experience in cable system ownership, construction, and operation, and identification of cities and counties in Florida in which the applicant or any of its principals have a cable franchise or any interest therein, provided that an applicant that holds a franchise for the Town and is seeking renewal of that franchise need only provide this information for other cities and counties in Florida where its franchise is scheduled to expire during the 12-month period prior to the date its application is submitted to the Town and for other cities and counties in Florida where its franchise had been scheduled to expire during the 12-month period after the date its application is submitted to the Town. If an applicant has no other franchise in Florida, it shall provide the information for its operations in other states. 
(10)  An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law. 
(c)  Procedure for applying for grant of a franchise, other than a Cable Act renewal franchise. 
(1)  A person may apply for a franchise in response to a request for proposals ("RFP") issued by the Town. Any response to an RFP shall contain the information required by subsection 26-54(b), and such other information as the RFP may require, and must be submitted in accordance with the restrictions in the RFP. A properly filed response to an RFP shall be evaluated in accordance with subsection 26-54(c)(3). The Town may conduct such investigations from time to time as may be appropriate to establish RFP requirements. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 26-54(c)(1), a person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application containing the information required in subsection 26-54(b) and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to subsection 26-54(c)(3). Prior to evaluating that application, the Town may conduct such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set forth in subsection 26-54(c)(3), including by commencing a proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the community. It also may seek additional applications prior to evaluating the application. An applicant for an initial franchise shall be provided an opportunity to amend its application in light of the result of any investigation conducted by the Town, prior to evaluation of that application pursuant to subsection 26-54(c)(3). 
(3)  In evaluating an application for a franchise, the Town shall consider, among other things, the following factors: 
a.  The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise for the Town; 
b.  Whether the quality of the applicant's service under any existing franchise in the Town, including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like, has been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served; 
c.  Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to hold a cable franchise; 
d.  Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the Town under this article or in the RFP or and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests; 
e.  Whether, to the extent not considered as part of subsection 26-54(c)(3)d., the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental use capacity, facilities, or financial support; 
f.  Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the rights-of-way and private property that would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the rights-of-way; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications; and 
g.  Whether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the Town. 
(4)  If the Town finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set forth above, and subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise agreement, it shall issue a franchise. If the Town denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the Town shall hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received as required by State or Federal statute. The Town also may grant a franchise based on its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. 
(d)  Procedure for applying for grant of a Cable Act renewal franchise. Requests for renewal under the Cable Act shall be received and reviewed in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C.  546. It is the proposal submitted by a franchisee under 47 U.S.C.  546(b), and not the request for commencement of the renewal proceedings submitted under 47 U.S.C.  546(a), that must contain the information required under subsection 26-54(b). If neither a franchisee nor the Town activates in a timely manner, or can activate the renewal process set forth in 47 U.S.C.  546(a)-(g) (including, for example, if the provisions are repealed), and except as to applications submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  546(h), the provisions of subsection 26-54(c) shall apply and a renewal request shall be evaluated using the same criteria as any other request for a franchise. The following requirements shall apply to renewal requests properly submitted pursuant to the Cable Act: 
(1)  If the provisions of 47 U.S.C.  546(a)-(g) are properly invoked, the Town shall issue an RFP after conducting a proceeding to review the franchisee's past performance and to identify future cable-related community needs and interests. The Town shall make available for review by a franchisee the results of the Town's review and ascertainment proceedings. The Town shall establish deadlines and procedures for responding to the RFP, may seek additional information from the franchisee related to the Town's evaluation of the proposal given the standards for review of that proposal under applicable law, and shall establish deadlines for the submission of that additional information. Following receipt of the application responding to that RFP (and such additional information as may be provided in response to requests), the Town Commission will determine that the franchise should be renewed, or make a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act applicable to that preliminary decision. The preliminary determination shall be made by resolution. If the Town Commission determines that the franchise should not be renewed, and the franchisee notifies the Town, either in its RFP response or within 30 business days of the preliminary assessment, that it wishes to pursue any rights to an administrative proceeding it has under the Cable Act, then the Town shall commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt public notice thereof, in accordance with the Cable Act. If the Town Commission decides preliminary to grant renewal, it shall prepare a final franchise agreement that incorporates, as appropriate, the commitments made by the franchisee in the application. If the franchisee accepts the franchise agreement, and the final agreement is approved by the Town Commission, the franchise shall be renewed. If the franchise agreement is not so accepted and approved within the time limits established by 47 U.S.C.  546(c)(1), renewal shall be deemed preliminarily denied, and an administrative proceeding commenced if the franchisee requests it within 30 business days of the expiration of the time limit established by 47 U.S.C.  546(c)(1), unless the time limit is extended by mutual agreement of the Town and the franchisee. 
(2)  If an administrative hearing is commenced pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  546(c), the franchisee's application shall be evaluated considering such matters as may be considered consistent with Federal law. The following procedures shall apply: 
a.  The proceeding shall be conducted with all deliberate speed in accordance with such lawful procedures as the Town may adopt by resolution. 
b.  The Town Commission may appoint an administrative Hearing Officer or officers or may conduct the administrative hearing itself. The entity that will conduct the administrative hearing is referred to as "Hearing Officer." 
c.  The Hearing Officer shall establish a schedule for proceeding. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to require the production of evidence from any person as the interests of justice may require. Any order regarding the production of evidence may be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction or by imposing appropriate sanctions in the administrative hearing. 
d.  The Hearing Officer may conduct a pre-hearing conference and establish appropriate pre-hearing orders. Intervention by non-parties is not authorized except to the extent required by the Cable Act. 
e.  The Hearing Officer shall require the Town and the franchisee to submit prepared testimony prior to the hearing. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the franchisee shall present evidence first, and the Town shall present evidence second. 
f.  Any reports or the transcript or summary of any proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  546(a) shall be, for purposes of the administrative hearing, regarded no differently than any other evidence. The Town and the franchisee shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation in the proceeding, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection 47 U.S.C.  546(a)), to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. 
g.  Following completion of any hearing, the Hearing Officer shall require the parties to submit proposed findings of fact with respect to the matters that the Town is entitled to consider in determining whether renewal ought to be granted. Based on the entire record of the administrative hearing, the Hearing Officer shall then prepare written findings, and submit those findings to the Town Commission and to the parties (unless the Hearing Officer is the Town Commission, in which case the written findings shall constitute the final decision of the Town). 
h.  If the Hearing Officer is not the Town Commission, the parties shall have 30 calendar days from the date the findings are submitted to the Town Commission to file exceptions to those findings. The Town Commission shall thereafter issue a written decision granting or denying the application for renewal, consistent with the requirements of the Cable Act and based on the record of such proceeding. A copy of the final decision of the Town Commission shall be provided promptly to the applicant. 
(e)  Informal applications for renewal. Notwithstanding the above, a cable operator may submit a proposal for renewal of a franchise pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  546(h) at any time, and the Town may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal. An application shall not be granted unless the Town determines that it is in the public interest to do so. An application may be denied for any reason, without prejudice to the applicant's right to seek renewal under other provisions of section 26-54. 
(f)  Application for modification of a franchise. 
(1)  An application for modification of a franchise agreement shall include, at minimum, the following information: 
a.  The specific modification requested; 
b.  The justification for the requested modification, including the impact of the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the financial impact on the applicant if the modification is approved or disapproved, demonstrated through, inter alia, submission of pro forma financial statements.

(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-55. - Construction provisions. 
(a)  System construction schedule. Every franchise agreement shall specify the construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuild of the cable system. The schedule shall provide for prompt completion of the project, considering the amount and type of construction required. 
(b)  Use of franchisee facilities. The Town shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge upon any poles or in any conduit owned by a franchisee any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the franchisee. Provided that, if the Town uses a franchisee's conduit or poles to install a cable system that competes with that franchisee in the provision of cable service to residential subscribers, the franchise agreement may provide that the franchisee may charge the Town a fair market rate pursuant to that franchise agreement. Franchisee shall notify the Town when it enters into an agreement for use of its poles and conduits. Copies of agreements for use of franchisee's conduits or poles in the public rights-of-way or on other public property shall be available for review upon the Town's request. A franchise agreement may include a provision under which the Town shall indemnify, defend and hold a franchisee harmless for all claims arising out of the Town's use of that franchisee's poles and conduits where the franchisee and the Town do not have a joint pole or conduit use agreement. 
(c)  Provision of service/quality of service. In addition to satisfying such requirements as may be established in a franchise, every cable system shall be subject to the following conditions, except as prohibited by Federal law: 
(1)  It is the policy of the Town to ensure that every franchisee provide service in the franchise area upon request to any person or any government building. Each franchisee shall extend service upon request within its franchise area, provided that, a franchise agreement may permit a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to contribute a fair share of the capital costs of installation or extension as a condition of extension or installation in cases where such extension or installation may be unduly expensive. Service must be provided within time limits specified in subsection 26-55(c)(2). 
(2)  Except as a franchise agreement otherwise provides, a franchisee must extend service to any person or to any government building in the franchise area which requests it within seven business days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop; within 90 calendar days of the request where an extension of one-half mile or less is required; or within six months where an extension of one-half mile or more is required. Provided that, in cases where a franchise agreement permits a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to bear a share of extension or installation costs, and franchisee requires the potential subscriber to bear such costs, the time for extension shall be measured from the date the subscriber agrees to bear such costs or, if a franchisee requires prepayment of all or a portion of the estimated costs, from the date the prepayment is made. A franchisee that requires a potential subscriber to bear a portion of installation or extension costs must prepare a written estimate of extension costs within seven business days of a request for an installation or extension that would be subject to cost-sharing. 
(3)  Any cable system within the Town shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R.  76.601 and any other applicable technical standards. 
(4)  A franchisee shall perform all tests necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement and other technical and performance standards established by applicable law. Unless a franchise agreement or applicable law provides otherwise, all tests shall be conducted in accordance with Federal rules and in accordance with the most recent edition of National Cable Television Association's "Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems," or such other manual as may be directed under FCC regulations. A written report of any test results shall be filed with the Town within seven calendar days of a request by the Town. If a location fails to meet technical or performance specifications, the franchisee, without requirement of additional notice or request from Town, shall promptly take corrective action, and retest the locations. 
(5)  Every cable or open video system and every cable or open video system operator shall be required to interconnect with every other cable or open video system and cable or open video system operator within the Town on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of providing PEG and I-Net services. 
(d)  System maintenance. Scheduled maintenance shall be performed so as to minimize the effect of any necessary interruptions of cable service. 
(e)  Continuity of service. Each franchise agreement shall, during the term of the franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous service and that, in the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be obligated to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00)

j.  Notwithstanding the above, once the information required by subsection 26-56(b)(2)d.-f. has been filed once, it need only be re-filed if it changes. 
(c)  Records required. A franchisee shall at all times maintain: 
(1)  Records of all complaints service calls received with information sufficient to allow the franchisee to prepare the reports required in this section; the term "complaints" as used herein and throughout this chapter refers to complaints about any aspect of the cable system or franchisee's operations, including, without limitation, complaints requiring service calls, and complaints about employee courtesy, billing, prices, programming, outages and signal quality;

Sec. 26-57. - Rate regulation and consumer protection.

(b)  Rate regulation procedures. Rate regulation shall be performed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the FCC. The Town Administrator, or his designee, may take any required steps to file complaints, toll rates, issue accounting orders or take any other steps required to comply with FCC regulations. The Town Commission shall be responsible for issuing final rate orders that establish rates or order refunds. No rate may be put into effect without the prior review and approval of the Town, except as Federal law may otherwise require. 
(c)  Rate discrimination prohibited. Except to the extent the Town may not enforce such a requirement, a franchisee is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the franchise area; and a franchisee may offer discounts for the elderly, the disabled, or the economically disadvantaged; and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under Federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all applicable Federal, State, and Town laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to non-discrimination. 
(d)  Cable consumer protection standards. Each franchisee must satisfy cable consumer protection standards established by the Town from time to time by ordinance or by resolution.

Sec. 26-59. - Transfers. 
(a)  Town approval required. No transfer shall occur without prior written notice to and approval of the Town Commission. Transfer without the prior written approval of the Town shall be considered to impair the Town's assurance of due performance. The granting of approval for a transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer. 
(b)  Application. 
(1)  The franchisee shall promptly notify the Town of any proposed transfer. If any transfer should take place without prior notice to the Town, the franchisee will promptly notify the Town that such a transfer has occurred. 
(2)  At least 120 calendar days prior to the contemplated effective date of a transfer, the franchisee shall submit to the Town an application for approval of the transfer. Such an application shall provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a minimum, the following information must be included in the application, provided that, a franchisee is not required to duplicate information that it submits to the Town to comply with its obligations under Federal or State law: 
a.  All information and forms required under Federal law or the equivalent of such forms if no longer required by Federal law; 
b.  All information required in subsections 26-54(b)(1) and 26-54(b)(5)-(10) of this chapter; 
c.  Any contracts or other documents that relate to the proposed transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits, or the like referred to therein to the extent that such documentation is required by the FCC; 
d.  Any shareholder reports or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that discuss the transaction; 
e.  Other information necessary to provide a complete and accurate understanding of the financial position of the cable system before and after the proposed transfer; 
f.  Complete information regarding any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service; 
g.  A brief summary of the proposed transferee's plans for at least the next five years regarding line extension, plant and equipment upgrades, channel capacity, expansion or elimination of services, and any other changes affecting or enhancing the performance of the cable system. 
(3)  For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer, the Town or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the prospective transferee and such other matters as the Town may deem necessary to determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be approved, denied, or conditioned as provided under subsection 26-59(c) of this chapter. The franchisee and any prospective transferees shall assist the Town in any such inquiry, and if they fail to do so, the request for transfer may be denied. 
(c)  Determination by Town. In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer of a franchise, the Town shall consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the Town, and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the Town; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the Town's interest under this chapter, the franchise agreement, or other applicable law. 
(d)  Transferee's agreement. Subject to any transitional provisions that may apply, no application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee under this chapter and the franchise agreement for all purposes, including renewal, unless the Town, in its sole discretion, expressly waives this requirement in whole or in part. 
(e)  Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the Town of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the Town under this chapter or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(f)  Exception for intra-company transfers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchise agreement may provide that transfers to affiliates of a franchisee shall be excepted from the requirements of subsection 26-59(a) and (b) where the affiliate is wholly-owned and managed by an entity that will guarantee the performance under a franchise agreement; and, subject to any transitional provisions that may apply the transferee affiliate: 
(1)  Notifies the Town of the transfer at least 60 calendar days before it occurs and, at that time provides the agreements and warranties required by this section, describes the nature of the transfer, and submits complete information describing who will have direct and indirect ownership and control of the cable system after the transfer; 
(2)  Warrants that it has read, accepts and agrees to be bound by each and every term of the franchise and related amendment, regulations, ordinances and resolutions then in effect; 
(3)  Agrees to assume all responsibility for all liabilities, acts and omissions known and unknown of its predecessor franchisees for all purposes, including renewal; 
(4)  Agrees that the transfer shall not permit it take any position or exercise any right which could not have been exercised by its predecessor franchisees; 
(5)  Warrants that the transfer will not substantially increase the financial burdens upon or substantially diminish the financial resources available to the franchisee (the warranty to be based on comparing the burdens upon and resources that will be available to the transferee compared to its predecessors), or otherwise adversely affect the ability of the franchisee to perform; 
(5)  Warrants that the transfer will not in any way adversely affect the Town or subscribers (including by increasing rates); 
(7)  Notifies the Town that the transfer is complete within five business days of the date the transfer is complete; and 
(8)  Agrees that the transfer in no way affects any evaluation of its legal, financial or technical qualifications that may occur under the franchise or applicable law after the transfer, and does not directly or indirectly authorize any additional transfers. 
(Ord. No. 440,  2, 6-27-00) 
Sec. 26-60. - Connections to cable system; use of antennae. 
(a)  Subscriber right to attach. To the extent consistent with Federal law, subscribers shall have the right to attach VCR receivers and other terminal equipment to a franchisee's cable system to receive services for which they paid. Subscribers also shall have the right to use their own remote control devices and converters, and other similar equipment to receive services for which they paid. 
(b)  Removal of existing antennae. A franchisee shall not, as a condition of providing service, require a subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna, or disconnect an antenna except at the express direction of the subscriber or potential subscriber, provided that such antenna is connected with an appropriate device and complies with applicable law.

DIVISION 1. - ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 30-51. - Architectural review standards. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section and the Town's Architectural Design Standards (sometimes referred to as the "Town ADS") is to encourage the local adaptation of the Mid-Century Modern architectural style as the preferred architectural style of the Town, in that such architectural style is compatible with the essential character of the Town, supportive of efficient development, is architecturally and visually appealing, and fosters a sense of place in the preservation of the architectural and design characteristics of the Town's existing built environment. 
(b)  Incorporation by reference of Town Architectural Design Standards. The Town Architectural Design Standards manual (also known as the Town ADS manual), as adopted by resolution of the Town Commission and as may be amended from time to time, is hereby incorporated into this article II, division 1. Architectural Review Requirements. All provisions of this section shall be interpreted in conformance with the Town ADS. In the event of conflict between the ADS and the Code, the Code governs. 
(c)  Applicability. 
(1)  The following shall be reviewed for compliance with the architectural standards and architectural review requirements provided by this section and the Town ADS: 
a.  All development, including new construction, reconstruction, alterations and additions within the B-1-A, B-1, RM-25, and RM-50 Town zoning districts; 
b.  The exterior renovation, rebuilding, or restoration of a duplex unit, consistent with the requirements of section 30-137(d) for consistency in form and style with the remaining duplex unit to which the reconstructed duplex unit will be attached; 
c.  An application for a COA for any exterior construction or alteration, relocation or demolition of a designated historic structure or site, or a contributing structure in a historic district. 
(2)  Alterations and additions to existing buildings with design elements that are associated with the Mid-Century Modern style of architecture shall conform to that architectural style. 
(3)  Alterations and additions to existing buildings with design elements that are not associated with the Mid-Century Modern style of architecture shall conform to the architectural style of the existing building. 
(4)  The Town ADS further defines the requirements of the Mid-Century Modern style and alternative architectural styles, and the various elements of design that are encouraged and discouraged in the Town. 
(d)  Architectural styles. 
(1)  Mid-Century Modern. The preferred architectural style of the Town shall be in accordance with the Mid-Century Modern or similar harmonious architecture, except that any buildings the Town Commission has designated as a "historical landmark" shall conform to the architecture of the existing building. 
(2)  Alternative architectural styles. 
a.  While the Mid-Century Modern architectural style is the Town's preferred architectural style, it is not intended to be the exclusive architectural style of the Town. Alternative architectural styles and design concepts may be considered during the development review process. However, it shall be the applicant's burden to show that the proposed alternative architectural style and design concepts, to the maximum extent practical, are compatible with the architectural style of adjacent existing or approved development on the same or adjacent properties and street frontages. 
b.  Alternative architectural styles may be considered appropriate if it is found that: 
1.  The proposed alternative style is compatible with the architectural style of adjacent existing or approved development on the same or adjacent property; and 
2.  The architectural style of proposed development incorporates a scale, massing, and sufficient number of the same or similar design elements (e.g., horizontal or vertical building facade articulation, building facade articulation elements, facade materials, roof design, use and design of balconies, window design, door design, use and design of window or door shading devices, railing design, etc.) to create a clear and affirmative relationship or transition between the architectural styles of existing buildings or of approved development on the same or adjacent properties and street frontages. 
c.  "Adjacent," when used herein, shall mean a lot or parcel of land that shares all or part of a common lot line with another lot or parcel of land, or a lot or parcel of land that is separated from another lot or parcel of land by a right-of-way or park. 
(e)  Review of architectural design. 
(1)  To ensure that any application for a development approval or permit, as required by this chapter, complies with architectural design review provisions, the Town Manager shall: 
a.  Designate staff with appropriate levels of education or expertise; and/or 
b.  Retain the services of a consultant with appropriate levels of education or expertise. 
(2)  If the Town Manager retains the services of a consultant to conduct the architectural design review, then the Town shall recover the costs for such services in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  The primary purpose of the architectural design review shall be: 
a.  To determine whether or not the plans submitted comply with the architectural design features and materials typical of the Mid-Century Modern architectural style. Alternatively, if the plans submitted are of an alternative architectural style that complies with the requirements of the Town ADS, to determine whether those plans comply with the architectural design features and materials typical of that style; and 
b.  To suggest to the applicant such changes as may be necessary to bring the plans into conformity with the relevant architectural style. 
(f)  Compliance with all other applicable code provisions. 
(1)  The plans and specifications required to be submitted for the proposed development approval or permit shall be designed in accordance with all other applicable code provisions. 
(2)  In the architectural design review, compliance with all applicable building and life-safety codes shall prevail over any conflicting provisions of other applicable codes or standards. 
(g)  Application for architectural design review. An application for architectural design review shall be submitted to the Department on a form provided by the Town with such exhibits as may be required by the Town, accompanied by a fee to be provided by resolution. 
(h)  Approval of architectural design. The Town shall determine whether the plans submitted substantially conform to the provisions of this section and the Town ADS in preserving the traditional aesthetic treatment of the community, and shall include such findings as part of the documentation required for development review and approval. 
(i)  Revisions to approved plans. Modification to the approved plans shall be subject to the provisions for modifications to approved site plans as provided in section 30-123. 
(j)  Appeals. The applicant may appeal the administrative determination regarding the compliance of plans submitted for a development permit with the provisions of this section and the Town ADS, as follows: 
(1)  Process for review and hearing of appeals. Appeals shall be submitted to the Town Commission on a form provided by the Town accompanied by a fee to be provided by resolution. 
(2)  Timing and components of appeal. All appeals shall be filed within 30 days of the administrative determination of compliance or non-compliance. The appeal shall be based on the application file and plans submitted up to the date of the determination being appealed, including the Architectural Design Review Report and any relevant documents, and the applicant's appeal form and the staff's response thereto. 
(3)  Appeal hearings. The Town Commission shall consider the appeal on the record at a regularly scheduled public meeting held within 55 calendar days of the filing date of the appeal. Arguments may be made to the Town Commission supporting or opposing the appeal, but no additional written information or testimony, beyond a procedural history provided by staff, shall be submitted at the hearing by the applicant or the Town staff/consultant. 
(4)  Decisions on appeals. The Town Commission may approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or deny the application. Approval with modifications or conditions shall be subject to further Town review of revised plans for compliance with the modifications or conditions imposed by the Town Commission. For the purpose of appeal, the Town Commission's decision shall be considered a final development order.

DIVISION 2. - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 30-71. - Development review standards. 
(a)  Conformity with the Comprehensive Plan. The development review criteria contained herein shall be construed and applied to be consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the Town's adopted Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  Consistency with site development plan requirements. Development shall be consistent with the site development plan requirements of article IV, division 2, Site Plan Procedures and Requirements, of this chapter. 
(c)  Review for adequacy of public services and facilities. A development application in the Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea must comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Adequacy of transportation network. The adequacy of the transportation network shall be determined based upon conditions at the time the final plat or site plan application is submitted. Adequacy of the transportation network serving the proposed development shall include adequate capacity and safe and efficient traffic circulation, consistency with the adopted Broward County and Town comprehensive plan transportation elements, the Broward County Trafficways Plan, and applicable traffic engineering standards adopted by the agencies with jurisdiction. Site-specific traffic studies may be required to be made and paid for by the applicant when the Town determines such a study is needed in order to evaluate the impacts of the proposed development on proposed or existing roadways as provided for in subsection (1)d. Roadway improvements needed to upgrade the regional transportation network shall be made in accordance with the Town, County, and Florida Department of Transportation traffic engineering standards and plans as applicable. Street improvements needed to upgrade local streets shall be made in accordance with the Town's engineering standards and acceptable applicable traffic engineering standards. Adequacy of the transportation network shall be in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  Level of service (LOS). For the purpose of issuing development permits, the level of service standards for roadways in the regional transportation network in the Town are those adopted by the Town and Broward County for the Concurrency District within which the proposed development is located. Property north of Ocean Bay Club Drive is located within the Northeast District of the Broward Transportation Concurrency area. Property south of Ocean Bay Club Drive is located within the Central District of the Broward Transportation Concurrency area. 
For the purpose of issuing development permits, the level of service standard for local streets (non-trafficway collector roadways) is peak season/peak hour LOS "C." 
b.  Measurement of capacities. The procedure for the initial measurement of highway capacities is the Generalized Two-Way Peak Hour Volumes for Florida's Urbanized Areas Table in FDOT's most current Quality/Level of Service Handbook. Alternately, highway capacity may also be determined through a detailed traffic engineering study of local conditions of traffic flow, field conditions and traffic operations. Such studies shall be technically developed and comply with proper and recognized traffic engineering procedures. The highway capacity methodology used to determine capacities and level of service on the regional roadway network must be approved by Broward County. All studies shall be evaluated by the Town, and/or other parties as the Town designates, for acceptability. In instances where the Town finds that the study does not comply with proper and recognized traffic engineering procedures, the study results will not be accepted. 
c.  Adequacy determination for regional transportation network. 
1.  For plats, replats, and plat note amendments, a finding by the County Commission will be required prior to recordation that the District within which the plat is located satisfies the adopted concurrency standards. Prior to application for a building permit, the applicant shall obtain a Transportation Concurrency Satisfaction Certificate from the Broward County Planning and Redevelopment Division. 
2.  A permit application involving development of previously improved lands shall be subject to an adequacy determination for the additional trips to be generated by the proposed development and the trips generated by any existing development. Existing development shall be construed to include previous development demolished no earlier than 18 months previous to the date the final plat is submitted, or the application for a site plan or building permit approval is submitted. 
3.  For a building permit application on property within a recorded plat that was approved by the County Commission on or after March 20, 1979, an adequacy determination shall include a determination that the development proposed in the application is consistent with the level of development approved by the County for the plat, as subsequently amended, that the County's finding of adequacy for the plat has not expired and the plat is not in violation of any transportation concurrency agreement. 
d.  Traffic impact studies. All development applications, except for development applications where the traffic generation of new (net) trips is less than 750 trips per day, shall submit a study identifying the traffic impact of the proposed development. The Town may also require traffic impact studies from development applications with less than 750 new trips per day in instances where existing traffic conditions warrant specific study. 
The traffic impact study shall identify existing traffic volumes and existing level of service for average daily, peak hour and peak season daily conditions. The study area shall include the entire Town. The study shall identify the project's daily and peak hour trip generation, trip distribution and traffic assignment. An analysis of peak hour turning movements at project entrances shall be provided. Traffic conditions at project build-out shall be identified including existing traffic, background traffic and project traffic. The impact of the project traffic on the operating condition of SR A1A and Commercial Boulevard shall be identified. The impact of the project on the level of service of other Town collectors shall also be assessed. An evaluation of the need for traffic improvements at project entrances and at other roadway locations shall be provided. 
e.  Required determination. 
1.  Before a development permit is approved which increases the density or intensity or changes the use of the property, the following findings shall be made: 
i.  The proposed development will not lower the level of service of arterials and collectors below the adopted levels. 
ii.  In instances where the proposed development will lower the level of service of Town arterials and collectors below the adopted LOS, or the existing level of service of Town arterials and collectors are below the adopted LOS then the developer must show that the necessary improvements to provide the LOS are: 
aa.  Under construction at the time a permit is issued, or 
bb.  The subject of an executed contract with a road contractor for immediate construction, or 
cc.  Provided in an enforceable development agreement and will be available prior to certificates of occupancy, or 
dd.  Included in the Town, Broward County or Florida Department of Transportation annual work program or capital improvement program or 
ee.  In compliance with the transportation proportionate fair share requirements of F.S.  163.3180, a determination of an applicant's fulfillment of transportation concurrency requirements for the roadway network has been made, and any necessary transit concurrency assessments imposed in accordance with the methodology provided for transportation concurrency management areas in section 5-182(a)(5)a) of the Broward County Code as amended from time to time, or 
ff.  There is an approved action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the development. 
iii.  The development is found to have vested rights. 
2.  Dedication of right-of-way. Right-of-way adjacent to the subject site needed to comply with the Broward County Trafficways Plan and the transportation element of the Town's Comprehensive Plan shall be conveyed to the public by dedication on the face of the plat, by deed, or, if acceptable to the Town and agency with jurisdiction, by grant of easement. 
(2)  Adequacy of water management. 
a.  The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas and easements for the construction and maintenance of a water management system to serve the proposed development and adjacent public rights-of-way in a manner which conforms to sound engineering standards and principles, and which will be provided in accordance with applicable provisions of the Town's Code of Ordinances and the local agency having water management review and permitting authority over the area. 
b.  The development order shall require that the applicant for a building permit demonstrate prior to the issuance of the building permit within the development that the following levels of service standards, where applicable, will be met prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy: 
1.  Buildings. The lowest floor elevation for buildings shall be no lower than the elevation for the respective area depicted on the "100-Year Flood Criteria Map." 
2.  Off-site discharge. Off-site discharge is not to exceed the inflow limit of South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) primary receiving canal or the local conveyance system. 
3.  Storm sewers. The design frequency applicable to storm sewers is the three-year rainfall intensity of the State Department of Transportation Zone 10 rainfall curves. 
4.  Floodplain routing. Calculated flood elevations based on the ten-year and 100-year return frequency rainfall of three-day duration shall not exceed the corresponding elevations of the ten-year "Flood Criteria Map" and the "100-Year Flood Elevation Map." 
5.  Antecedent water level. The antecedent water level is the higher elevation of either the control elevation or the elevation depicted on the map "Average Wet Season Water Levels." 
6.  On-site storage. Minimum capacity above antecedent water level and below floodplain routing elevations shall be design rainfall volume minus off-site discharge occurring during design rainfall. 
7.  Best management practices (BMP). Prior to discharge of surface or ground water, BMPs will be used to reduce pollutant discharge. 
(3)  Adequacy of potable water service. 
a.  Potable water service must be available prior to a certificate of occupancy to provide for the needs of the proposed development at the level of service for the Ft. Lauderdale Water Service Area or the Pompano Beach Water Service Area as applicable. The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas and easements which may be necessary for the installation and maintenance of a potable water distribution system which will meet all applicable building, health, and environmental regulations, including Chapter 17-22, Florida Administrative Code. 
b.  A finding that potable water service is available at the adopted level of service must be based upon a demonstration that an existing water treatment facility has sufficient plant and network capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the application and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved. If potable water service is not available, but will be made available, any development order shall be conditioned on such availability. A finding that potable water service will be made available at the adopted level of service must be based upon a demonstration that there is a fiscally feasible plan to construct or expand a water treatment facility which will have sufficient plant and network capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the development proposed by the application prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy for that development, and for other developments in the service area, which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved. 
c.  If a treatment plan is necessary, an agreement will be required between the Town and the developer prior to the issuance of a building permit to provide for the expansion of water treatment facilities necessary to service the proposed development. 
d.  Town or County Commission approval of an application for plat approval shall not be construed to effect a reservation of potable water plant or network capacity, or a commitment to provide service. 
(4)  Adequacy of wastewater treatment and disposal services. 
a.  Wastewater treatment and disposal services must be available prior to occupancy to provide for the needs of the proposed development at the adopted level of service. The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas and easements which may be necessary for the installation and maintenance of a wastewater disposal system which will meet all applicable health and environmental regulations. 
b.  A finding that wastewater treatment and disposal services are available at the adopted level of service must be based upon a demonstration that an existing wastewater treatment and disposal facility has sufficient plant and network capacity to provide for the wastewater treatment and disposal needs of the development proposed by the application and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which wastewater treatment or disposal capacity has been reserved. If existing capacity is unavailable, conditional approval may be granted if it is shown that there is a fiscally feasible plan to construct or expand a wastewater treatment and disposal facility which will have sufficient plant and network capacity to provide for the treatment and disposal needs of the development proposed by the application prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy for that development, and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which wastewater treatment or disposal capacity has been reserved. 
c.  An agreement will be required between the Town and the developer prior to the issuance of a building permit for the expansion of water/wastewater treatment and disposal facilities necessary to service the proposed development. 
d.  Town or County Commission approval of an application for plat approval shall not be construed to effect a reservation of wastewater capacity or commitment to provide service. 
(5)  Adequacy of solid waste disposal sites or facilities. 
a.  Solid waste disposal sites or facilities shall be available prior to occupancy to provide for the needs of the proposed development at the level of service. 
b.  A finding that solid waste disposal sites or facilities are available must be based upon a demonstration that existing solid waste disposal sites or facilities have sufficient capacity to provide for the solid waste disposal needs of the development proposed by the application and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which solid waste disposal capacity has been reserved. If existing capacity is unavailable, conditional approval may be granted if it is shown that there is an economically and fiscally feasible plan to expand solid waste disposal site so that sufficient capacity will be available for the solid waste disposal of the development proposed by the application and for other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which solid waste disposal capacity has been reserved. 
(6)  Adequacy of school facilities. Pursuant to the Amended Interlocal Agreement for Public School Facility Planning (ILA), the applicant, in collaboration with the Town, Broward County and the School Board of Broward County, shall ensure that public school facilities will be available for current and future students consistent with available financial resources and adopted level of service standards and that such facilities are available concurrent with the impact of proposed residential development. No residential plat, site plan or functional equivalent shall be approved by the Town until the School Board has reported that the school concurrency requirement has been satisfied consistent with the provisions and procedures in the ILA and the Town's ULDR. 
(7)  Adequacy of solid waste collection service. Solid waste collection service will be available prior to occupancy to provide for the needs of the proposed development. 
(8)  Adequacy of fire protection service. 
a.  Fire protection service will be adequate to protect people and property in the proposed development. 
b.  A finding that adequate fire protection service is available shall be based upon a determination that all water supply facilities either existing or proposed to be constructed by the developer shall be adequate to meet the fire protection needs of the proposed development. 
(9)  Adequacy of police protection service. Police protection service will be adequate to protect people and property in the proposed development. 
(10)  Adequacy of local parks and recreation facilities. Land suitable for residential development pursuant to the applicable land development regulations shall be designed to provide for the park, open space and recreational needs of the future residents of the developed area. 
(d)  Review for compliance with environmental standards and regulations. 
(1)  An application for a development permit shall be reviewed pursuant to applicable Federal, State, regional and local environmental regulations, including any applicable Broward County environmental standards and requirements, and any other environmental standards as may be applicable and necessary to determine that the proposed development has adequately addressed: 
a.  Hazardous material treatment and disposal services; 
b.  Impact on air quality, smoke, emissions of particulate matter; 
c.  Impact on wellfield protection; and 
d.  Impact on environmentally sensitive lands. 
(2)  Violation of environmental regulations. An application for a development permit may be denied or approved with appropriate conditions where the property is subject to a notice of violation of an environmental regulation by a County, State or Federal agency, which violation the Town Commission determines makes all or part of the land unsuitable for development. 
(e)  Consideration of lands containing historic or archaeologically significant artifacts or relics. 
(1)  If the proposed development application includes any property(ies) identified as having historic or archaeological significance in the Town's Comprehensive Plan or the Broward County Land Use Plan Map Series or is listed in the Florida Master Site File, then the applicant shall be responsible for requesting this information from the jurisdiction of historic or archaeological matters and submitting this information to the Town at the time of, and together with, a development application approval. 
(2)  If the site is designated under article VI of this chapter, then an approving development order shall include a finding that the development order is in compliance with article VI of this chapter. 
(f)  Protection of air navigation. If the plat or site plan includes property subject to notice requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, Subpart B, development within the plat or site plan must receive an FAA determination that it does not constitute a hazard to air navigation or require operational modifications to the airport to avoid such a hazard. The note on the plat or site plan shall specify this restriction. 
(g)  Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) review requirements. To the max extent feasible as determined by the Development Services Department, an application for development review shall consider the following Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles so as to minimize the risk to public safety and reduce the potential for criminal activity: 
(1)  Natural surveillance-Natural surveillance that promotes design features that maximize visibility of people, parking areas, building entrances, and vulnerable interior spaces thereby reducing crime opportunity by increasing offenders' risk of being observed. Such design features may include but not be limited to the placement of doors and windows that look out on to streets and parking areas, and designs that encourage pedestrians and on-lookers to use sidewalks, paths, and front yard areas. Natural surveillance is also facilitated by adequate sightlines and lighting. 
(2)  Territorial reinforcement-Physical design that helps to create or extend a sphere of influence, which increases offenders' sense of risk and legitimate users' sense of territorial control. Physical features that clearly define property lines and distinguish private spaces from public spaces may include, but not be limited to the use of such elements as landscape plantings, pavement designs, and gateway treatments. 
(3)  Natural access control-Physical strategies that decrease crime opportunity by denying or delaying access to crime targets and creating a perception of increased effort and risk in offenders. Streets, sidewalks, building entrances, and neighborhood gateways should be utilized to clearly indicate public routes and discourage access to private or off-limit areas with structural elements. Target hardening may also be achieved by the use of physical features that prohibit or delay entry or access, including, for example, window locks, door dead bolts and metal door frames, bollards, gates, and planters. 
(4)  The use of "dead space" for activities and maintenance of the built environment-as may be required by the Town in order to demonstrate compliance with CPTED principals.

(2)  Determination of available flexibility units. The Town Manager or designee shall maintain a log of the number of available flexibility units in each flexibility zone, the number of flexibility units assigned to parcels within each zone and within the Town, and the reason for assigning flexibility units to a parcel. 
(3)  Assignment of flexibility units. If a sufficient number of flexibility units are available, the Town may allocate flexibility units for mixed use development in the B-1 or B-1-A zoning district, as provided in sections 30-261 and 30-271, provided that the County's flexibility rules and regulations are met and all other applicable requirements of chapter 30 of the Code are met.

b.  Makes a final determination that the application, as presented, modified or conditioned complies with the applicable requirements or is vested with regard to any noncompliance and is therefore approved; and 
c.  Prescribes any appropriate modifications and/or conditions, to ensure compatibility or mitigate the impacts of the proposed application and to ensure safeguards in conformity with all applicable laws. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the approval is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.

gg.  A stacking space is hereby defined as a space within a vehicular use area for the temporary stopping of a vehicle awaiting service as provided in this section. A stacking space shall be 20 feet long by ten feet wide. A stacking space shall be located in an area within a parking facility which is not used for any other vehicular use such as access, parking, site circulation or loading. 
hh.  Inbound stacking requirements shall be counted from the first stopping point. Outbound stacking requirements shall be counted from the last stopping point. 
ii.  Each stacking space shall be clearly defined on the site plan and shall be in a location that does not conflict or interfere with other traffic entering, using, or leaving the site. The design configuration shall ensure that backing into the public street is prevented. 
jj.  Each proposed drive-through business shall be analyzed for consideration of vehicular circulation for other cars, pedestrian circulation, and ADA accessibility. 
kk.  Any business not listed shall have the same requirements as the most similar use described above, as determined by the DSD. 
3.  Circulation design. A parking lot abutting a trafficway shall be designed for full on-site circulation. A parking lot abutting a street other than a trafficway may be designed for partial on-site circulation. 
4.  Hotels and motels located on residentially zoned property shall be permitted to have back out parking into any public right-of-way except A1A if no traffic hazard is created. 
5.  Parking and loading areas to be curbed. Except for one-family and two-family dwellings, all parking and loading areas shall be constructed with a six-inch raised curb or bumper blocks located a minimum distance of seven feet behind the street right-of-way line and other property lines along sidewalks, safety islands, driveways, sight distance triangles, and other places as needed unless determined to be unnecessary by a finding of the Town that given the particular circumstances of the site such curb can be eliminated in certain areas without creating safety hazards. The raised curb shall be constructed in such a manner as to prevent vehicles from crossing sidewalks or other pedestrian walkways, other than by means of an approved driveway approach. 
(2)  Loading facilities. 
a.  Off-street truck loading and unloading areas may be required for all buildings and establishments which receive and/or ship materials or merchandise by truck. The number of loading spaces, design of spaces and any exceptions to the requirement will be determined by the DSD and approving body. The determination will be based on a review of the site and surrounding properties, the current building configuration (if a renovation or site plan amendment) and the ability to provide required loading and unloading areas without reducing required parking spaces. 
b.  Off-street truck loading shall be required except as provided in subsection c. below. If the off-street loading facilities are required, they shall be designed to accommodate both the parking and maneuvering of the design vehicle exclusive of those areas designated for aisles, driveways or parking stalls. 
c.  If off-street loading facilities are not required, then on-street loading vehicles shall be situated in such a way that the sidewalk and the street remains unobstructed and pedestrians and vehicles, respectively may pass. 
(3)  Vehicular reservoir areas. Adequate reservoir capacity shall be required for both inbound and outbound vehicles to facilitate the safe and efficient movement between the public right-of-way and the development. An inbound reservoir shall be of sufficient size to ensure that vehicles will not obstruct the adjacent roadway, the sidewalk and the circulation within the facility. An outbound reservoir shall be required to eliminate backup and delay of vehicles within the development. 
a.  Design. A reservoir area shall be designed to include a space of 12 feet wide by 20 feet long for each vehicle to be accommodated within the reservoir area and so that vehicles within the reservoir area do not block parking stalls, parking aisles or driveways of off-street parking facilities. 
b.  Adjacent to trafficway. The number of vehicles required to be accommodated within a reservoir area adjacent to a trafficway shall be established by the Town Engineer dependent on the proposed development and accepted industry standards. 
c.  Adjacent to nontrafficway street. All off-street parking facilities shall provide a reservoir area at the point(s) of connection of a driveway with a public right-of-way. The reservoir area for any residential use other than single-family detached or commercial use shall accommodate at least one percent of the number of parking stalls served by the driveway. For parking lots with fewer than 100 cars, the reservoir area shall be able to accommodate at least one car. 
d.  For a development adjacent to a nontrafficway street that generates less than 500 trips per day, a lesser number of stacking spaces may be authorized based on a traffic impact statement that indicates the characteristics of the proposed use or abutting right-of-way support a determination that the need for stacking spaces is less than required and the number of stacking spaces provided shall be sufficient to protect the safety of those traveling on and off site. 
(4)  Access for vehicles other than automobiles. 
a.  Structures intended for principal uses shall be made accessible to the following type of vehicles: 
1.  Residential uses, other than single-family or duplex: Single unit truck (SU). 
2.  Commercial uses: Single unit truck and semi-trailer (WB-40) combination intermediate. 
3.  Definitions of, as well as required specifications for, the above vehicle types shall be those found in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Geometric Highway Design. 
b.  All buildings other than single-family or duplex residences shall be accessible to fire apparatus from two sides. Fire engines shall be considered as a WB-40 as defined by the AASHTO Geometric Highway Design. The area required to meet the AASHTO design standards shall be paved or treated to ensure support to a 16-ton weight vehicle. This area shall be maintained free of trees and bushes and shall be clearly designated for this purpose. 
c.  Fire lanes shall be provided for all buildings or any part thereof which are set back more than 150 feet from the ultimate right-of-way line of a public road, or which exceed 30 feet in height and are set back more than 50 feet from the ultimate right-of-way line of a public road. Fire lanes shall be at least 20 feet in width with a minimum of ten feet provided between the fire lane and any adjacent building. Any dead-end road more than 300 feet long shall be provided with a turnaround area at the closed end. The turn-around area shall be a minimum of 90 feet in diameter. 
d.  Required parking spaces, parking aisles and driveways shall not be used as loading or parking areas for any type of vehicle, including emergency vehicles, other than automobiles. 
(5)  Driveway entrance from public right-of-way, excluding single-family, two-family and townhome dwellings. If a driveway connects development to a trafficway, or a street within a trafficway corridor, the provisions of subsection 30-122(b) shall apply. The following requirements apply to driveways connecting development to a nontrafficway corridor street. Single-family, two-family and townhome dwelling driveways are regulated in section 30-313 of the Town Code. 
a.  Design requirements. 
1.  The area within the development to which the driveway provides access shall be of sufficient size to allow all necessary functions for loading, unloading, and parking maneuvers to be carried out on private property and completely off the street right-of-way unless waived by the DSD. 
2.  The minimum distance from the ultimate right-of-way line at any ingress or egress driveway to any interior service drive or parking stall with direct access to such driveway shall be as noted in subsection (a)(9) of this section. 
b.  Number and location of driveway entrances. In order to provide the maximum safety with the least interference to the traffic flow on public streets, and to provide ease and convenience in ingress and egress to private property, the number and location of driveways shall be regulated relative to the intensity or size of the property served and the amount of frontage which that property has on a given street as follows: 
1.  One driveway shall be permitted for ingress and egress purposes to a single property or development. 
2.  Two driveways entering on a particular street from a single property or development may be permitted if all other requirements of this section are met and if the minimum driveway spacing between the two driveways equals or exceeds 50 feet. 
3.  Three driveways entering on a particular street from a single property or development may be permitted if all other requirements of this section are met and if the minimum driveway spacing between adjacent driveways equals or exceeds 100 feet. 
4.  In general, not more than three driveways will be permitted from a single property or development. However, in the case of extensive property development (property exceeding ten acres in total land area and/or containing more than 1,000 parking stalls), additional driveways may be permitted provided all other requirements of this section are met and the minimum driveway spacing between adjacent driveways equals or exceeds 300 feet. 
5.  The minimum driveway spacing between driveways on adjacent properties shall be 50 feet. This driveway spacing may be modified by the DSD and appropriate board or commission if a traffic engineering study acceptable to the Town demonstrates that public safety will not be adversely affected by such modification. 
c.  Driveway entrance width according to type. 
1.  Ramp-type or swale-type driveway entrance. Except as provided in subsection 2., below, all driveways shall be constructed with the standard ramp-type or swale-type driveway entrance and shall conform to the width requirements in the Town's design standards. 
2.  Street-type driveway entrance. Construction of a street-type driveway shall be required for entrances of any development which includes a parking area for 300 or more vehicles or where the development anticipates substantial loading or trucking operations. Such driveway shall be a minimum width of 30 feet and a maximum width of 60 feet. 
d.  Limitations on driveway entrance improvements. 
1.  There shall be a minimum of 15 feet of straight tangent length between a driveway and the radius return or chord of the ultimate right-of-way line of an intersection of local streets. At all other intersections the minimum straight tangent length shall be 50 feet. 
2.  There shall be a minimum of 45 feet between the closest radius return of a driveway and the intersection of local street ultimate right-of-way lines. At all other intersections the distance shall be 80 feet. 
3.  No driveway entrance shall include any public facility such as traffic signal poles, crosswalks, loading zones, utility facilities, fire alarm supports, meter boxes, sewer clean outs, or other similar type structures. 
4.  Within the ultimate right-of-way limits, the maximum recommended driveway grade is approximately three percent. The maximum allowable grade is 4.2 percent or one-half inch per foot. The maximum slope immediately beyond the ultimate right-of-way line shall not change in excess of five percent for either angle of approach or break over angle. Variations from these standards shall be permitted if adherence to these standards would cause incompatibility with existing swales. 
5.  Existing driveway approaches shall not be relocated, altered, or reconstructed without approval for relocation, alteration, or reconstruction of such driveway approaches. When the use of any driveway approach is changed, making any portion or all of the driveway approach unnecessary, the developer of the abutting property shall obtain a permit to abandon the driveway approach and shall, at the developer's expense, replace all necessary curbs, gutters, swale areas and sidewalks. 
6.  If the closest intersection involves two streets classified as arterial or collector, then traffic movements to and from any driveway within 125 feet of an intersection with a collector and 250 feet of an intersection with an arterial shall be limited to right turns only unless waived by the DSD and appropriate board or commission. 
7.  No driveway shall be constructed prior to issuance of a permit for work in the right-of-way by the appropriate governmental agency. 
(6)  Limitations on improvements in the ultimate right-of-way. No obstructions of any type which are deemed unsafe by FDOT or the Town shall be left in the ultimate right-of-way as a result of any improvements in the ultimate right-of-way. 
(7)  Sight distance. 
a.  Cross-visibility requirements at the intersection of driveways and public rights-of-way. If a driveway intersects a public right-of-way, there shall be no sight obstruction within a triangular area of property on both sides of a driveway formed by the intersection of each side of the driveway and the ultimate right-of-way line with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two other sides. 
b.  Cross-visibility requirements at pedestrian crosswalks and other areas of pedestrian concentration. If a crosswalk intersects a vehicular access aisle, driveway or an ultimate right-of-way, there shall be no sight obstruction within a triangular area of property on both sides of a crosswalk or walkway formed by the intersection of each side of the walkway and the ultimate right-of-way line or aisle with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two sides. 
c.  Sight triangles. 
1.  Within the triangular areas described above, it shall not be permissible to install, set out or maintain, or to allow the installation, setting out or maintenance of, either temporarily or permanently, any vehicular parking space, sign, wall, hedge, shrubbery, tree, earth mound, natural growth or other obstruction of any kind which obstructs cross-visibility at a level between 30 inches and eight feet above the level of the center of the adjacent intersection. Any wall or fence within the sight triangle must be constructed in such a manner as to provide adequate cross-visibility over or through the structure between 30 inches and eight feet in height above the driving surface. 
2.  The following will be permitted within the triangular area described above: 
i.  Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the area between 30 inches and eight feet above the level of the center of the adjacent intersection. Trees must be so located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping except required grass or ground cover shall not be located closer than five feet from the edge of any roadway pavement, and three feet from the edge of any alley or driveway pavement. 
ii.  Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers and traffic control devices. 
(8)  Design of trafficway corridors. A site connected to a street at any point within a trafficway corridor shall meet the design criteria, requirements and standards of the Broward County Land Development Code. 
(9)  Design of nontrafficway corridors. A site connected to a street which is not within a trafficway corridor shall meet the design criteria, requirements and standards of subsection 30-122(b). 
(10)  Required pervious area and green space. 
a.  Commercial and mixed use developments in the B-1 or B-1-A zoning district which front Commercial Boulevard: 0 percent. 
b.  All other commercial and mixed use developments in the B-1 or B-1-A zoning district: 15 percent. 
c.  Residential uses: 25 percent. 
d.  For the purposes of this requirement all other use, such as, but not limited to, utilities, transportation and office park, shall be included in the commercial category. In mixed use developments, the most restrictive of the applicable impervious area limitations shall be utilized. 
e.  If a property fronts the beach and the property owner has riparian rights on the beach, the portion of the property that has beach area cannot be counted towards the required landscaped pervious area. 
f.  The requirements of this subsection do not exempt any property from compliance with article VII, Landscape Code Requirements. 
g.  Pervious areas may be used to satisfy requirements for landscaping and setbacks, buffer strips, drain fields, passive recreation areas, or any other purpose that does not require covering with a material that prevents infiltration of water into the ground. 
h.  In the case of the use of an impervious material which does not cover all the surface to which it is applied, credit towards the computation of the pervious area shall be given according to the percentage of pervious area that is retained. However, pervious brick material may not be counted towards the required landscaped pervious area. 
i.  In cases where the ULDR allows some required parking stalls to be grassed, no credit towards the computation of pervious area shall be granted for such areas. 
j.  Each proposed development shall include provisions for the application of best management practices to enhance retention areas such as grass ponds, grass swales, French drains, or combinations thereof, and shall meet all requirements of the applicable 208 Areawide Wastewater Treatment Management Plan. 
(11)  Natural Resource Areas. If a proposed development includes all or any part of any lands identified as a Natural Resource Area by Broward County, or any lands for which a notice of public hearing for designation as a Natural Resource Area has been given, the proposed development shall incorporate the Natural Resource Area in such a fashion as to significantly conserve the integrity of the area as appropriate to the affected resource. The proposed development shall be subject to the following requirements: 
a.  A generalized resource survey (GRS) shall accompany a development application. Said GRS shall be conducted by a professional with appropriate expertise for the resource involved. The survey may be in the form of an aerial or field survey showing the approximate location and extent of the resource on the site, and shall be accompanied by photographs illustrating significant areas. The GRS shall be prepared at the same scale as the proposed site plan. Said survey shall contain a brief written assessment of the resources which have been identified. 
b.  Resource area modification. Negative development impacts upon natural resource areas are to be discouraged. However, upon demonstration by the applicant that one or more of the following conditions exist, a modification to the natural resource area may be proposed: 
1.  Street opening. The location of the natural resource area on the property prevents the opening of reasonable and necessary travel lanes in a public ROW; 
2.  Utilities and drainage. The location of the natural resource area on the property prevents the construction of utility lines or drainage facilities which cannot feasibly be rerouted; 
3.  Property access. The location of the natural resource area on the property prevents all reasonable access to the property; or 
4.  Property use. The location of the natural resource area on the property precludes all reasonable use of the property. 
c.  Resource management plan. Any proposed development activity which would negatively impact the natural resource area must be mitigated through a long term resource management plan, approvable by the Broward County Planning and Development Management Division, which significantly improves the viability of the remainder of the resource. Said resource management plan must be based upon the generalized resource survey and provide for the enhancement and/or the restoration of the ecological value of the remainder of the natural resource area through the proposed mitigation. 
d.  No development order shall be issued until an agreement providing for implementation of the resource management plan has been executed and recorded, and any covenants, easements or physical improvements required by the plan are in place; or 
e.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for developments that include natural resource areas unless it is determined that the applicable provisions of the resource management plan and agreement specified in subsection d., above, have been met. 
(12)  Sidewalks. Except as required in articles X and XI, all sidewalks shall be provided as follows: 
a.  Location. Sidewalks shall be constructed adjacent to all trafficways delineated on the Broward County Trafficways Plan, as amended, all functionally classified County collector roads and local streets.

Sec. 30-125. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - CONDITIONAL USE PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 30-126. - Conditional uses review. 
(a)  Defined. A conditional use is a use that would not be appropriate without restriction throughout the land use district, but which, if controlled as to number, area, location, hours of operation, and relation to the neighborhood or impacted vicinity, would promote the public health, safety, welfare, order, comfort, convenience, appearance, or prosperity of the neighborhood. 
(b)  Intent, purpose and effect. The purpose of this section is to ensure that a conditional use shall only be permitted on specific sites as provided in a particular zoning district or as provided in this Code. where the proposed use may be adequately accommodated without generating adverse impacts on properties and land uses within the immediate vicinity. 
    This section sets forth the procedures and criteria for approval of conditional uses on specific sites. A conditional use is quasi-judicial, and shall be permitted only upon a finding that the proposed use satisfies the specific review criteria of this section and other requirements of this Code. 
    An approval of a conditional use does not eliminate the need for other approvals, which may be required under this Code, including but not limited to site plan review. 
(c)  Application. A conditional use application shall provide the following information unless waived by the DSD: 
(1)  Traffic impact study meeting the requirements of section 30-71(c)(14)d; 
(2)  Square feet designated (indoors or out) for each specific use; 
(3)  Estimated employment; 
(4)  Estimated number and type of service vehicles; 
(5)  Any unique facilities or structures proposed as part of site improvements; and 
(6)  A description of any mitigative techniques to abate any possible adverse impacts of the proposed use on properties in the immediate vicinity including smoke, odor, noise, and other impacts. 
(d)  Specific criteria for approving a conditional use. A conditional use shall be permitted upon a finding by the Town Commission that the proposed use, as proposed or with additional conditions or modifications, satisfies the criteria herein specified. A conditional use shall be denied if the Town Commission determines that the proposed use does not meet the criteria herein provided or is adverse to the public interest. The Board and/or Commission may impose conditions and safeguards, in addition to those prescribed in the Code, as they determine are necessary for the protection of the surrounding area and to preserve the spirit and intent of the Town Code and Comprehensive Plan. The applicant shall demonstrate the following: 
(1)  Land use compatibility. The conditional use, including its proposed scale and intensity, traffic generating characteristics, and off-site impacts shall be compatible and harmonious with adjacent land uses and shall not adversely impact land use activities and residential areas in the immediate vicinity. 
For purposes of a conditional use review, compatibility is defined as a condition in which land uses or conditions can coexist in relative proximity to each other in a stable fashion over time such that no use or condition is unduly negatively impacted directly or indirectly by another use or condition. Compatibility of land uses is dependent on numerous development characteristics, which may impact adjacent or surrounding uses. They include: type of use, density, intensity, height, general appearance and aesthetics, odors, noise, smoke, vibration, traffic generation and nuisances. The Town Manager shall recommend whether the conditional use is compatible. Compatibility shall be measured based on all of the following characteristics of the proposed use or development in relationship to surrounding development in the immediate area: 
i.  Permitted uses, structures and activities allowed within the land use category; 
ii.  Building location, dimensions, height, and floor area ratio; 
iii.  Location and extent of parking, access drives and service areas; 
iv.  Traffic generation, hours of operation, noise levels and outdoor lighting; 
v.  Alteration of light and air; 
vi.  Setbacks and buffers such as fences, walls, landscaping and open space treatment; 
vii.  The architectural and site design are compatible with the character of the surrounding area; and 
viii.  Any existing or proposed signs or lighting will not adversely affect surrounding areas or vehicular traffic. 
(2)  Sufficient site size, site specifications, and infrastructure to accommodate the proposed use. The size and shape of the site, the proposed access and internal circulation, and the urban design must be adequate to accommodate the proposed scale and intensity of the conditional use requested. The site shall be of sufficient size to provide adequate screening, buffers, landscaping, open space, off-street parking, efficient internal traffic circulation, infrastructure and similar site plan improvements needed to mitigate against potential adverse impacts of the proposed use. 
(3)  Compliance with the Comprehensive Plan and Code of Ordinances. The conditional use shall comply with environmental, zoning, concurrency and other applicable regulations of this Code of Ordinances and shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
(4)  Proper use of mitigative techniques. The conditional use and site plan shall incorporate mitigative techniques needed to prevent adverse impacts to adjacent land uses. In addition, the design scheme shall appropriately address off-site impacts to ensure that land use activities in the immediate vicinity, including community infrastructure, are not burdened with adverse impacts detrimental to the general public health, safety and welfare. 
(e)  Conditional use approval amendments. A conditional use approval is specific to the density and intensity of the proposed use, the particular site plan and any supplemental conditions approved. Unauthorized modification to a site plan or any of the specifics or conditions of the conditional use approval is a violation of the Town Code and subject to code enforcement action and/or revocation of the conditional use approved. Any proposed modification to the conditional use that affects density, intensity or minimum code requirements of the site development plan will require review and approval by the Town Commission. 
(1)  The Town Manager shall determine if the request is a Level 1 Amendment or a Level 2 Amendment. In deciding whether an application is a Level 1 or Level 2 Amendment, the Town Manager shall consider the requirements of section 30-123(a)-(c) of the Code. 
a.  Level 1 Amendment: Shall be processed pursuant to the requirements for a Level 1 Review- Administrative Approval as set forth in section 30-113. 
b.  Level 2 Amendment: Shall be processed pursuant to the requirements for a Level 2 Review - Town Commission Approval as set forth in section 30-113. 
(f)  Continuing jurisdiction. The Town Commission hereby reserves to itself the jurisdiction and authority to review and revoke conditional use permits where the use or the continuation of the use: 
(1)  Violates the conditions set forth by the Town Commission as a requirement for the granting of the use; 
(2)  Is injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the community or of the public; 
(3)  Tends to attract vagrants, loiterers or habitually intoxicated persons; or 
(4)  Has a history of repeated Code violations.

(3)  Decisions of the Board of Adjustment are advisory to the Town Commission. 
(4)  A recommendation for approval by the Board of Adjustment confers no legal right to the applicant in the absence of subsequent approval by the Town Commission. 
(d)  Action by Town Commission. 
(1)  The Town Commission shall make express findings on the elements necessary for the granting of a variance as provided in subsection (e) below. 
(2)  The decision of the Town Commission is not final until the filing of a development order with the Town Clerk which shall be recorded in the official records of Broward County. 
(e)  Criteria for considering an "Application for a Variance." In considering an application for a variance, an application shall be evaluated by considering the following criteria: 
(1)  Special conditions and circumstances exist affecting the land, structure or building involved preventing the reasonable use of such land, structure or building. 
(2)  The circumstances which cause the hardship are peculiar to the property or to such a small number of properties that they clearly constitute a marked exception to other properties in the district. 
(3)  The literal interpretation of the provisions of the applicable regulation would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience. 
(4)  The hardship is not self-created or the result of mere disregard for, or ignorance of the provisions of the regulations. 
(5)  The variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the property and that the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the applicable zoning regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(6)  The grant of the variance does not permit a use not generally permitted in the district involved or a use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of the regulations of the district in which the affected property lies. 
(7)  Financial hardship is not a basis for granting a variance unless the failure to grant the variance will render the property unusable as a permitted use in the zoning district in which the property lies. 
(f)  Duration. 
(1)  Such rights and privileges shall be terminated at such time as designated in the conditions of the approval of the variance, or upon any interruption or cessation of the use permitted by the variance for one year or more. 
(2)  The Town shall have continuing jurisdiction over all variances and may revoke, modify or suspend the approval of the variance, after a public hearing before the Town Commission and notice given in the same manner as required for approval of a variance under article IV, division 9 of this chapter, under the following conditions: 
a.  The variance was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation: 
b.  The variance has been exercised contrary to the conditions of its approval; or 
c.  The exception permitted by the variance has been exercised so as to be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, so as to constitute a nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 2014-08,  3, 7-7-2014) 
Sec. 30-128. - Administrative adjustments. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish standards for review of applications for Administrative Adjustments. As defined in the Administrative Adjustment Thresholds Table below, Level 1 Administrative Adjustments may be approved by the Town Manager, and Level 2 Administrative Adjustments require Town Commission approval. 
    Administrative Adjustments are available for certain limited variations or adjustments to building or parking standards of the Code based on specific criteria, where the application of the standard creates practical difficulties in allowing development or redevelopment that otherwise advances the purposes served by the standards of this Code and the comprehensive plan, and is compatible with surrounding development. 
    Administrative Adjustments can also support flexibility in development and redevelopment efforts encouraging design and compatibility equal to or better than that resulting from the strict application of the Code, in furtherance of the Architectural Design Standards of the Town and the desired Mid-Century Modern architectural style. 
(b)  Eligibility. Developments located within any zoning district are eligible to apply for an Administrative Adjustment except that adjustments to the parking standards are not permitted in the B-1 or B-1-A zoning districts. The thresholds applicable to Level 1 and Level 2 Administrative Adjustments are shown in the following table, Administrative Adjustment Thresholds. 
Administrative Adjustment Thresholds Building Standards 
that May be Adjusted Maximum Level 1

Any person claiming vested rights to develop property shall make application for a vested rights determination which shall be processed in accordance with section 30-113 of this article. 
(1)  The Town Manager shall review the application and any supporting documents and shall consult with other staff and the Attorney's Office following which the Town Manager shall either grant the application for vested rights or respond to the applicant in writing providing the reason or reasons for denial.

(b)  Existing agreements giving rise to vested rights: 
(1)  The Town of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea recognizes that certain property owners or developers may have a claim to a vested right based upon agreements with the Town entered into prior to March 14, 1989, the adoption date of the 1989 Lauderdale-By-The-Sea Comprehensive Plan. The Town recognizes that such rights would arise in a circumstance where: 
a.  All regional roads. 
1.  The agreement provided for the developer to undertake or fund a road improvement which exceeded the developer's obligation under any plat approval; and 
2.  The agreement contains language or evidences of the intent that construction of the road improvement would satisfy the developer's obligation to ensure the adequacy of the regional road network with regard to specified development on a described parcel which was not undergoing platting; and 
3.  The developer acted in reliance upon the agreement and is not in default of the provisions of the agreement. 
b.  Specific road segment. 
1.  The agreement provided for the developer to undertake a road improvement which is unrelated to plat approval; and 
2.  The developer did not receive payment or credit for such improvement since it was determined that the road would be required to provide safe and adequate access to the unplatted property; and 
3.  The developer constructed the road to service his development without any compensation; and 
4.  In such circumstances the vested trips on the road segment constructed by the developer shall not exceed the lesser of the number of trips the road improvement can accommodate at level of service D or the number of trips generated on the segment by the intensity or density of development specified in the agreement. 
(2)  Entitlement to impact fee credits pursuant to an agreement shall not, of itself, constitute a basis for vesting a development or the trips represented by the impact fee credits. 
(3)  It is recognized that there may be additional circumstances where some vested rights have arisen which are not specified in subsections(1)a. or b. 
(4)  Procedure for claiming vested rights. 
a.  Any property owner or developer may seek a vested rights determination regarding a specific unplatted parcel for which additional intensity or density is sought. 
b.  Requests for vested rights determination shall be made on forms provided by the DSD. The developer shall be required to state the parcel for which the vested rights determination is sought, the basis for the vested rights claim, and shall provide a copy of the agreement or other document which the developer asserts gives rise to a vested rights determination. 
c.  After the developer has submitted a complete application for a vested rights determination to the DSD it shall be forwarded to the Town's Attorney for review. 
d.  A Hearing Officer shall be appointed to conduct an administrative hearing regarding the vested rights determination. The hearing shall be set for no later than 60 days from the date of application unless an extension of time is requested or agreed to by the applicant. 
e.  The Town Attorney shall represent the Town in the administrative hearing. The Hearing Officer shall determine whether vested rights have been created pursuant to statute or established case law. 
f.  If the Town's Attorney, any time before the hearing, reviews the application and finds that the application has provided clear evidence that vested rights claimed by the developer exist, the Town Attorney and the applicant may stipulate to the existence of vested rights. Such stipulation shall eliminate the need for a determination by the Hearing Officer. 
g.  If vested rights are stipulated to or found by the Hearing Officer, the trips attributable to such vested rights shall be placed within the Broward County TRIPS system and shall be available to the benefitted property for a period of five years. 
h.  A determination by the Hearing Officer that vested rights have not arisen shall be determined to be a final decision of the Town.

(c)  Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  Continuance and replacement of nonconforming structures. The lawful existence of a structure or building at the effective date of adoption of these regulations, although such structure or building does not conform to the land development regulations for minimum lot area and dimension, minimum yard setback requirements, maximum building height, total floor area, lot coverage, square footage, density, parking and minimum floor area requirements or other characteristics of the structure, or its location on the lot, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a new nonconforming building from being constructed either with less total square footage or with less habitable square footage than that of the original nonconforming building which it replaces. For the purposes of this section, the term "habitable square footage" means the square footage of that portion of a building that is used as a home or place of abode, either permanent or temporary, by one or more persons.

The parking spaces shall be allocated on a first come, first serve basis, as measured by the Town's receipt of a complete application package. 
(2)  Eligibility for program. The application, and all supporting documents, including any applicable building permit or development approval applications, for the construction of a new restaurant or for a restaurant expansion, shall have been submitted and deemed to be complete by the Town prior to the program deadlines, and all required permits received and the restaurant subsequently built within the time periods specified in the Town's Code. 
(3)  Program guidelines. 
a.  Districts. There are hereby created two separate and distinct Parking Exemption Districts as follows: 
1.  Oceanfront Center. The Oceanfront Center shall include all B-1 and B-1-A zoned land adjacent to State Road A1A or Commercial Boulevard, east of Seagrape and, for the purposes of determining underutilized spaces, shall include the El Prado and A1A parking lots. 
2.  Commercial Business District. The Commercial Business District shall include all B-1 and B-1-A zoned land adjacent to Commercial Boulevard, west of Seagrape. 
b.  Exemption maximum. 
1.  District maximums. The maximum number of spaces available for exemption in each parking district shall be established by resolution of the Town Commission. 
2.  Oceanfront Center. There shall be a maximum exemption of 30 parking spaces per eligible restaurant. 
3.  Commercial Business District. There shall be a maximum exemption of 50 parking spaces per eligible restaurant. 
c.  Eligible restaurant. An eligible restaurant shall be a commercial establishment where food and beverages are ordered and consumed on premises and serviced by its own kitchen. No restaurant kitchen may provide eligibility for parking exemption for more than one restaurant. 
d.  Program duration. The parking exemption program shall last in each district for a period of four years, from March 8, 2011, to March 7, 2015, or until the maximum number of parking exemptions is allocated, whichever is earlier. However, during the four-year period, but after the initial allocation of the maximum number of parking exemptions in a district, the parking exemption program may be reactivated in that district if additional parking spaces are added to the total number of spaces available within the district, either by action of the Town Commission or expiration or loss of parking exemptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Town Commission, may, for any reason and in its sole discretion, discontinue this parking exemption program at any point during the four years. 
e.  Effect on 1995 exemption of pre-existing buildings, structures and uses from the parking requirement. The parking exemption program provided herein is supplemental to, and in no way changes the parking exemption established in 1995 in section 30-314(b). Any parking space exemptions provided under the parking exemption program are in addition to any parking credits that may exist under the 1995 program. 
(4)  Status following end of program. 
a.  Nonconforming. At the end of the parking exemption program, all restaurants built under the parking exemption program will become nonconforming uses, and shall be subject to the requirements of the nonconforming use provisions of the Town's Code of Ordinances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, restaurants or expansions of restaurants built under the parking exemption program may be completely remodeled or rebuilt without providing additional parking, as originally permitted through the parking exemption program, as long as the square footage of customer service area is not increased. 
b.  Availability of exemptions to successor businesses. If an eligible restaurant has opened and is operating with any exemptions obtained pursuant to the parking exemption program those exemptions will remain with the property for the benefit of future uses, even after the restaurant receiving the exemption is gone. 
c.  Changes in square footage or use. The parking space exemptions obtained pursuant to the parking exemption program shall remain with the property. The use of the property may change and the square footage may increase or decrease without losing the parking exemption spaces. If a change of use or expansion creates the need for additional parking spaces under the Code standards in effect at the time of building permit, those additional spaces must be provided. 
(5)  Reports. 
a.  Notice prior to maximum utilization by district. The Town Manager shall advise the Town Commission when spaces are allocated under this program, indicating the number of spaces allocated and the number of spaces available in each district. 
b.  Bi-annual report. The Town Manager shall provide a bi-annual report to the Commission that describes the utilization, effectiveness and impacts of the parking exemption program. 
(6)  Notice and hearing prior to expiration of program. Following public notice, the Town Commission shall conduct a public hearing and evaluation of the program's impacts at least six months prior to its expiration on March 7, 2015.

This program shall be referred to as the PILOP program. 
(a)  Applicability.

(2)  Non-refundable. All application fees and PILOP fees paid are non-refundable. 
(3)  Late payments. 
a.  For late payments, daily interest shall accrue on unpaid funds due to the Town under the PILOP program at the maximum statutory interest rate. 
b.  Additionally, a charge in the amount of two percent of the total due, not to exceed $500.00 a week or portion thereof, shall be imposed for each day that the payment is late to cover the Town's costs in administering collection procedures.

a.  Any property owner in the PILOP program who has failed to either apply for a suspension of payment as described in subsection (6) below or pay the required payment within 120 days of the date on which it is due shall be regarded as having withdrawn from the program and shall be required to either:

c.  For purposes of this subsection, the "net required parking spaces" shall be calculated as illustrated: If the property owner agreed to a PILOP fee for ten parking spaces, and defaulted after paying 75 percent of the total PILOP fee, the property owner would be credited with seven parking spaces and required to provide three parking spaces or reduce their customer service area by the corresponding amount. Any fractional number of spaces for which the PILOP fee is not paid shall be rounded down to a whole number for purposes of this paragraph. 
(5)  Credit of payment. Payments shall be applied in the following order:

(6)  Exceptions. The location of a new antenna in any zoning district other than those districts specified in this section shall be prohibited unless approved as a special exception. 
(e)  Shared use of communication antennas. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of telecommunication towers, co-location of facilities on existing or new towers shall be encouraged by: 
a.  Only issuing permits to qualified shared facilities at locations where it appears there may be more demand for towers than the property can reasonably accommodate; or 
b.  Giving preference to qualified shared facilities over other facilities in authorizing use at particular locations. 
(2)  For a facility to become a "qualified shared facility", the facility owner must show that: 
a.  The facility is appropriately designed for sharing; and 
b.  The facility owner is prepared to offer adequate space on the facility to others on fair and reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms. 
(3)  To satisfy the requirements of subsection (2)a of this section, the facility owner must submit a written evaluation of the structural capacity of the tower. 
(4)  The requirements of subsection (2)b of this section will be deemed to have been met if the facility owner shows that it has executed a joint use agreement with at least one other unaffiliated entity for shared use, and agrees to offer a similar contract to others. In other cases, the facility owner must enter into an agreement with the Town, acceptable to the Town, to offer space on fair, reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms, at fair market value, and to negotiate leases promptly and without undue delay. A condition of any permit for a qualified shared facility shall be that the permit shall be terminated, and the facility removed, if the Town finds that the facility owner is not complying with its obligations under this section and associated agreements with the Town. 
(5)  Co-location of communication antennas by more than one provider on existing or new telecommunication towers shall take precedence over the construction of new single-use telecommunication towers. Accordingly, each application for a telecommunication tower shall include the following: 
a.  A written evaluation of the feasibility of sharing a telecommunication tower, if an appropriate telecommunication tower or towers is/are available. The evaluation shall analyze one or more of the following factors: 
1.  Structural capacity of the tower or towers; 
2.  Radio frequency interference; 
3.  Geographical service area requirements; 
4.  Mechanical or electrical incompatibility; 
5.  Inability or ability to locate equipment on the tower or towers; 
6.  Availability of towers for co-location; 
7.  Any restrictions or limitations of the Federal Communications Commission that would preclude the shared use of the tower. 
8.  Additional information requested by the Town. 
b.  The Town may deny an application if an available co-location is feasible and the application is not for such co-location. 
(6)  A telecommunication tower that is determined to be inappropriate for sharing shall be assumed to be inappropriate for sharing the same types of facilities in the future. Such towers will not need to be evaluated in the future regarding sharing with the same type of facility for which it has been determined to be inappropriate. The Community Services Department shall retain a list of such towers, and will provide a copy of the list to all potential applicants. The Town may require additional sharing feasibility evaluations if warranted by changes in technology. 
(7)  For any telecommunications tower approved for shared use, the owner of the tower shall provide notice of the location of the telecommunication tower and the tower's load capacity to all other providers. 
(f)  Applications. Unless otherwise authorized by State or Federal law, no person shall construct, install or maintain a telecommunications tower or antenna within the Town without the Town's approval pursuant to the requirements of this section. An applicant must submit an application form for a person to apply for the construction, installation, modification or placement of a telecommunications tower or antenna within the Town consistent with the terms of this section. All applications shall be accompanied by a non-refundable filing fee. 
(1)  The Town Manager shall review the application for installation, modification or placement of a telecommunications tower or antenna for consistency with this section. For applications that are not subject to the Town Commission's approval pursuant to this section, the Town Manager shall issue a written decision either granting or denying an application. The Town Manager shall not grant an application for a proposed telecommunications tower or antenna that is not in compliance with this section. In the event that the Town Manager denies an application, the Town Manager shall set forth the reasons for denial in writing. It is the intent of this subsection to establish a procedure for compliance with the "written decision" and "substantial evidence" requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C.  332(c)(7)(B)(iii). 
(2)  The Town Manager shall notify the applicant within 20 days after the date the application is submitted as to whether the application is, for administrative purposes only, properly completed and has been properly submitted in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. However, such determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. Such notification shall indicate with specificity any deficiencies which, if cured, would make the application properly completed. 
(3)  In the event that the Town Manager determines that an application for a proposed telecommunications tower or antenna subject to Town Commission approval is not in compliance with this section, the Town Manager shall recommend that the Town Commission deny the application and shall set forth the reasons for denial in writing. 
(4)  For an application for a telecommunications tower or antenna which is subject to its review, the Town Commission shall consider the application, the Town Manager's recommendation, and any additional evidence presented by the applicant, Town staff and the public. 
(5)  Any decision of the Town Commission to deny an application shall authorize the Town Manager to set forth in writing the Town Commission's reasons for the denial. 
(6)  The Town shall grant or deny each properly completed application for a co-location pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, based on the application's compliance with this section, and within the normal time frame for a similar building permit review, but in no case later than 45 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This time frame shall not apply to an application for collocation [co-location] on Town-owned property. 
(7)  The Town shall grant or deny each properly completed application for any other telecommunications tower or antenna based on the application's compliance with this section and any other applicable law, including but not limited to the Code of Ordinances and within the normal time frame for a similar type of review, but in no case later than 90 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This time frame shall not apply to an application for a telecommunications tower or antenna on Town-owned property. 
(8)  An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the Town. If the Town does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is not completed in compliance with the Town's regulations within 20 business days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, the application is deemed, for administrative purposes only, to be properly completed and properly submitted. However, the determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. If the application is not completed in compliance with the Town's regulations, the Town shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies in the required documents or deficiencies in the content of the required documents which, if cured, make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the Town shall notify the applicant, in writing, within no more than 20 business days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. However, if the applicant does not cure the application deficiencies within 20 business days after receiving the notice of deficiencies, the application shall be considered withdrawn. 
(9)  The time frames specified in this subsection may be extended because the Town's procedures which are generally applicable to the application for a telecommunications tower or antenna require action by the Town Commission, and such review has not taken place within the specified time frames. Under such circumstances, the Town Commission shall either grant or deny the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(10)  The Town may request, but not require, a waiver of the time frames by the applicant, except that, with respect to a specific application, the Town may require a one-time waiver in the case of a declared local, State, or Federal emergency that directly affects the administration of all permitting activities of the Town. 
(11)  Where action by the Town Commission or any other Town agency is required on an application for a permit pursuant to this subsection, the Town Manager may by letter to the applicant extend the time frame for a decision until the next available scheduled date of the Town Commission or agency as to whether to grant or deny an application for a permit taken pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicant may voluntarily agree to waive the time frames set forth above. 
(12)  If an application which is subject to administrative approval by the Town Manager is denied for noncompliance with the requirements of this section, the applicant may appeal this decision in accordance with section 30-531 of the Town Code. 
(13)  The replacement or modification of an existing telecommunications tower or antenna, as defined in subsection (b) of this section, shall require a building permit only and shall not require additional approval under this section, provided that the Town Manager determines that: 
a.  The replacement or modification will not cause the telecommunications tower or antenna to be readily discernible as different in size, type, and appearance when viewed from ground level from surrounding properties; or 
b.  The replacement or modification is of a telecommunications tower or antenna which is not visible from surrounding properties. 
(g)  The issuance of a permit, however, is not a lease and no municipally owned property may be used without a lease agreement with the Town. The Town may, as appropriate, to protect its property and the public interest, establish additional requirements beyond the minimum requirements of a permit for municipally owned property. This provision further does not preclude the Town from issuing a letter of interest for the purposes of leasing sites on designated Town property for the construction and installation of telecommunications towers and antennas. For designated neighborhood parks, the Town will encourage the installation of facilities which have a minimal impact on the surrounding areas and are consistent with the development of the park.

To change the designated rental agent, the owner shall notify the Town in writing of the name, contact information and certifications required in subsection (i)1. above for the new rental agent and pay the applicable fee, if any, determined by resolution of the Town Commission. Any notice of violation or legal process which has been delivered or served upon the previous rental agent, prior to the Town's receipt of notice of change of the rental agent, shall be deemed effective service. 
5.  It shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner to appoint a reliable rental agent and to inform the agent of his or her correct mailing address.

Sec. 30-500. - Purpose, scope and intent. 
(a)  Purpose. In accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court's cases on sign regulation, the regulations in this article are not intended to regulate or censor speech based on its content or viewpoint, but rather to regulate the secondary effects of speech that may adversely affect the Town's substantial and compelling governmental interests in preserving scenic beauty and community aesthetics, and in vehicular and pedestrian safety in conformance with the First Amendment. These cases and their holdings include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, U.S., 135 S. Ct. 2218, 192 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2015) on the topic of noncommercial temporary signs; 
(2)  Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) on the topic of commercial signs and off-premise signs; 
(3)  City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43 (1994) on the topic of political protest signs in residential areas; 
(4)  Linmark Assocs., Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85 (1977) on the topic of real estate signs in residential areas; 
(5)  Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191 (1992) on the topic of election signs near polling places; 
(6)  Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, 447 U.S. 557 (1980) on the topic of regulation of commercial speech; and 
(7)  City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) on the topic of signs on public property. 
(b)  Scope. 
(1)  The provisions of this article shall govern the number, size, location, and character of all signs which may be permitted under the terms of this article. No signs shall be permitted on a plot or parcel except in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(2)  This article does not regulate government signs on government property, including traffic control devices. 
(3)  In the event of any conflict between this article and any declaration of covenants, bylaws, or other restrictions applying to any property within the Town, the language affording the more restrictive interpretation shall apply. 
(4)  The Town specifically finds that these sign regulations are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling and substantial governmental interests of traffic safety and aesthetics, and that there is no other way for the Town to further these interests. 
(c)  Intent. 
(1)  Substitution clause. It is not the purpose of this article to regulate or control the copy, content or viewpoint of signs. Nor is it the intent of this article to afford greater protection to commercial speech than to noncommercial speech. Any sign, display or device allowed under this article may contain, in lieu of any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that complies with all other requirements of this article. The noncommercial message may occupy the entire sign area or any portion thereof, and may substitute for or be combined with the commercial message. The sign message may be changed from commercial to noncommercial, or from one noncommercial message to another, as frequently as desired by the sign's owner, provided that the sign is not prohibited and the sign continues to comply with all requirements of this article. 
(2)  This article establishes comprehensive regulations for the control of signs in order to preserve, protect, and promote the public health, safety and general welfare. More specifically, this article is intended to assist in achieving the following objectives: 
a.  To authorize the use of signs that: 
1.  Are compatible with their surroundings and the zoning district in which they are located and aid orientation and ensure pedestrian and traffic safety; 
2.  Project the image, character and style the Town desires to promote; 
3.  Reduce the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive area of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and are not necessary to aid in wayfinding; 
4.  Establish size, number and placement limitations to ensure signage is the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location, the nature of such uses and to allow smooth, safe navigation to these locations with signs that are legible in the circumstances in which they are seen; and 
5.  Are not distracting or cluttered in a manner that disturbs the safe and free flow of vehicular and pedestrian movement; 
6.  Are effective in performing the function of identifying and safely directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic to a destination; 
7.  Do not interfere with, obstruct the vision of, or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
b.  To enhance the economic vitality of existing businesses and foster quality redevelopment by promoting the reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs; 
c.  To encourage sound sign display practices, and to mitigate the objectionable effects of competition in respect to the size and placement of signs; 
d.  To enhance the physical appearance of the Town by protecting the manmade and natural beauty of the area; 
e.  To preserve the value of private property by assuring the compatibility of signs with nearby land uses; 
f.  Allow for traffic control devices and government signs without regulation consistent with national standards, because they promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and by notifying road users of regulations and providing nationally consistent warnings and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream and modes of travel, while regulating private signs to ensure that their size, location and other attributes do not impair the effectiveness of such traffic control devices; 
g.  To prohibit the display of private signs on government property or right-of-way; 
h.  Not regulate signs more than necessary to accomplish the compelling and substantial governmental objectives described herein; and 
i.  To enable fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations.

As a consideration for this franchise, the Grantee shall pay to the Grantor, commencing 90 days after the effective date hereof, and each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this franchise, an amount which added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees, charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem property taxes and non-ad valorem tax assessments on property) levied or imposed by the Grantor against the Grantee's property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during the Grantee's monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment will equal 5.9 percent of the Grantee's billed revenues, less actual write-offs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential, commercial and industrial customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff) within the incorporated areas of the Grantor for the monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall payment for the rights and privileges granted herein exceed 5.9 percent of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the Grantee. 
    The Grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the preceding paragraph are limited, as in the existing franchise Ordinance No. 249, to the precise revenues described therein, and that such revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a) revenues from the sale of electrical energy for Public Street and Highway Lighting (service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from Other Sales to Public Authorities (service with eligibility restricted to governmental entities); (c) revenues from Sales to Railroads and Railways (service supplied for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues from Sales for Resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e) franchise fees; (f) Late Payment Charges; (g) Field Collection Charges; (h) other service charges. 
    Section 6. If during the term of this franchise the Grantee enters into a franchise agreement with any other municipality located in Broward County, Florida, the population of which is equal to or less than that of the Grantor, the terms of which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the Grantee at a rate greater than 6.0 percent of the Grantee's residential, commercial and industrial revenues (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff), under the same terms and conditions as specified in Section 5 hereof, the Grantee, upon written request of the Grantor, shall negotiate and enter into a new franchise agreement with the Grantor in which the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments under Section 5 hereof shall be no greater than that percentage which the Grantee has agreed to use as a basis for the calculation of payments to the other Broward County municipality, provided, however, that such new franchise agreement shall include additional benefits to the Grantee, in addition to all benefits provided herein, at least equal to those provided by its franchise agreement with the other Broward County municipality. Subject to all limitations, terms and conditions specified in the preceding sentence, the Grantor shall have the sole discretion to determine the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments, and the Grantee shall have the sole discretion to determine those benefits to which it would be entitled, under any such new franchise agreement. 
    Section 7. As a further consideration, during the term of this franchise or any extension thereof, the Grantor agrees: (a) not to engage in the distribution and/or sale, in competition with the Grantee, of electric capacity and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility service (herein called a "retail customer") or to any electrical distribution system established solely to serve any retail customer formerly served by the Grantee, (b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the purpose or terms of which would be to obligate the Grantee to transmit and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third party(ies) to any other retail customer's facility(ies), and (c) not to seek to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute electric capacity and/or electric energy generated by or on behalf of the Grantor at one location to the Grantor's facility(ies) at any other location(s). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit the Grantor from engaging with other utilities or persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act. 
    Nothing herein shall prohibit the Grantor, if permitted by law, (i) from purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or (ii) from seeking to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute to any facility(ies) of the Grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the Grantor from any other person; provided, however, that before the Grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the Grantor's facilities to be served under the offer. The Grantee shall thereafter have 90 days to evaluate the offer and, if the Grantee offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, the Grantor shall be obligated to continue to purchase from the Grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the previously-identified facilities of the Grantor for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. If the Grantee does not agree to rates, terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer, all of the terms and conditions of this franchise shall remain in effect. 
    Section 8. If the Grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions which the Grantee determines are more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the Grantee may at any time thereafter terminate this franchise if such terms and conditions are not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 60 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of such terms and conditions that it considers more favorable. The Grantor shall then have 60 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the terms and conditions complained of by the Grantee. If the Grantee determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice. 
    Section 9. If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the incorporated areas of the Grantor to a customer then being served by the Grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve, and the Grantee determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this franchise in respect to rates and service, place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the Grantee may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this franchise if such competitive disadvantage is not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 90 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of the consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage. The Grantor shall then have 90 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive disadvantage. If such competitive disadvantage is not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall take effect on the date of delivery of such notice. 
    Section 10. Failure on the part of the Grantee to comply in any substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by the Grantee until there is final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the Grantee shall have six months after such final determination to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right of the Grantor at its discretion to grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as necessities in the case require. 
    Section 11. Failure on the part of the Grantor to comply in substantial respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to: (a) denying the Grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of this franchise; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the Grantee a use permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, shall constitute breach of this franchise and entitle the Grantee to withhold all or part of the payments provided for in Section 5 hereof until such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination in the matter. The Grantor recognizes and agrees that nothing in this franchise agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the Grantee's delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that the Grantee, in its sole discretion, may exercise such right. 
    Section 12. The Grantor may, upon reasonable notice and within 90 days after each anniversary date of this franchise, at the Grantor's expense, examine the records of the Grantee relating to the calculation of the franchise payment for the year preceding such anniversary date. Such examination shall be during normal business hours at the Grantee's office where such records are maintained. Records not prepared by the Grantee in the ordinary course of business may be provided at the Grantor's expense and as the Grantor and the Grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the Grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not be taken from the Grantee's premises. Such audit shall be impartial and all audit findings, whether they decrease or increase payment to the Grantor, shall be reported to the Grantee. The Grantor's right to examine the records of the Grantee in accordance with this Section shall not be conducted by any third party employed by the Grantor whose fee, in whole or part, for conducting such audit is contingent on findings of the audit. 
    Grantor waives, settles and bars all claims relating in any way to the amounts paid by the Grantee under the Current Franchise Agreement embodied in Ordinance No. 249. 
    Section 13. The provisions of this ordinance are interdependent upon one another, and if any of the provisions of this ordinance are found or adjudged to be invalid, illegal, void or of no effect, the entire ordinance shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 
    Section 14. As used herein "person" means an individual, a partnership, a corporation, a business trust, a joint stock company, a trust, an incorporated association, a joint venture, a governmental authority or any other entity of whatever nature. 
    Section 15. Ordinance No. 249, passed and adopted September 27, 1977 and all other ordinances and parts of ordinances and all resolutions and parts of resolutions in conflict herewith, are hereby repealed. 
    Section 16. As a condition precedent to the taking effect of this ordinance, the Grantee shall file its acceptance hereof with the Grantor's Clerk within 30 days of adoption of this ordinance. The effective date of this ordinance shall be the date upon which the Grantee files such acceptance.
