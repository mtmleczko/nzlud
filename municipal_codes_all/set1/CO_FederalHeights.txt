PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Federal Heights, Colorado. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented through December 31, 2003, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Beth L. Williams and Robert McNaughton, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Phyllis Schott, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Such schedule may be determined based upon the age of the dwelling units, size of the rental complex, complaints received from residents or the public, or the general condition of the property.

(2)  The inspector will document any violations of this article on a written inspection report and may make a photographic record of the property or of any violations discovered on the property. 
(3)  Upon receipt of notice of a scheduled or complaint-based inspection, the owner of the residential rental property may, at the owner's cost, employ a qualified independent inspector from a list provided by the city to perform the required inspection. 
    To be deemed compliant with this article, the property owner must, within 45 days of the scheduled inspection, submit to the city a written report from the qualified independent inspector that the residential rental property is in compliance with all standards and requirements set forth in this article. 
    For a complaint-based inspection the property owner must, within 21 days of the notice, cause such property to be inspected by the qualified independent inspector, who must also provide a written report of such inspection to the city. Should violations of this article be found to exist, the property owner must correct such within 90 days of submittal of the inspector's report, which correction(s) must also be certified as compliant with this article to the city by the qualified independent inspector. The property owner may be granted an extension of time by the city if the qualified independent inspector determines that substantial progress is being made to correct the violation.

Upon receipt the city shall in consideration of all applicable facts determine the terms and conditions of the extension.

If the owner, occupant, or a person having charge or control cannot be located after a reasonable effort, a notice of intent to inspect will be posted on the premises. The notice will state that the property owner has the right to refuse entry and that, in the event such entry is refused, inspection may be made upon issuance of an administrative warrant by a municipal judge of the city. 
(2)  If entry is refused, or 24 hours after the premises have been posted, the inspector may appear before the municipal judge and, upon a showing of probable cause, or upon a showing that the inspection is part of a systematic schedule of inspections, will request an administrative warrant entitling the inspector to enter upon the premises. Upon presentation of the administrative warrant and proper credentials, or possession of same in the case of unoccupied premises, the inspector may enter upon the premises, using such reasonable force as may be necessary to gain entry. 
(3)  For purposes of this subsection, "probable cause" exists where the facts and circumstances within the inspector's knowledge are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the inspection is part of a systematic schedule of inspections, that it is a condition of the required registration of rental property, and that the tenant or other person having ownership or control over the dwelling unit has refused to grant the inspector entry upon the property, or that a violation of the rental maintenance code may exist. The applicant for an administrative warrant will not be required to demonstrate specific knowledge of the condition of the particular premises in issue in order to obtain an administrative warrant. 
(c)  Unlawful resistance. It shall be unlawful for any owner, occupant, or person in charge or control of any dwelling unit to deny entry to an inspector acting pursuant to a court order issued as provided in this section or otherwise acquired in accordance with law.

Service shall be upon the individual in person or by leaving a copy of the notice: 
(1)  At such person's residence with an individual 18 years of age or older being a member of the family or cohabitant; or 
(2)  At such person's place of business with an employee of the business. 
(3)  If personal service cannot be effected, notice shall be given by posting the premises, if possible, or if not possible, by posting such notice at the City of Federal Heights Municipal Building (city hall). A copy of the notice shall also be mailed to such person's last known address. 
(4)  If service of the notice is to any person other than the property owner, or if the property is posted, a copy of the notice shall be mailed via United States mail to the owner of record. 
(b)  The notice shall advise of the nature of the nuisance and demand elimination or discontinuance thereof within 72 hours, or such other period of time as may be stated therein, from the time of service. The notice shall also advise that if elimination or discontinuance is not so accomplished within the stated time, the city may proceed to abate the same, charging the expenses thereof to the person(s) refusing to eliminate or discontinue the nuisance and/or may proceed with civil or criminal proceedings. 
(c)  Service of the notice and demand shall be a prerequisite to the commencement of civil or criminal proceedings by the city, except for situations involving summary abatement. The fact that the person or entity against whom legal action is initiated does not actually receive such notice shall not preclude such litigation, provided the city has acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably calculated to give notice to the owner, occupant, person having control or agent thereof. 
(d)  When a nuisance has not been voluntarily abated within the time specified in the notice and demand to abate, the city may, pursuant to the municipal court rules of procedure, bring a civil action in the municipal court to have the nuisance declared as such by the court, and for an order enjoining the nuisance or authorizing its restraint, removal, termination or abatement by the owner or the person who caused the nuisance, or the person who allowed the nuisance to be caused or to continue. 
(e)  The action to declare and abate a nuisance shall be brought by the city by the filing of a complaint, which shall be verified or supported by an affidavit. The summons shall be issued and served in accordance with the municipal court rules of procedure. Trial shall be to the court and the city shall have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a nuisance exists or occurred on/or within the property identified in the complaint. 
(1)  The defendants to an action commenced under this article, and the person liable for and subject to the remedies, may include any person owning or claiming any ownership or leasehold interest in the subject property, all tenants and occupants of the subject property, all managers and agents for any person claiming an ownership or leasehold interest in such property, any person committing, conducting, promoting, facilitating or aiding in the commission of a nuisance, and anyone necessary to carry into effect the court's orders. None of these parties shall be deemed necessary or indispensable parties. Any person holding any legal or equitable interest in the property who has not been named as a party-defendant may intervene as a party-defendant. No other person may intervene. 
(2)  A notice of appearance shall be served with the summons and complaint. The appearance date shall be not less than 14 days from the date of service of the summons. The trial shall be held upon the appearance date, unless the court grants, for a period not to exceed ten days, a continuance for good cause shown. 
(3)  The respondent shall file a response on or before the appearance date set forth in the notice of appearance. 
(4)  Upon the date and at the time set for appearance and trial, if the respondent has not filed a response and fails to appear, and if the city shows that proper service was made on the respondent at least 14 days prior to the appearance date, the court may grant such orders as are requested by the city; except that the court shall order enforcement by the city be stayed for ten days and that a copy of the court's order be mailed to the respondent's last known address. Failure to appear on any other date set for trial shall be grounds for entering a default and judgment thereon against a nonappearing party. For good cause shown, and prior to enforcement, the court may set aside an entry of default and the judgment entered thereon. 
(5)  The judgment of the municipal court may be appealed to the Adams County District Court.

(Code 1985, § 6-13-5; Ord. No. 09-03, § 8, 8-4-2009) 
Sec. 30-108. - Enforcement and remedies. 
(a)  Issuance and effect of temporary and permanent abatement orders. The issuance of temporary or permanent abatement orders under this article shall be governed by the municipal court rules of procedure, pertaining to temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, except to the extent of any inconsistency with the provisions of this article, in which event the provisions of this article shall prevail. Temporary abatement orders provided for in this article shall go into effect immediately when served upon the property or party against whom they are directed. Permanent abatement orders shall go into effect as determined by the court. No bond or other security shall be required of the city upon the issuance of any temporary abatement order. 
(b)  Form and scope of abatement orders. Every abatement order under this article shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be reasonably specific in its terms; shall describe in reasonable detail the acts and conditions authorized, required or prohibited; and shall be binding upon the subject property, the parties to the action, their attorneys, agents and employees, and any other person named as a defendant in the nuisance action and served with a copy of the order. 
(c)  Substance of abatement orders. Temporary or permanent abatement orders entered under this article shall be narrowly tailored so as to address the particular kinds of separate violations that form the basis of the alleged nuisance. Such orders may include: 
(1)  Orders requiring any defendant to take steps to abate the nuisance; 
(2)  Orders authorizing city personnel to take reasonable steps to abate the nuisance activity and prevent it from recurring, considering the nature and extent of the violation; 
(3)  Orders prohibiting certain named individuals from entering the property; 
(4)  Orders reasonably necessary to access, maintain or safeguard the property; and/or 
(5)  Orders reasonably necessary for the purposes of abating the nuisance or preventing the nuisance from occurring or recurring; provided, however, that no such order shall require the seizure of, the forfeiture of title to, or the appointment of a special receiver to protect, possess, maintain or operate any property. 
(d)  Temporary abatement orders. 
(1)  The purpose of a temporary abatement order shall be to temporarily abate an alleged nuisance pending the outcome of the matter's judicial proceeding. A temporary abatement order may be issued by the court, even if the effect of such order is to change, rather than preserve, the status quo. 
(2)  At any hearing on a motion for a temporary abatement order, the city shall have the burden of proving that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a nuisance exists or occurred in or on the subject property and, in the case of a temporary order granted without notice to the defendant, that such order is reasonably necessary to avoid immediate, irreparable loss, damage or injury. 
(e)  Permanent abatement orders. Where the existence of a nuisance is established in a civil action under this article, the court shall enter a permanent abatement order requiring the defendant to abate the nuisance and take specific steps to prevent the same and other nuisances from occurring or recurring upon the property. 
(f)  Motion to vacate or modify temporary abatement orders. 
(1)  General. At any time a temporary abatement order is in effect, any defendant or any person holding any legal or equitable interest in any property governed by such order may file a motion to vacate or modify the order. Any motion filed under this subsection shall state specifically the factual and legal grounds upon which it is based, and only those grounds may be considered at the hearing. The court shall vacate the order if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a nuisance was committed or exists in or on the property. The court may modify the order if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that such modification will not be detrimental to the public interest and is appropriate, considering the nature and extent of the violations. 
(2)  Consolidation of hearing with other proceedings. If all parties so stipulate, the court may order the trial on the merits to be advanced and tried with the hearing on these motions. 
(g)  It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to comply or refuse to abide by any of the terms and conditions of a temporary or permanent order issued by the court. 
(Code 1985, § 6-13-6; Ord. No. 09-03, § 9, 8-4-2009) 
Sec. 30-108.5. - Remedies. 
(a)  The city and any defendant to an action under this article, upon the court's approval, may voluntarily stipulate to orders and remedies, temporary, or permanent, that are different from those provided in this article. 
(b)  In any case in which the city prevails in a civil action initiated pursuant to this article, the city may recover its costs and expenses of declaring and abating the nuisance, including reasonable attorney fees and administrative, inspection and legal costs, and all such fees and costs may be assessed against the defendant and become a lien against the subject property pursuant to the procedure set forth in this article. 
(c)  The remedies set forth herein are cumulative. The initiation of any action or the imposition of any penalty hereunder shall not preclude the city from instituting any other proceeding to require compliance with the provisions of this article and with any administrative orders and determinations made hereunder. No provision herein shall be construed to limit or abrogate the right of any person to bring a private action to abate a private nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 09-03, § 10, 8-4-2009) 
Sec. 30-109. - Recovery of expenses. 
(a)  The actual costs and expenses incurred by the city in abating any nuisances, plus actual inspection and administrative costs, shall be assessed upon the property upon which such nuisance is abated. 
(b)  Such costs shall be paid to the city within 30 days after the city has mailed notice of the assessment of such costs by registered or certified mail to the owner of the property; provided, however, that if the property is occupied by someone other than the owner, the city shall mail such notice of assessment by registered or certified mail to both the occupant and the owner. Service shall be complete upon depositing the notice within the United States Postal Service, postage prepaid for certified mail, return receipt requested. Every such assessment shall be a lien in the amount assessed against such property until paid, and shall have priority over all other liens, except general taxes and prior special assessments. 
(c)  In case any assessment is not paid within 30 days after the assessment has been certified to the city's finance director by the city manager, the city's finance director shall then certify to the county treasurer the list of all delinquent assessments, giving the name of the owner as appears of record, the number of lot, block and subdivision, or other legal descriptions sufficient to identify such property upon the records of the county treasurer, and the amount of the assessment. The certification shall be the same in substance and in form as is required for a certification of special assessment. The county treasurer, upon the receipt of a certified list of assessments, is hereby authorized to place those assessments upon the tax list for the current year and to collect those assessments in the same manner as other general taxes are collected with a ten percent penalty thereon; and all the laws of the state for the assessment and collection of general taxes, including the laws for the sale of property for taxes and the redemption thereof, shall apply to and have full force and effect for the collection of such assessments. 
(d)  If the property owner desires to object to the assessment, the owner shall have 30 days from the assessment's date of mailing to file a written objection with the city clerk. The city clerk shall then schedule the matter for a hearing before the city manager. The owner shall be given at least 14 days' written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing. At such hearing, the owner shall have the opportunity to present testimony, witnesses and documents; cross examine any of the city's witnesses or documents; and be represented by legal counsel at the owner's expense. The decision of the city manager shall be final.

If entry is refused, the inspector shall give the owner or occupant, or, if the owner or occupant cannot be located after a reasonable effort, leave at the building or premises a written notice of intention to inspect not sooner than 24 hours after the time specified in the notice. The notice given to the owner or occupant or left on the premises shall state that the property owner or occupant has the right to refuse entry and that in the event such entry is refused, inspection may be made only upon issuance of a search warrant by the municipal judge or by a judge of any other court having jurisdiction. 
(c)  Search warrants . After the expiration of the 24-hour period from the giving or leaving of such notice, the authorized inspector may appear before the municipal court and, upon showing of probable cause by written affidavit, shall obtain a search warrant entitling the inspector to enter the building or upon the premises. Upon presentation of the search warrant and proper credentials, or possession of the same in the case of an unoccupied building or premises, the authorized inspector may enter into the building or upon the premises using such reasonable force as may be necessary to gain entry. 
(d)  Probable cause. The person applying for such warrant shall not be required to demonstrate specific knowledge of the condition of the particular structure or premises at issue in order to obtain a search warrant, but must show some objective facts, or circumstances, which are reasonably trustworthy, that would cause an ordinary prudent person to act. It is unlawful for any owner or occupant of the building or premises to deny entry to any authorized inspector or to resist reasonable force used by an authorized inspector acting pursuant to this section.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, adopted August 20, 2013, repealed the former Art. II, §§ 24-19-24-25, 24-54-24-58, 24-90 and 24-91, and enacted a new Art. II as set out herein. The former Art. II pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1985, §§ 8-12-1-8-12-4 and Ord. No. 07-03, adopted March 6, 2007. 

Sec. 34-19. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. 
(b)  Flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-20. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to critical facilities, infrastructure and other public facilities such as water, sewer and gas mains; electric and communications stations; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-21. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    The following methods may be used to reduce flood losses: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-22. - Definitions. 
    Words and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings subscribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    100-year flood means a flood having a recurrence interval that has a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded during any given year (one-percent-annual-chance flood). The terms "one hundred-year flood" and "one percent chance flood" are synonymous with the term "100-year flood." The term does not imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every 100 years. 
    100-year floodplain means the area of land susceptible to being inundated as a result of the occurrence of a 100-year flood. 
    500-year flood means a flood having a recurrence interval that has a 0.2-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded during any given year (0.2-percent-chance-annual-flood). The term does not imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every 500 years. 
    500-year floodplain means the area of land susceptible to being inundated as a result of the occurrence of a 500-year flood. 
    Addition means any activity that expands the enclosed footprint or increases the square footage of an existing structure. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means a fan-shaped sediment deposit formed by a stream that flows from a steep mountain valley or gorge onto a plain or the junction of a tributary stream with the main stream. Alluvial fans contain active stream channels and boulder bars, and recently abandoned channels. Alluvial fans are predominantly formed by alluvial deposits and are modified by infrequent sheet flood, channel avulsions and other stream processes. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated zone AO or AH on a city's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident.

    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains the flood insurance rate map as well as flood profiles for studied flooding sources that can be used to determine base flood elevations for some areas. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated as the result of a flood, including the area of land over which floodwater would flow from the spillway of a reservoir. 
    Floodplain administrator means the city official designated by the city manager to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain development permit means a permit required before construction or development begins within any special flood hazard area (SFHA). If FEMA has not defined the SFHA within a city, the city shall require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the city including the placement of manufactured homes, so that it may determine whether such construction or other development is proposed within flood-prone areas. Permits are required to ensure that proposed development projects meet the requirements of the NFIP and this floodplain management chapter. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means and includes, but is not limited to, zoning requirements and restrictions, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, nuisance regulations, grading and erosion control requirements and floodplain regulations. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and/or non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. The Colorado statewide standard for the designated height to be used for all newly studied reaches shall be one-half foot (six inches). Letters of map revision to existing floodway delineations may continue to use the floodway criteria in place at the time of the existing floodway delineation. 
    Freeboard means the vertical distance in feet above a predicted water surface elevation intended to provide a margin of safety to compensate for unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood such as debris blockage of bridge openings and the increased runoff due to urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

    Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) means FEMA's modification of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). Any floor used for living purposes which includes working, storage, sleeping, cooking and eating, or recreation or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could be converted to such a use such as a basement or crawl space. The lowest floor is a determinate for the flood insurance premium for a building, home or business. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

    National flood insurance program (NFIP) means FEMA's program of flood insurance coverage and floodplain management administered in conjunction with the Robert T. Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The NFIP has applicable Federal regulations promulgated in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The U.S. Congress established the NFIP in 1968 with the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city. 
    No-rise certification means a record of the results of an engineering analysis conducted to determine whether a project will increase flood heights in a floodway. A no-rise certification must be supported by technical data and signed by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer.

    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, including substantial improvements, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, which is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. The value of the structure shall be determined by the city. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the city's building official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure." 
    Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) means a quantity designated for each chemical on the list of extremely hazardous substances that triggers notification by facilities to the state that such facilities are subject to emergency planning requirements. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirement(s) of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

ARTICLE III. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 34-23. - Application of requirements. 
    The chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas and areas removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-24. - Basis for establishing the special flood hazard area. 
    The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Adams County, Colorado and incorporated areas," dated March 5, 2007, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. These special flood hazard areas identified by the FIS and attendant mapping are the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies designated and approved by the city. The floodplain administrator shall keep a copy of the flood insurance study (FIS), DFIRMs, and/or FIRMs on file and available for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-25. - Establishment of floodplain development permits. 
    A floodplain development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-26. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed within the special flood hazard area without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. These regulations meet the minimum requirements as set forth by the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-27. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    Nothing within this chapter is intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where the requirements of this chapter and any other provision of the Code, or easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-28. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-29. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard area or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013)

(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-33. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of adjustment, as established by the city, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal such decision to the District Court of the County of Adams, State of Colorado. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 34-22 of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(f)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter as stated in article II, section 34-20. 
(g)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(h)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(i)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with any existing local laws or rules or regulations. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(j)  Variances may be issued by a city for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in article IV, section 34-33(1)-(9) are met, and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
ARTICLE V. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 34-34. - General standards. 
    In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(6)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(7)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
(8)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-35. - Specific standards. 
    In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in article III, section 34-24, article IV, section 34-21(7), or article V, section 34-40, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer, architect, or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the floodplain administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. With the exception of critical facilities, outlined in article V, section 34-41, new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that at one foot above the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
A registered Colorado Professional Engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. Such certification shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator, as proposed in article IV, section 34-32. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision in which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of the above paragraph, shall be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot above the base flood elevation, or 
b.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of article IV, section 34-42, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-36. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the special flood hazard area established in article III, section 34-25, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Residential construction. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the city's FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified). Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer, architect, or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the floodplain administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. With the exception of critical facilities, outlined in article V, section 34-41, all new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures, must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the city's FIRM (at least three feet if no depth number is specified), or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one foot above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. A registered Colorado Professional Engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in article IV, section 34-32, are satisfied. 
Within zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes are required to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-37. - Floodways. 
    Floodways are administrative limits and tools used to regulate existing and future floodplain development. The State of Colorado has adopted floodway standards that are more stringent than the FEMA minimum standard (see definition of floodway in article II). Located within special flood hazard area established in article III, section 34-24, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a licensed Colorado Professional Engineer and in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase (requires a no-rise certification) in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, the city may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the city first applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-38. - Alteration of a watercourse. 
    For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse within a special flood hazard area, the following standards apply: 
(1)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall appropriately consider issues of sediment transport, erosion, deposition, and channel migration and properly mitigate potential problems through the project as well as upstream and downstream of any improvement activity. A detailed analysis of sediment transport and overall channel stability should be considered, when appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design. 
(2)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall evaluate the residual 100-year floodplain. 
(3)  Any channelization or other stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory floodplain and be in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local floodplain rules, regulations and laws. 
(4)  Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer or Certified Professional Hydrologist. 
(5)  All activities within the regulatory floodplain shall meet all applicable federal, state and city floodplain requirements and regulations. 
(6)  Within the regulatory floodway, stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the project proponent demonstrates through a floodway analysis and report, sealed by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer, that there is not more than a 0.00-foot rise in the proposed conditions compared to existing conditions floodway resulting from the project, otherwise known as a no-rise certification, unless the city first applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision in accordance with section 34-37 of this article. 
(7)  Maintenance shall be required for any altered or relocated portions of watercourses so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-39. - Properties removed from the floodplain by fill. 
    A floodplain development permit shall not be issued for the construction of a new structure or addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F), unless such new structure or addition complies with the following: 
(1)  Residential construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that the structure or addition is watertight to at least one foot above the base flood level that existed prior to the placement of fill with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-40. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision or other development proposal is in a flood-prone area, the proposal shall minimize flood damage. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of article III, section 34-25; article IV, section 34-32, and the provisions of article V of this chapter. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to article III, section 34-24, or article IV, section 34-31 of this chapter. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 13-14, § 1, 8-20-2013) 
Sec. 34-41. - Standards for critical facilities. 
    A critical facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that if flooded may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the city at any time before, during and after a flood. 
(1)  Classification of critical facilities. It is the responsibility of the city to identify and confirm that specific structures in the city meet the following criteria: 
Critical facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) essential services; (b) hazardous materials; (c) at-risk populations; and (d) vital to restoring normal services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities, and transportation lifelines. 
These facilities consist of: 
1.  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage, and, emergency operation centers); 
2.  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions, and non-ambulatory surgical structures but excluding clinics, doctors offices, and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
3.  Designated emergency shelters; 
4.  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio, and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables, and conduits); 
5.  Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines, and service lines); and 
6.  Air transportation lifelines (airports, municipal and larger), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure (aviation control towers, air traffic control centers, and emergency equipment aircraft hangars). 
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), non-potable water treatment and distribution systems, and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances. 
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of city council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to city council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. 
These facilities may include: 
1.  Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing); 
2.  Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials; 
3.  Refineries; 
4.  Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and 
5.  Above ground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers. 
Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place, AND the chemical(s) is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either 500 pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the 356 chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010), also known as extremely hazardous substances (EHS); or 10,000 pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R. § 302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R. § 1910 (2010) shall govern and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation this chapter, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations. 
Specific exemptions to this category include: 
1.  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
2.  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the city) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
3.  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. 
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this article. 
c.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care, and schools. 
These facilities consist of: 
1.  Elder care (nursing homes);

c.  Manifestly endeavors to conceal him or herself or any object; 
d.  Not being duly authorized security personnel or a peace officer, systematically checks the means to access to buildings or vehicles in the immediate area; or

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, adopted April 17, 2018, repealed the former article II, §§ 46-21-46-32, and enacted a new article II as set out herein.

Sec. 46-21. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Purpose. This article provides principles, procedures and associated funding for the placement of structures and facilities, construction excavation encroachments and work activities within or upon any public right-of-way, and to protect the integrity of the road system. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require permits of private users of the public rights-of-way, to establish permit procedures and to fix and collect fees and charges. 
(b)  Objectives. Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for location of facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the city must insure that the primary purpose of the right-of-way, passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the value of other public and private installations, roadways, facilities and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. The use of the right-of-way corridors by private users is secondary to these public objectives, and the movement of traffic. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of rights-of-way for location of facilities by public and private entities by: 
(1)  Insuring that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized. 
(2)  Protecting the city's infrastructure investment by establishing repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public rights-of-way, when work is accomplished. 
(3)  Facilitating work within the rights-of-way through the standardization of regulations. 
(4)  Maintaining an efficient permit process. 
(5)  Conserving and fairly apportioning the limited physical capacity of the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the city. 
(6)  Establishing a public policy for enabling the city to discharge its public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition and technological development. 
(7)  Promoting cooperation among the permittees (as defined herein) and the city in the occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to (i) eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly, (ii) lower the permittee's and the city's costs of providing services to the public, and (iii) minimize street cuts. 
(8)  Assuring that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

(c)  The two-year warranty period shall run from the date of the city's acceptance of the work. If repairs are required during the two-year warranty period, those repairs need only be warranted until the end of the initial two-year period starting from the date of acceptance. It is not necessary that a new two-year warranty be provided for subsequent repairs after acceptance. 
(d)  At any time prior to completion of the two-year warranty period, the city may notify the permittee in writing of any needed repairs. Such repairs shall be completed within 24 hours if the defects are determined by the city to be an imminent danger to the public health, safety and welfare. Non-emergency repairs shall be completed within 30 days after notice. 
(e)  The warranty described in this section shall cover only those areas of work undertaken by a permittee, and not directly impacted by the work of any other permittee or the city.

(Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 46-30. - Inspections. 
    A minimum of three inspections shall take place. First, the permittee shall request that the city conduct a pre-construction inspection, to determine any necessary conditions for the permit. Second, the permittee shall notify the city 48 hours prior to the commencement of work operations at which time the city shall schedule an inspection. The city shall inspect the completed work and acceptance will be made if all work meets city and permit standards. Third, approximately 30 days prior to the expiration of the two-year guarantee, the city may conduct a post-construction inspection of the completed work. If the work is still satisfactory the bond or letter of credit shall be returned or allowed to expire, with a letter of final acceptance, less any amounts needed to complete work not done by permittee. Upon review of the application for a permit, the director shall determine how many additional inspections, if any, may be required. For work which does not involve material disturbance in the rights-of-way, the director shall waive the final inspection and the performance bond/letter of credit. 
(Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 46-31. - Public safety. 
    The permittee shall maintain a safe work area, free of safety hazards. The city may make any repair necessary to eliminate any safety hazards not performed as directed.

Any deficiencies noted by the city shall be corrected immediately by the contractor. If contractor is not available or cannot be found, the city may make such corrections and the contractor shall pay the actual costs plus a penalty of 50 percent of the amount thereof. 
(Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 46-34. - General rights-of-way use and construction. 
(a)  Right-of-way meetings. Permittee shall attend and participate in meetings of the city, of which the permittee is made aware, regarding right-of-way issues that may impact its facilities, including, planning meetings to anticipate joint trenching and boring. Whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable to joint trench or share bores or cuts, permittee shall work with other providers, licensees, permittees, and franchisees so as to reduce so far as possible the number of right-of-way cuts within the city and the amount of pedestrian and vehicular traffic that is obstructed or impeded. 
(b)  Minimal interference. Work in the right-of-way, on other public property, near public property, or on or near private property shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. Permittee's facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner as not to interfere with any other property of the city, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the rights-of-way by, or under, the city's authority. The permittee's facilities shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere with new improvements the city may deem proper to make or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the rights-of-way or other public property, and shall not interfere with the travel and use of public places by the public during the construction, repair, operation or removal thereof, and shall not obstruct or impede traffic. 
(c)  Underground construction and use of poles. 
(1)  When required by the ordinances, resolutions, regulations or rules of the city or applicable state or federal law, permittee's facilities shall be placed underground at no cost to the city. Placing facilities underground does not preclude the use of ground-mounted appurtenances. 
(2)  Where all facilities are installed underground at the time of permittee's construction, or when all such facilities are subsequently placed underground, all permittee facilities shall also be placed underground at no expense to the city unless funding is generally available for such relocation to all users of the rights-of-way. Related equipment, such as pedestals, must be placed in accordance with the city's applicable ordinances and building code requirements and rules. In areas where existing facilities are aerial, the permittee may only install aerial facilities in locations not designated for facility undergrounding. 
(3)  For above ground facilities, the permittee shall utilize existing poles and conduit wherever possible. 
(4)  Should the city desire to place its own facilities in trenches or bores opened by the permittee, the permittee shall cooperate with the city in any construction by the permittee that involves trenching or boring, provided that the city has first notified the permittee in some manner that it is interested in sharing the trenches or bores in the area where the permittee's construction is occurring. The permittee shall allow the city to place its facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, provided the city incurs any incremental increase in cost of the trenching and boring. Should the city desire to install ducts or conduit for the possible use of other entities, then the permittee shall allow the city to place these facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, provided the city shares proportionally in the cost of trenching and boring. The city shall be responsible for maintaining its respective facilities buried in the permittee's trenches and bores under this paragraph. 
(d)  Use of conduits by the city. Unless otherwise restricted by tariff, the city may install or affix and maintain its own facilities for city purposes in or upon any and all of permittee's ducts, conduits or equipment in the rights-of-way and other public places, at a charge to be negotiated between the parties, to the extent space therein or thereon is reasonably available, and pursuant to all applicable ordinances, regulations and building codes. For the purposes of this subsection, "city purposes" includes, but is not limited to, the use of the structures and installations for city fire, police, traffic, water, telephone, and/or signal systems. 
(e)  Common users. The rights-of-way have a finite capacity for containing facilities. Therefore, whenever the city determines it is impracticable, for reasons to include but not limited to the existence of other providers facilities in the rights-of-way, to permit construction of an underground conduit system by any other entity which may at the time have authority to construct or maintain conduits or ducts in the rights-of-way, but excluding entities providing services in competition with permittee, and unless otherwise prohibited by federal or state law or regulations, the city may require permittee to afford to such entity the right to use permittee's surplus ducts or conduits in common with permittee, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement for use of surplus ducts or conduits entered into by permittee and the other entity. Nothing herein shall require permittee to enter into an agreement with such entity if, in permittee's reasonable determination, such an agreement could compromise the integrity of the permittee's facilities. 
(f)  All facilities shall meet any applicable local, state, and federal clearance and other safety requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of contracts executed between permittee and the other common user. Permittee may, at its option, correct any attachment deficiencies and charge the common user for its costs. Each common user shall pay permittee for any fines, fees, damages or other costs the common user's attachments cause permittee to incur. 
(Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 46-35. - Joint planning and construction; coordination of excavations. 
(a)  Excavations in city rights-of-way disrupt and interfere with the public use of city streets and damage the pavement and landscaping. The purpose of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting better coordination among permittees making excavations in city rights-of-way and between these permittees and the city. Coordination will assist in minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever feasible, and will ensure the excavations in city rights-of-way are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing of the streets by the city. 
(b)  Any permittee owning, operating or installing facilities in city rights-of-way, providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video or other utility services, shall meet annually with the director, at the director's request to discuss permittee's excavation master plan. At such meeting, to the extent not already in possession of the city, permittee shall submit documentation, in a form required by the director, showing a location of the permittee's existing facilities in the city rights-of-way. Permittee shall discuss with the director, its excavation master plan, and identify planned major excavation work in the city. The director may make his or her own record on a map, drawing or other documentation, of each permittee's planned major excavation work in the city; provided, however, that no such document prepared by the director shall identify a particular entity, or the planned major excavation work of that particular entity. Permittee shall meet with the director to discuss an initial excavation master plan no later than 60 days after submitting its first permit application. Thereafter, each permittee shall submit annually, on the first regular business day of January, a revised and updated excavation master plan. Such revised and updated plan shall be submitted in both hard copy and digital format. As used in this subsection, the term "planned major excavation work" refers to any future excavations planned by the permittee when the excavation master plan or update is submitted that will affect any city right-of-way for more than five days, provided that the permittee shall not be required to identify future major excavations planned to occur more than three years after the date that the permittee's master plan or update is discussed. Between the annual meetings to discuss planned major excavation work, permittee shall use its best efforts to inform the director of any substantial changes in the planned major excavation work discussed at the annual meeting. 
(c)  The director shall prepare a repaving plan showing the street resurfacing planned by the city. For purposes of this section, the repaving plan shall include a landscaping or other right-of-way improvement plan. The repaving plan shall be revised and updated on an annual basis after meeting to discuss the permittee's and city department's master plans and updates. The director shall make the city's repaving plan available for public inspection. In addition, after determining the street resurfacing work that is proposed for each year, the director shall send a notice of the proposed work to all permittees that have had an annual meeting with the director. 
(d)  Prior to applying for a permit, any person planning to excavate in the city's rights-of-way shall review the city's repaving plan on file with the director and shall coordinate, to the extent practicable, with the utility and street work shown on such plans to minimize damage to, and avoid undue disruption and interference with the public use of such rights-of-way. 
(e)  In performing location of facilities in the public rights-of-way in preparation for construction under a permit, permittee shall compile all information obtained regarding its or any other facilities in the public rights-of-way related to a particular permit, and shall make that information available to the city in a written and verified format acceptable to the director. If the permittee fails to provide the locate information requested by the city, the city may obtain this information and charge the permittee the actual costs for obtaining the information. 
(f)  Prior to undertaking any work in the rights-of-way or related landscaping, the city may notify all permittees of the city work to be performed. Upon such notification, all permittees shall, within seven days, locate their facilities in the rights-of-way in which the work will be performed, and provide documentation in a format acceptable to the director of the permittee's facilities in that right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 46-36. - Minimizing the impacts of work in the rights-of-way. 
(a)  Relocation and protection of utilities. Before beginning excavation in any public way, a permittee shall contact the Utility Notification Center of Colorado (UNCC) and, to the extent required by Excavation Requirement, C.R.S. § 9-1.5-101 et seq., as may be amended, make inquiries of all ditch companies, utility companies, districts, local government departments, and all other agencies that might have facilities in the area of work to determine possible conflicts. 
    The permittee shall contact the UNCC and all Tier 2 facilities to request field locations of all facilities in the area pursuant to UNCC requirements. Field locations shall be marked prior to commencing work. The permittee shall support and protect all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be affected by the work from damage during construction or settlement of trenches subsequent to construction. 
    A minimum of 18-inch vertical clearance and 24-inch horizontal clearance is required as related to the crossing or parallel alignment with any city utilities. Televising and video recording shall be required for all sanitary and storm sewer pipe crossings when on-site visual inspections are unable to verify the work has been completed without damage to those facilities. 
(b)  Noise, dust, debris, hours of work. Each permittee shall conduct work in such manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and occupants of neighboring property. In the performance of the work, the permittee shall take appropriate measures to reduce noise, dust, and unsightly debris. No work shall be done between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. nor at any time on Saturday, Sunday or national holidays except with the written permission of the director, or in case of an emergency. 
(c)  Trash and construction materials. Each permittee shall maintain the work site so that: 
(1)  Trash and construction materials are contained so that they are not blown off of the construction site. 
(2)  Trash is removed from a construction site often enough so that it does not become a nuisance, health, fire, or safety hazard. 
(3)  Trash dumpsters and storage or construction trailers are not placed in the street without specific approval of the director and shall only be allowed in areas that are protected from adjacent traffic and do not create sight distance safety concerns. 
(d)  Deposit of dirt and material on roadways. Each permittee shall utilize their best efforts to eliminate the tracking of mud or debris upon any street or sidewalk. Streets and sidewalks shall be cleaned of mud and debris at the end of each day. All equipment and trucks tracking mud and debris into the right-of-way shall be cleaned of mud and debris at the end of each day or as directed by the director. 
(e)  Protection of trees and landscaping. Each permittee shall protect trees, landscape, and landscape features as required by the city. All protective measures shall be provided at the expense of the permittee. 
(f)  Protection of paved surfaces from equipment damage. Backhoe equipment outriggers shall be fitted with rubber pads whenever outriggers are placed on any paved surface. Tracked vehicles that will damage pavement surfaces are not permitted on paved surface unless specific precautions are taken to protect the surface. The permittee shall be responsible for any damage caused to the pavement by the operation of such equipment and, shall repair such surfaces. Failure to do so will result in the calling of the permittee's performance/warranty guarantee by the city to repair any damage, and, possibly, at the discretion of the director the requirement of additional warranty(s). 
(g)  Protection of property. Each permittee shall protect from injury any adjoining property by providing adequate support and taking other necessary measures. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the work, and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property resulting from failure to properly protect and carry out work in the public way. 
(h)  Clean-up. As the work progresses, all public rights-of-way and private property shall be regularly cleaned of all rubbish, excess dirt, rock, and other debris. All clean-up operations shall be done at the expense of the permittee. 
(i)  Preservation of monuments. A permittee shall not disturb any surface monuments, property marks or survey hubs and points found on the line of work unless written approval is obtained from the director. Any monuments, hubs, and points disturbed will be replaced by a Colorado Registered Land Surveyor at the permittee's expense. 
(j)  Each permittee shall make provisions for employee and construction vehicle parking so that neighborhood parking adjacent to a work site is not impacted. 
(k)  Each permittee shall maintain an adequate and safe unobstructed walkway around a construction site or blocked sidewalk. 
(l)  Each permittee shall clear all snow and ice hazards from public sidewalks at the work site in conformance with the city's ordinances.

(Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 46-37. - Standards for repairs and restoration. 
(a)  Permittee responsibility. The permittee shall be fully responsible for the cost and actual performance of all work in the public way. The permittee shall do all work in conformance with any and all engineering regulations, construction specifications, and design standards adopted by the city. These standards shall apply to all work in the public way unless otherwise indicated in the permit. 
(b)  All restoration shall result in a work site condition equal to or better than that which existed prior to construction. In addition to the regulations, specifications and standards referred to in subsection (a) the following provisions shall apply to work in the city public rights-of-way. 
(1)  Pavement cuts shall be filled with compacted select material. Either concrete or asphalt patches will be placed to match the existing street cross section. Select material shall include select fill, Colorado Department of Transportation Class 6 Roadbase or controlled density (flowable) fill. 
(2)  Select fill shall be placed in an excavation to the density required by city compaction specifications. 
(3)  Flowable fill backfill material, satisfying design and construction standards adopted by the city, shall be used to restore all trenches that have been excavated in the paved portion of any public street or alley. For trench excavations in excess of five feet in depth, the applicant may utilize granular backfill material in lieu of flowable fill backfill material, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied. 
(4)  Prior to the issuance of a permit for construction, excavation, or work activity, in the public right-of-way, the applicant must request and receive approval for the use of granular backfill material. 
(5)  The type, gradation, placement, compaction, and testing of the granular backfill material shall meet or exceed all requirements specified in design and construction standards adopted by the city. 
(6)  In cases where it is impossible to achieve the compaction required by the city's specifications on select fill, the city encourages the use of controlled density fill or flash fill material. When controlled density fill type material is used, steel plate will be placed to cover the opening for the time required to allow the material to set. 
(7)  Once the compacted backfill has been placed, an asphalt cutback shall be made. The cutback will extend 12 inches minimum on each side of the opening and will be over undisturbed pavement material (two-inch deep minimum). All edges of the opening shall be neatly cut with an asphalt saw at 90 degrees to traffic and uniformly tacked. 
(8)  The new asphalt will be placed in lifts (three inches maximum) and compacted upon placement. Asphalt depths will be governed by the existing cross section of the street but not less than six inches of full depth asphalt shall be used to fill a street cut regardless of the existing cross section. Concrete meeting all construction standards of the city shall be used to replace concrete pavement wherever it occurs. 
(Ord. No. 18-06, § 1, 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 46-38. - Construction and restoration standards for newly constructed or overlayed streets.

(1)  Application. Any application for a permit to excavate in a public right-of-way subject to the requirements of this section shall contain the following information: 
a.  A detailed and dimensional engineering plan that identifies and accurately represents the city rights-of-way or property that will be impacted by the proposed excavation, as well as adjacent streets, and the method of construction. 
b.  The street width or alley width including curb and gutter over the total length of each city block that will be impacted by the proposed excavation. 
c.  The location, width, length, and depth of the proposed excavation and location and total number of any core holes required for utilities location verification. 
d.  The total area of existing street or alley pavement in each individual city block that will be impacted by the proposed excavation. 
e.  A written statement addressing the criteria for approval. 
(2)  Criteria for approval. No permit for excavation in the right-of-way of new streets shall be approved unless the director finds that all of the following criteria have been met: 
a.  Boring or jacking without disturbing the pavement is not practical due to physical characteristics of the street or alley or other utility conflicts. 
b.  Alternative utility alignments that do not involve excavating the street or alley are found to be impracticable. 
The proposed excavation cannot reasonably be delayed until after the city's two year deferment period has lapsed. 
(3)  Exemptions for emergency operations. Emergency maintenance operations shall be limited to circumstances involving the preservation of life, property, or the restoration of customer service. Persons with prior authorization from the city to perform emergency maintenance operations within the public rights-of-way, shall be exempted from this section.

ARTICLE VII. - UNDERGROUNDING AND RELOCATION OF OVERHEAD TELECOMMUNICATION LINES 

Sec. 46-178. - Legislative findings and declarations. 
(a)  The underground relocation ("undergrounding") of overhead lines, wires and cables used for the distribution of electricity or the transmission of telecommunication services, along with the removal of utility poles from city-owned property serves a wide variety of important public purposes. 
(b)  Undergrounding enhances public safety by: Removing obstructions in the public right-of-way, mitigating the risk of vehicular collisions with utility poles; improving the sight lines for vehicular and pedestrian traffic along roadways; and mitigating the risk of hazards associated with negligent or inadvertent contact with overhead lines. 
(c)  Undergrounding enhances the appearance and aesthetics of the city by: Removing unsightly lines and poles from public view; improving scenic vistas in and around city parks and natural areas, and within the city's residential and commercial neighborhoods generally; and allowing the city's tree canopy to flourish without conflict with overhead utility lines. 
(d)  Undergrounding enhances the safety and security of the electric and telecommunications lines by protecting the lines from damage due to inclement weather or accidents, and thus preserves the continuity and reliability of electric and telecommunications services to the public at large. 
(e)  Coordinated undergrounding projects, in which all affected electric and telecommunication lines are relocated underground at the same time, offer the most efficient way to achieve the benefits of undergrounding at the lowest possible cost for the owners of the lines and their customers. 
(f)  Since August 27, 2007, the city has included within its electric utility franchise certain undergrounding requirements for electric distribution facilities, including the establishment of a fund for electric utility undergrounding projects as directed by the public works director. 
(g)  Since November 1, 2001, the city has included within its cable television franchises undergrounding requirements for cable television lines, requiring the franchisee to relocate its overhead lines underground when other overhead utility lines are being relocated underground. 
(h)  Because other telecommunications companies that maintain overhead lines, including the city's local exchange telephone service provider, have not heretofore been required by any city law or franchise to cooperate and participate in underground relocation projects, on occasion telephone and other telecommunications lines have remained overhead and suspended from utility poles in locations where all other electric distribution and cable television lines have been relocated underground. 
(i)  The continued existence of overhead telecommunications lines and utility poles in a location where all other utilities have been relocated underground compromises public safety and the general welfare of the public. 
(j)  As a home rule city, Federal Heights exercises broad inherent authority to regulate the use of city streets, alleys, parks, parkways, and other city-owned property under its police power. 
(k)  In addition to its home rule authority, the Colorado Constitution and various state statutes recognize the authority of municipalities to regulate the placement of public utility structures and facilities on public property in general, and utility poles and service lines in particular. 
(l)  The Colorado Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the authority of municipalities to require the relocation of public utilities at the utility's expense in conjunction with municipal efforts to improve public property. 
(m)  Pursuant to state statute, C.R.S. § 40-3-115, providers of local exchange telephone service may seek authorization from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to recover from their customers the actual costs associated with the relocation of telephone lines when the relocation has been requested by a political subdivision, which term includes cities.

    Overhead telecommunications lines means aerial wires or cables located upon utility poles and used to deliver any form of telecommunications service. 
    Owner means any person, firm, corporation, association, partnership which has an ownership or leasehold interest in any overhead telecommunication lines.

    Utility pole means any pole or other structure used to suspend overhead telecommunications lines above the surface of the ground. 
(Ord. No. 17-06, § 1, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 46-180. - Underground relocation of overhead telecommunications facilities required. 
(a)  Whenever the director exercises the authority to request the underground relocation of overhead electric distribution facilities under the city's electric utility franchise, the director shall likewise require the owner of any overhead telecommunications facilities to relocate such facilities underground or, at the owner's option, remove the owner's facilities entirely from that location. The owner shall complete any such underground relocation or removal project at the owner's sole expense within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180 days from the date upon which the director makes a written demand upon the owner to relocate or remove the telecommunications facilities. 
(b)  The director may also order the underground relocation or removal of overhead telecommunications facilities in any circumstance where the telecommunications facilities, whether located upon utility poles or otherwise, interfere with the improvement of any public right-of-way or other city-owned property. The owner shall complete any such underground relocation or removal project at the owner's sole expense within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180 days from the date upon which the director makes a written demand upon the owner to relocate or remove the telecommunications facilities. 
(c)  Any proposed underground relocation of overhead electric distribution facilities or telecommunication facilities within a city park will require the review and approval of the director. 
(Ord. No. 17-06, § 1, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 46-181. - Planning undergrounding projects; cooperation with other utilities. 
    Prior to making any written demand for removal or relocation of telecommunications facilities as provided in subsection (a) or (b) of section 46-180, the director shall provide to the owner of any telecommunication facility the same opportunity to be involved in advance planning and scheduling of undergrounding projects as is provided to the owner of the electric utility under the city's electric utility franchise. When undertaking any underground relocation project, the city and the owner shall coordinate with other utilities or companies that have their facilities above ground to attempt to have all facilities undergrounded as part of the same project. The city will enforce the provisions of its electric utility franchise requiring cooperation in the undergrounding of electric distribution facilities and telecommunications facilities as part of the same project where financially, technically and operationally feasible. 
(Ord. No. 17-06, § 1, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 46-182. - Compliance with other city laws and regulations. 
    In complying with the requirements of this article and relocating overhead telecommunications facilities underground, the owner shall be subject to any and all other city laws and regulations, including all relevant permitting requirements associated with excavations, construction, and placement of structures on or under city-owned property, including rights-of-way, to the extent applicable and including any policies adopted by the director with regard to any proposed undergrounding of existing or future utilities in parks. 
(Ord. No. 17-06, § 1, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 46-183. - Unlawful to maintain overhead telecommunications lines or utility poles. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any owner to maintain overhead telecommunications facilities in any location where the director has requested the underground relocation of electric distribution lines under the authority or the city's electric utility franchise, and such electric distribution facilities have in fact been relocated underground. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any owner to maintain overhead telecommunications facilities in any location where the director has ordered the owner to relocate underground or remove the overhead facilities on the basis that overhead facilities interfere with the improvement of any public right-of-way or any other city-owned property. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any owner who maintains overhead telecommunications facilities in violation of the director's written demand to remove such lines and poles in accordance with section 46-180 of this article. 
(d)  In addition to the general penalties provided by the Code, the city may seek any appropriate remedy for damages or equitable relief to secure compliance with this article and to preserve the city's interest in its public property.

When it is determined by the finance director that sales and/or use tax owed to the city have been reported and paid to another municipality, the city shall promptly notify the taxpayer that taxes are being improperly collected or remitted, or both, and that as of the date the notice is mailed, the taxpayer must cease improper tax collections or remittances, or both. 
(d)  Recovery . The city may make a written claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received any tax, penalty or interest, or any combination thereof, owed to the city, or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer. The decision to make a claim for recovery lies in the sole discretion of the finance director. Any claim for recovery made to a municipality shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve or deny, in whole or in part, the claim within 90 days of its receipt. The municipality to which the city submits a claim for recovery may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of such extension by the city shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(e)  Verification/payment . Within 90 days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the finance director shall verify whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied, in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the claim is approved, in whole or in part, the city shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality submitting the claim within 30 days of approval. If a municipality and a taxpayer submit a claim jointly, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. 
(f)  Denial . The city may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the taxpayer.

(1)  If the overpayment is $10.00 or more, a notice of overpayment will be issued. After examining such notice, the taxpayer may submit a claim for refund, report the correct tax due by filing an amended return by the end of the next reporting period, or credit the overpayment to the tax due for the next reporting period.

This penalty shall be in addition to interest at the rate imposed pursuant to this section. 
(c)  Penalty for deficiency due to fraud . If any part of the deficiency is due to fraud with the intent to evade the tax, then there shall be added a penalty 100 percent of the total amount of the deficiency.

(Code 1985, § 3-3-140) 
Sec. 54-47. - Cost of collection. 
    If any person liable for the payment of a tax imposed by this article has repeatedly failed, neglected, or refused to pay the same within the time specified for such payment, and the finance director has been required to exercise enforcement proceedings three or more times through the issuance of a notice of determination, assessment and demand for payment to enforce collection of any such taxes due, the finance director is hereby authorized to assess and collect, in addition to taxes, interest and penalties due, such additional amounts as are necessary to compensate the city for costs incurred in collecting such delinquent taxes, including, without limitation, attorney's fees.

(d)  Notice of filing . Such notice shall be on forms prepared by the finance director and shall be verified by the finance director and may be filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in this state in which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal property, and the filing of such notice shall create a lien on such property in that county and constitute notice thereof. After said notice has been filed, or concurrently therewith or at any time when taxes due are unpaid, whether such notice be filed or not, the finance director may issue a distraint warrant as provided herein. 
(Code 1985, § 3-3-150) 
Sec. 54-49. - Foreclosure by distraint.

(2)  Such warrant shall be issued immediately, if a jeopardy assessment and demand for payment has been issued. 
(c)  Warrant . If the taxpayer does not allow entry to the premises, the finance director shall apply to the municipal court for a warrant authorizing any employee or agent of the city to search for and distrain property located inside the city to enforce the collection of tax liability.

(4)  The property shall be sold at public auction for not less than a fair minimum price and, if the amount bid for the property is less than the fair minimum price so fixed, the property may be declared to be purchased by the city and the city shall file a release of lien thereof. If the city purchases the property, such property may be disposed of as determined by the city. 
(5)  The property may be offered first by bulk bid, then subsequently for bid singularly or by lots, and the city may accept any bid. 
(6)  The property offered for sale may be redeemed, if the owner or possessor or other person holding an unperfected chattel mortgage or other right of possession pays the total tax liability and all collection costs no less than 24 hours before the sale. 
(7)  The city shall issue to each purchaser a certificate of sale that shall be prima facie evidence of its right to make the sale and transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the taxpayer in and to the property sold. 
a.  When the property sold consists of certificates of stock, the certificate of sale shall be notice to any corporation, company, or association to record the transfer on its books and records. 
b.  When the property sold consists of securities or other evidences of debt, the certificate of sale shall be good and valid evidence of title. 
(8)  Any surplus remaining after satisfaction of the total tax liability plus any costs of making the distraint and advertising the sale may be distributed by the city: first, to other jurisdictions which have filed liens or claims of sales and use or personal property ad valorem taxes and second, to the owner, or such other person having a legal right thereto. 
(e)  Exempt property . Property of the taxpayer subject to distraint shall include the personal property of the taxpayer and the goods, stock in trade and business fixtures owned or used by any taxpayer including those used under lease, installment sale, or other contract arrangement. Property exempt from distraint and sale shall include the following: 
(1)  The personal property of an owner who has made a bona fide lease to a taxpayer shall be exempt, if such property can reasonably be identified from the lease description and if the lessee is not provided a right to become the owner of the property leased.

(2)  Motor vehicles which are properly registered in the state, designating the lessor as owner thereof, shall be exempt from such lien except that such lien shall apply to the extent that the lessee has an earned reserve or allowance for depreciation not to exceed the fair market value, or similar interest which is or may be credited to the lessee.

(2)  The fact finder shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision of the petition. If the fact finder determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, in favor of the taxpayer or other petitioner, the property shall be returned.

Any tax so assessed shall be due and payable immediately. 
(b)  Stay . Enforcement of a jeopardy assessment and demand for payment may be stayed, if the taxpayer gives security for payment that is satisfactory to the finance director.

(Code 1985, § 3-3-160) 
Sec. 54-51. - Recovery by action at law. 
(a)  Remedies . In addition to other remedies provided in this article, the finance director may treat any such taxes, penalties or interest due and unpaid as a debt due to the city from the taxpayer.

The return filed by the taxpayer or the notice of determination, assessment and demand for payment issued by the finance director is prima facie proof of the amount due. 
(b)  Recovery . To recover such taxes, penalties or interest due, the finance director may bring an action in attachment, and a writ of attachment may be issued to the revenue collector, law enforcement officer or sheriff. In any such proceeding, no bond shall be required of the city, nor shall any sheriff require of the city an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment or writ of execution upon any judgment entered in such proceedings. The city may prosecute appeals in such cases without the necessity of providing bond thereof. 
(c)  Parties . In any action affecting title to real estate or the ownership or rights to possession of personal property, the city may be made a party defendant for the purpose of obtaining an adjudication or determination of its lien upon the property involved therein. 
(Code 1985, § 3-3-165) 
Sec. 54-52. - Other remedies; compromise. 
(a)  Foreclosure . In lieu of seizure of property pursuant to a distraint warrant, the finance director may cause a civil action to be filed in the county district court to enforce the city's lien for such tax upon the real property situated in that county or in any other county in the state, which may be subject to such lien, or to subject any real property or any right, title or interest in real property for the payment of such tax. 
(b)  Payment . The finance director may deem any taxes, penalties or interest due and unpaid as a debt due the city from the taxpayer. 
(1)  In case of failure to pay the taxes, or any portion thereof, or any penalty or interest thereon, when due, the finance director may recover at law the amount of such taxes, penalties and interest, the costs of collection and attorney's fees incurred by the city, in the municipal court or in any county or district court where venue is proper. 
(2)  The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the city, as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof of the amount due. 
(c)  Receivership, bankruptcy and assignment . Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer subject to this article is subject to receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized under distraint for property taxes, all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by this article and for which the taxpayer is in any way liable under the terms of this article shall be a prior and preferred lien against all the property of the taxpayer. No sheriff, receiver, assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person subject to this article under process or order of any court without first ascertaining from the finance director the amount of any taxes due under this article. If any tax is due, the officer shall pay the amount of the taxes out of the proceeds, less costs and attorney's fees before making payment to any judgment creditor or other claimants. 
(d)  Remedy . Nothing contained herein shall preclude the finance director from instituting a legal or equitable action in the county district court for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of this article. In the event such an action is undertaken, the city shall, if it prevails, be entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs of litigation expended in said action as a portion of its judgment rendered therein. 
(e)  Parties . In any action affecting the title to real estate or the ownership or rights to possession of personal property, the city may be made a party defendant for the purpose of obtaining an adjudication or determination of its lien upon the property involved therein. 
(f)  Settlement . For the purpose of facilitating settlement and distribution of estates, trusts, receivership, other fiduciary relationships and the assets of corporations in the process of dissolution or that have been dissolved, the finance director may agree with the fiduciary or surviving corporate directors upon an amount of taxes due from the decedent or from the decedent's estate, the trust, receivership or other fiduciary relationship, or corporation for any periods of tax liability under this article. Payment in accordance with such agreement fully satisfies the tax liability for the periods that the agreement covers, unless the taxpayer has committed fraud or malfeasance or misrepresented a material fact regarding the tax or liability therefor. 
(1)  Any personal representative of a decedent or the estate of a decedent, any trustee, receiver, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, or any director of a corporation in the process of dissolution or that has been dissolved shall first pay taxes under this article due from such decedent, decedent's estate, trust estate, receivership, or corporation before distributing the estate or fund under such person's control. Any such person who fails to pay taxes assessed within the periods authorized by this article is personally liable to the extent of the property distributed by such person for any unpaid taxes of the decedent, decedent's estate, trust estate, receivership, or corporation imposed by or due under this article. 
(2)  Any distributee of a decedent's estate, a trust estate, or fund and the stockholder of any dissolved corporation who receives any of the property of such decedent's estate, trust estate, fund, or corporation is personally liable for taxes assessed pursuant to this article to the same extent that the decedent, trust estate, fund, or corporation is liable under this article. 
(g)  Other remedies . No provision of this article shall preclude the city from utilizing any other lawful penalties or other remedies applicable to the collection of sales or use taxes and being entitled to costs and attorney's fees related thereto. 
(Code 1985, § 3-3-170) 
Sec. 54-53. - Assessment of taxes; deficiency notice; taxpayer remedies. 
(a)  Estimation of tax . If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to collect the tax, or to make a return, or to pay in full the tax required by this article, then the finance director, based upon the available information, shall make an estimate of the tax due. In addition to the estimate there shall be penalties imposed and interest as provided in this article. 
(b)  Notice of delinquency . The finance director shall give the delinquent taxpayer written notice of determination, assessment and demand for payment, which notice shall be served personally or by certified mail, and which assessment of the deficiency amount shall be due and payable 20 days after service or mailing of such notice. If the taxpayer cannot be located, the city may serve notice by posting such notice in a conspicuous place at the business location as stated on the sales tax or business license. Taxpayers have the duty to keep the city informed as to their current address. If such tax deficiency amount, penalty and interest is not paid, or no demand for hearing under this article is made within 20 days after the notice of determination, assessment and demand for payment is mailed or personally delivered to the taxpayer, the right of protest of such amount shall be considered waived and such assessment shall be final. Such waiver shall include the right to contest such liability either administratively with the finance director or the executive director of the state department of revenue pursuant to state statute or by judicial review pursuant to state statute. 
(c)  Notice of hearing . The notice of demand for hearing shall be addressed to the finance director and include the name, business address and license number of the taxpayer, the taxable periods and amounts subject to dispute and a statement of the grounds for the dispute. The notice of demand shall serve to stay the sale under any distraint warrant until conclusion of the hearing and all appeals.

Subject to the city manager's determination, the hearing shall be held before the finance director or a hearing officer appointed by the city manager who possesses education and/or experience in such matters. In the event that it is determined that the taxpayer's liability is less than the amount in the possession of the finance director, such excess shall be paid to the taxpayer by the city. 
(e)  Hearing . The hearing shall be informal and no transcript, rules of evidence or filing of legal briefs shall be required, but the taxpayer and the city may elect to submit written information and present informal witness testimony. The hearing shall be held and a written decision issued within 60 days after the receipt of the taxpayer's written request therefor. The finance director or hearing officer may extend such period, if the delay in holding the hearing or issuing the decision thereon was occasioned by the taxpayer. In any such event, the hearing shall be held and a written decision issued within 120 days of the taxpayer's request in writing therefor. 
(f)  Appeal . If the dispute is not resolved by the informal hearing, the taxpayer, pursuant to state statute, may elect to pursue one of the following procedures of appeal within 30 days of the city's final decision: 
(1)  The taxpayer may request a formal hearing before a hearing officer, who shall be a neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties. The hearing shall be held within 60 days of the taxpayer's request. The costs for the hearing officer and record, if any, shall be divided equally between the city and the taxpayer. 
a.  The formal hearing shall be in accordance with the procedure set forth in chapter II, article X. The taxpayer may, at the taxpayer's expense, be represented by legal counsel. 
b.  Upon the city's notice to the taxpayer of the formal hearing, the taxpayer shall deposit with the city 50 percent of the amount of the tax deficiency in dispute. The taxpayer shall also pay to the city all tax amounts and related penalties and interest not in dispute. The taxpayer may request permission of the finance director to post security or a bond in lieu of cash payment of the amount in dispute, which request shall be granted by the finance director, if the director determines the bond or security is adequate to protect the city's interest. Failure to post the cash or security shall result in denial of the taxpayer's appeal. 
c.  In the event the final decision denies the taxpayer's claims, such taxes, penalties and interest shall become immediately payable without further notice of demand for payment by the city. The city may use all lawful remedies to collect unpaid taxes, penalties and interest. 
d.  Any appeal from the decision rendered after such formal hearing shall be pursuant to Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(2)  The taxpayer may request the executive director of the state department of revenue to conduct a hearing in accordance with state statute. 
(3)  The taxpayer may appeal the city's decision to the county district court, if the criteria of the applicable state statute are met. 
(g)  Administrative remedies . The taxpayer shall have no right to any form of appeal pursuant to this section, if the taxpayer has not exhausted administrative remedies or fails to pursue one of the foregoing methods of appeal within the time prescribed herein. For the purposes of this section, the term "exhaustion of administrative remedies" means the taxpayer has timely requested in writing an informal hearing before the finance director, and the finance director (or hearing officer) has held such hearing and issued a written decision; or the taxpayer has timely requested in writing an informal hearing before the finance director, and the finance director (or hearing officer) has failed to hold such hearing or has failed to issue a final written decision within the time period described herein. 
(h)  Final decision . In the event the city's final decision denies the taxpayer's claims, such taxes, penalties and interest unpaid shall become immediately payable without further notice of demand for payment by the city. The city may use all lawful remedies to collect unpaid taxes, penalties and interest.

Sec. 62-145. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
(b)  When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and/or the pretreatment program; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for the use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
(c)  Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency, excepting the Metro District, or to the general public by the city until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user. 
(Code 1985, § 9-5-16) 
Sec. 62-146. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, wastewater contribution permit, or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained herein, the city manager may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city manager by the user. 
(b)  Consent orders. The city is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Compliance orders or schedules. When the city manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standards or requirements, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified period of time. If the user does not come into compliance within this time period, sewer service may be discontinued. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Suspension of service. 
(1)  The city manager may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city manager or the Metro District, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the Metro District to violate any condition of its CDPS or NPDES permit. 
(2)  Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city manager within 15 days of the date of occurrence. 
(e)  Revocation of permit. Any user who violates any conditions of this article, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked. Grounds for permit revocation include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(2)  Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
(4)  Violation of conditions of the permit. 
(f)  Administrative penalties. Notwithstanding any other section of this article, any user that is found to have violated any provision of this article, its wastewater contribution permit, orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be assessed penalties in an amount not to exceed $1000.00. Such penalties shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge violations, penalties shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. Assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city shall have such collection remedies as may be available for other service charges and fees including a lien against the property served. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. 
(g)  Civil penalties. Any user who is found to have violated an order of the city council or who willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this article, and the order, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000.00 for each offense. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this article or the order, rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder. 
(h)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or wastewater contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both. 
(i)  Hearings. Users desiring to dispute penalties or any other administrative enforcement remedies must file a written request for the city manager to consider the remedy within ten days of being notified of the remedy. The city manager shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of receiving the request from the user. 
(j)  Show-cause hearing. 
(1)  Upon a finding by the city manager that a person has caused or permitted a unauthorized discharge or that any such unauthorized discharge has not been corrected by timely compliance with a correction schedule, the city manager may order any person who causes or allows such unauthorized discharge to show cause before the city manager why an enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the offending party, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city manager regarding the violation, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the offending party to show cause before the city manager why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by certified mail at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
(2)  The city manager may conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate a representative to:

The transcript so recorded will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the actual charges therefor. 
(4)  Upon review of the evidence by the city manager, the city manager shall make written findings of fact. Thereupon the city manager may: 
a.  Issue an order stating that no unauthorized discharge has occurred and directing that service shall not be terminated therefor; 
b.  Issue an order stating that an unauthorized discharge has occurred and directing that, following a specified time period, the wastewater treatment service of the offending party be discontinued unless: 
1.  Adequate treatment facilities, devices or other appurtenances shall have been installed; 
2.  Existing treatment facilities, devices or other appurtenances are properly operated or maintained; or 
c.  Issue such other or further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 10-06, § 7, adopted Apr. 20, 2010, repealed the former section and enacted a new one as set out herein. The former section pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1985, § 10-7-6. 
Sec. 70-473. - Review criteria. 
    Site development plans shall be approved if they are complete in form, meet all the applicable standards set forth in this section, or elsewhere in this Code and adequately address the following design criteria guidelines (guidelines). The guidelines set forth in this section are intended to provide general guidance in the development and review of site plans and building elevations recognizing that some flexibility is allowed given site specific conditions and the unique circumstances of the application. The decision of approval shall be based upon whether the proposal complies with the development standards established herein and elsewhere in this Code and any other adopted policies, and whether the proposal substantially complies with the guidelines established in this section. Substantial compliance with the guidelines does not require compliance with each of the guidelines, or substantial compliance with each individual guideline, but rather a demonstrated attempt to comply with the guidelines, with the result of compliance with the preponderance of the guidelines in their entirety. Those site development criteria that are reasonable for the intended use shall be required. 
(1)  Vicinity considerations . 
a.  Standards. 
1.  Access to public transit facilities shall be provided for by incorporating bus loading zones where necessary. 
2.  The anticipated traffic impact shall be acceptable for adjacent road conditions or the proposal will include improvements to mitigate any traffic impacts. 
b.  Guidelines. 
1.  The project should present logical on-site/off-site pedestrian, auto and bike connections. 
2.  The overall project, in terms of site layout, screening and design should demonstrate a compatible relationship to adjacent uses. 
3.  Screening should be provided to mitigate unattractive views such as the rear elevation of buildings, loading areas, outdoor storage areas, outside trash receptacles, building or roof-mounted mechanical equipment, and sources of glare, noise or other potential negative effects of development. Screening should be provided in a manner that screens unsightly views from public rights-of-way, pedestrian paths and adjacent properties. Screening may be achieved through a variety of means including setbacks, planting, fences, walls, site design, architectural design and other such measures. 
(2)  Site layout guidelines. 
a.  The design and arrangement of elements of the site plan should exhibit a favorable relationship with the existing natural topography and natural water bodies and efforts should be made to incorporate existing desirable vegetation. 
b.  The elements of the site plan should be designed to maximize the opportunity of privacy for adjacent land uses, in particular residential land. 
c.  The site layout should consider microclimate conditions and its impact on the safety and convenience of the public. In particular, entryways and pedestrian paths should be located in such a manner as to minimize snow and ice accumulation. 
(3)  Building scale and design. 
a.  Standards. 
1.  Multiple buildings in single projects shall be varied in size and mass. If there is change in building height throughout the site, a transition from low buildings at the site perimeter to larger and taller structures on the interior of the site is required. 
2.  Buildings shall be separated from pavement areas with landscaping and/or walkways. 
3.  Facades shall be articulated to reduce the massive scale and uniform appearance by incorporating horizontal relief projections and recesses at minimum horizontal intervals of 40 feet to provide visual interest, changes in height and relief from long flat walls. Arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings or other such features and changes in color, texture and material should be used to accomplish such purpose. 
b.  Guidelines. 
1.  The building height, mass, scale, orientation and configuration should be compatible with adjacent land uses and provide for harmonious and appropriate transitions where there are differences in character between different land uses. 
2.  A single building complex should be stylistically compatible. Significant patterns or unifying elements such as architectural style, materials, colors and form should work together to express a single theme and to achieve design harmony and continuity. Pad buildings should match materials of main buildings. Structures within the overall development should be similar and have consistent design elements such as roof forms, use of building awnings, facade articulation and repetitive entry design elements. 
3.  All facades of a building that are visible from adjoining properties and/or public streets or paths should be treated with the similar degree of architectural style and detail of the front elevation. 
4.  Roof forms, building height and parapet walls should vary to provide visual interest at building tops. Rooftops should contribute to the visual continuity of each development and should be considered as design elements seen from various viewpoints. Rooflines running in continuous planes should be avoided by offsetting or jogging the roof planes to add visual interest or reducing the scale to break up long, continuous rooflines. Roof forms should be designed to correspond to, and denote building elements and functions such as entrances, arcades, porches, etc. 
5.  The human scale of the site should be promoted through the use of canopies, overhangs, awnings, windows, decorative detailing, lighting, planters, seating areas, street furniture and accessories, signage, water features, landscaping, patterned walkways, public art, bicycle parking, building materials and other elements which will enhance the human scale emphasis of the site. 
6.  Entryways to buildings should be emphasized utilizing architectural elements so that they are visible from the street. This can be achieved in a number of ways including: canopies or porticos, overhangs, recesses/projections, arcades, raised cornice parapets over the doors, peaked roof forms, arches, outdoor patios, display windows, architectural details. 
7.  Exterior materials should be sufficiently durable to ensure stability, maintainability and longevity. 
8.  Colors should be aesthetically pleasing to a reasonable person. Earth tone colors should be compatible with the project built and the natural environment should be used for the dominant color. Primary colors may be used for accent but should not constitute the dominant color of any structure. Reflective materials such as bright aluminum and glass as the primary building material that will generate glare should be avoided. 
(4)  Vehicular circulation; parking; access. 
a.  Standards. 
1.  The circulation/parking/access system shall provide for the safe, orderly, efficient, convenient and functional movement of multiple modes of transportation both on and off the site. Conflicts should be minimized and alternate modes of transportation accommodated by utilizing paving patterns, grade differences, landscaping and lighting. 
2.  The drive aisles shall provide adequate stacking lengths at driveway/street intersections and for internal needs and to prevent impacts to adjacent public rights-of-way. 
3.  Access drives and internal drives shall be coordinated with existing or planned median openings. Curb cuts shall also line up with opposing curb cuts to the extent possible and should be separated a safe distance from intersections and other nearby curb cuts. Convenient and appropriate routes shall be provided for all delivery, emergency and utility service needs. Vehicle circulation within the development shall be designed to provide safe and efficient turning movements for all anticipated service and emergency vehicles. 
b.  Guidelines. 
1.  The internal circulation of projects involving multiple buildings should function as a whole and should include all necessary cross access easements where applicable. To the extent possible, adjoining and proximate projects should provide shared access. 
2.  The proposal should demonstrate that adequate provisions have been made to limit the effects of vehicular noise and exhaust and to minimize paving. 
3.  Parking areas should be designed so that the lots do not visually dominate the site and so that the visual impact on the adjacent properties and from the public right-of-way is minimized. This may be achieved by careful placement of buildings, distribution of parking throughout the site, use of landscaping and topography or other innovative site planning techniques. 
4.  Where possible, the use of low, opaque walls and/or bermed landscaping should be utilized to screen parking from peripheral streets. 
(5)  Open space/landscape considerations; guidelines. 
a.  The project should provide for optimum preservation of natural site features including, without limitation, mature trees, terrain, groundwater and surface water, wetlands, riparian areas and drainage areas and incorporate these areas into the open space plan. 
b.  The open space should be useable and functional and should be coordinated with adjacent open space where practical. 
c.  The landscaping should provide for aesthetic enhancement and should utilize a variety of plants and hard surface materials and vegetation selection should provide for a variety of colors yearround with seasonal variation. 
d.  The use of xeriscaping is encouraged. 
(6)  Ancillary uses; outdoor lighting, signage, fencing. 
a.  Standards. 
1.  Overhead electrical service between street lights along public street frontages shall be placed underground. 
2.  Street lighting is required upon construction of any public street intersections or at existing public street intersections where street lighting is not present. 
3.  Public street lighting shall be installed or replaced according to the standards described in the City of Federal Heights Standards and Specifications. 
4.  Lighting facilities and lighted signs shall be placed and shielded in such a manner, and be of such height and intensity, as not to cause direct light to illuminate other properties and shall not be permitted to create a hazard upon a public street. 
b.  Guidelines. 
1.  The lighting plan should promote energy conservation. 
2.  The lighting plan should contribute to the aesthetic environment by utilizing ornamental armatures and fixtures relating to the architectural theme of the development. 
3.  The signage plan should be of a scale and style appropriate to the development. Signage should be architecturally compatible in color and design with the associated structures and should not detract from the architectural character or aesthetic appeal of the community. 
4.  The size of signs should afford businesses sufficient visibility and identification without becoming a dominant part of the landscape. 
5.  The fencing should be designed to complement the structures on site as demonstrated by material, design and color. 
(7)  Public safety; guidelines. 
a.  The site should have adequate access controls and secure barriers to prevent unauthorized access to the buildings, grounds and restricted areas. The site should have clear territory identity that differentiates private areas from public spaces and discourages trespassing. 
b.  The site layout should be designed to provide natural surveillance that increases the probability of detection for offenders. This would include clear lines of sight to building entrances and parking areas from the street and from inside the building. 
c.  There should be provisions for adequate surveillance devices that protect the business and the public. 
d.  The landscaping should be designed to exclude visual barriers that provide havens for law offenders. 
e.  All vehicular use areas, pedestrian circulation paths and exterior portions of buildings should be provided with adequate security lighting. 
f.  The site should be designed to avoid the creation of blind areas that cannot be patrolled by police or security staff. 
g.  Site drainage should be designed to minimize water collection near building foundations, entrances, pedestrian ramps and service ramps, as well as inadvertent ponding within vehicular parking areas. 
(8)  Resource protection; environmental considerations; guidelines. 
a.  The project should result in minimal cut and fill on the site. The design of the buildings should conform as much as possible to the natural contours of the land, and the site design should minimize erosion, slope instability, landslide, mudflow or subsidence to the subject and adjacent properties. 
b.  Environmentally sensitive areas and significant existing vegetation should be preserved and protected. No structures or landform alteration should be permitted in environmentally sensitive areas unless specific mitigation measures are adopted which will reduce adverse impacts to an acceptable level. 
c.  Stormwater management and site drainage should be designed as visual and recreational amenities, as well as development necessities. 
d.  The buildings should relate to adjacent properties to maintain maximum sun and ventilation, provide protection from prevailing winds, and enhance views of the natural setting by minimizing obstructions.

Sec. 70-900. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, council finds that these regulations are necessary to: 
(1)  Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance, modification, and removal of wireless communication infrastructure in the city with the goal of having the fewest number of wireless communication facilities ("WCF") required to complete a network without unreasonably discriminating against wireless communication providers of functionally equivalent services including all of those who install, maintain, operate, and remove WCFs; 
(2)  Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing the visibility of WCFs to the fullest extent possible through techniques including but not limited to camouflage design techniques and undergrounding of WCFs and the equipment associated therewith; 
(3)  Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive WCFs to supplement existing larger WCFs; 
(4)  Encourage the use of wall mounted panel antennas; 
(5)  Encourage roof mounted antennas only when wall mounted antennas will not provide adequate service or are not otherwise feasible; 
(6)  Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas, in a manner that minimizes the total number of towers needed throughout the community; 
(7)  Encourage strongly the colocation of WCFs on new and existing sites; 
(8)  Encourage owners and users of antennas and towers to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimized; 
(9)  Enhance the ability of wireless communication service providers to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
(10)  Effectively manage WCFs in the right-of-way; and 
(11)  Manage amateur radio facilities and over-the-air receiving devices in the city.

(Ord. No. 16-11, § 1, 11-14-16; Ord. No. 17-11, § 1, 8-15-2017; Ord. No. 18-16, § 2, 11-20-2018) 
Sec. 70-903. - Operational standards. 
(a)  Federal requirements. All WCFs shall meet the current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Authority ("FAA"), the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate WCFs. If such standards and regulations are amended, then the owners of the WCF governed by this article shall bring such facility into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to meet such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense. 
(b)  Permission to use within rights-of-way or upon public property. For WCFs in the right-of-way, the applicant shall execute a master license agreement with the city, granting applicant a non-exclusive license to use the right-of-way. Applicants shall also, as applicable execute supplemental licenses with the city for each facility subject to the master license agreement. An annual attachment fee shall be required for each supplemental site license involving the attachment of WCF's to any city owned structure in the right-of-way. Master licenses and supplemental site licenses are subject to administrative processing fees and such fees along with the attachment fee shall be established by resolution of city council. Attachment of WCFs on an existing traffic signal, street light pole, or similar structure shall require written evidence of a license, or other legal right or approval, to use such structure by its owner. Prior to, or concurrently with, seeking land use approval for a WCF on public property, the applicant shall execute a lease agreement with the city. 
(c)  Signal interference. All WCFs shall be designed and sited, consistent with applicable federal regulations, so as not to cause interference with the normal operation of radio, television, telephone and other communication services utilized by adjacent residential and non-residential properties; nor shall any such facilities interfere with any public safety communications. The applicant shall provide a written statement from a qualified radio frequency engineer, certifying that a technical evaluation of existing and proposed facilities indicates no potential interference problems and shall allow the city to monitor interference levels with public safety communications during this process. Additionally, the applicant shall notify the city at least ten calendar days prior to the introduction of new service or changes in existing service, and shall allow the city to monitor interference levels with public safety communications during the testing process. 
(d)  Legal access. In all applications for WCFs an applicant must warrant and represent that it has the written agreement of the owner of the property which is the subject of the application for legal access to and from the WCF and the applicant must also warrant and represent that it will have legal access to the utilities to operate and maintain the WCF. 
(e)  Operation and maintenance. To ensure the structural integrity of WCFs, the owner of a WCF shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building and safety codes. If upon inspection, the city concludes that a WCF fails to comply with such codes and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon written notice being provided to the owner of the WCF, the owner shall have 30 days from the date of notice to bring such WCF into compliance. Upon good cause shown by the owner, the city's building official may extend such compliance period not to exceed 90 days from the date of said notice. If the owner fails to bring such WCF into compliance within said time period, the city may remove such WCF at the owner's expense. 
(f)  Abandonment and removal. If a WCF has not been in use for a period of three months, the owner of the WCF shall notify the city of the non-use and shall indicate whether re-use is expected within the ensuing three months. Any WCF that is not operated for a continuous period of six months shall be considered abandoned. The city, in its sole discretion, may require an abandoned WCF to be removed. The owner of such WCF shall remove the same within 30 days of receipt of written notice from the city. If the WCF is not removed within said 30 days, the city may remove it at the owner's expense and any approved permits for the WCF shall be deemed to have expired. Additionally, the city, in its sole discretion, shall not approve any new WCF application until the applicant, if also an owner or operator of an abandoned WCF, has removed such WCF or payment for such removal has been made to the city. 
(Ord. No. 16-11, § 1, 11-14-16; Ord. No. 17-11, § 1, 8-15-2017; Ord. No. 18-16, §§ 3, 4, 11-20-2018) 
Sec. 70-904. - Design standards. 
(a)  The requirements set forth in this section shall apply to the location and design of all WCFs governed by this section; provided, however, that the city may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this section are better served thereby. To that end, WCFs shall be designed and located to minimize the impact on the surrounding neighborhood and to maintain the character and appearance of the city, consistent with other provisions of the Code. 
(1)  Camouflage/concealment. All WCFs and any transmission equipment shall, to the extent possible, use camouflage design techniques including, but not limited to the use of materials, colors, textures, screening, undergrounding, landscaping, or other design options that will blend the WCF to the surrounding natural setting and built environment. Design, materials and colors of WCFs shall be compatible with the surrounding environment. Designs shall be compatible with structures and vegetation on the same parcel and adjacent parcels. 
a.  Camouflage design may be of heightened importance where findings of particular sensitivity are made (e.g. proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views, and/or community features). In such instances where WCFs are located in areas of high visibility, they shall (where possible) be designed (e.g., placed underground, depressed, or located behind earth berms) to minimize their profile. 
b.  The camouflage design may include the use of alternative tower structures should the director determine that such design meets the intent of the Code and the community is better served thereby. 
c.  All WCFs, such as antennas, vaults, equipment rooms, equipment enclosures, and tower structures shall be constructed out of non-reflective materials (visible exterior surfaces only). 
(2)  Hazardous materials. No hazardous materials shall be permitted in association with WCFs, except those necessary for the operations of the WCF and only in accordance with all applicable laws governing such materials. 
(3)  Colocation. WCFs shall be designed and constructed to permit the facility to accommodate WCFs from at least two wireless service providers on the same WCF unless the city approves an alternative design to the extent such design is reasonably feasible based upon construction, engineering and design standards. No WCF owner or operator shall unreasonably exclude a telecommunications competitor from using the same facility or location. Upon request by the city, the owner or operator shall provide evidence demonstrating why colocation is not possible at a particular facility or site. 
(4)  Siting. 
a.  No portion of any WCF may extend beyond the property line of the lot upon which it is located. 
b.  Colocation. WCFs may be required to be designed and constructed to permit the facility to accommodate WCFs from at least two wireless service providers on the same WCF unless the city approves an alternative design. No WCF owner or operator shall unfairly exclude a competitor from using the same facility or location. 
c.  WCFs shall be sited in a location that does not reduce the parking for the other principal uses on the parcel below Code standards. 
(5)  Lighting. WCFs shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable governmental authority, or the WCF is mounted on a light pole or other similar structure primarily used for lighting purposes. If lighting is required, the city may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. Lighting shall be shielded or directed to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the amount of glare and light falling onto nearby properties, particularly residences. 
(6)  Landscaping and fencing requirements. 
a.  WCFs shall be sited in a manner that does not reduce the landscaped areas for the other principal uses on the parcel, below Code standards. 
b.  WCFs shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the WCF from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of the front, side, and rear landscaped setback on the perimeter of the site. 
c.  In locations where the visual impact of the WCF would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the director. 
d.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as WCFs sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the site perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. 
e.  No trees larger than four inches in diameter measured at four and one-half feet high on the tree may be removed, unless authorized by the director. To obtain such authorization the applicant shall show that tree removal is necessary, the applicant's plan minimizes the number of trees to be removed and any trees removed are replaced at a ratio of two to one. 
(7)  Noise. Noise generated on the site must not exceed the standards in the Code, except that a WCF owner or operator shall be permitted to exceed Code noise standards for a reasonable period of time during repairs, not to exceed two hours without prior authorization from the city. 
(8)  Adjacent to single-family residential uses. WCFs shall be sited in a manner that considers the proximity of the facility to residential structures and residential district boundaries. When placed by residential property, the WCF shall be placed adjacent to the common side yard property line between adjoining residential properties, such that the WCF minimizes visual impacts equitably among adjacent properties. In the case of a corner lot, the WCF may be placed adjacent to the common side yard property line between adjoining residential properties, or on the corner formed by two intersecting streets. If these requirements are not reasonably feasible from a construction, engineering or design perspective, the applicant may submit a written statement to the director requesting the WCF be exempt from these requirements. 
(9)  Additional design requirements shall be applicable to the various types of WCFs as specified below: 
a.  Base stations. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, or alternative tower structure, such as a base station (including, but not limited to the antennas and accessory equipment) it shall be of a neutral, non-reflective color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure, or uses other camouflage/concealment design techniques so as to make the antenna and related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible, including for example, without limitation, painting the antennas and accessory equipment to match the structure. Additionally, any ground-mounted equipment shall be located, based upon the reasonable discretion of the city, in a manner necessary to address both public safety and aesthetic concerns and may, where appropriate, require a flush-to-grade underground equipment vault. 
b.  Alternative tower structures and small cell facilities. 
1.  Shall be designed and constructed to look like a building, facility, or structure typically found in the area; 
2.  Be camouflaged/concealed consistent with other existing natural or manmade features in the immediate proximity of the location where the alternative tower structure will be located. 
3.  Height or size of the proposed alternative tower structure or small cell facility should be minimized as much as possible and shall be subject to the maximum height restrictions of the zoning district in which they are located, subject to a maximum height limit of 60 feet; 
4.  Shall be sited in a manner that is least obtrusive to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
5.  Shall take into consideration the uses on adjacent and nearby properties and the compatibility of the facility to these uses; 
6.  Shall be compatible with the surrounding topography, tree coverage, and foliage; 
7.  Shall be designed utilizing design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and 
8.  Visual impacts of the proposed ingress and egress shall be minimized. 
c.  Alternative tower structures and small cell facilities located in the right-of-way, requirements in addition to those set forth here in this subsection. 
1.  Shall be no higher than 35 feet. 
2.  Shall be no more than ten feet higher (as measured from the ground to the top of the pole) than any existing utility or traffic signal within 500 feet of the pole or structure. 
3.  Any new pole for an alternative tower structure or small cell facility shall be separated from any other existing WCF facility by a distance of a least 600 feet, unless the new pole replaces an existing traffic signal, street light pole, or similar structure determined by the director. 
4.  Pole-mounted components shall be located on an existing utility pole serving another utility; or be located on a new utility pole where other utility distribution lines are aerial, if there are no reasonable alternatives. 
5.  Shall be camouflaged/concealed consistent with other existing natural or manmade features in the right-of-way near the location where the alternative tower structure will be located. 
6.  Shall to the extent feasible, be consistent with the size and shape of pole-mounted equipment installed by communications companies on utility poles near the alternative tower structure. 
7.  Shall when located near a residential property, be placed in front of the common side yard property line between adjoining residential properties. In the case of a corner lot, the facility must be placed in front of the common side yard property line adjoining residential properties, or on the corner formed by two intersecting streets. 
8.  Shall be designed such that antenna installations on traffic signals are placed in a manner so that the size, appearance, and function of the signal will not be considerably altered. 
9.  Facility antennas, mast arms, equipment, and other facilities shall be sized to minimize visual clutter. 
10.  Any ground mounted equipment shall be installed in an underground or partially underground equipment vault (projecting not more than 36 inches above grade), or co-located within a traffic cabinet of a design approved by the director. 
11.  Shall not alter vehicular circulation or parking within the right-of-way or impede vehicular, bicycle, or pedestrian access or visibility along the right-of-way. Must comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and all applicable local, state, and federal law and regulations. No alternative tower structure nor small cell facility may be located or maintained in a manner that causes unreasonable interference. Unreasonable interference means any use of the right-of-way that disrupts or interferes with this use by the city, the general public, or other person authorized to use or be present upon the right-of-way, when there exists an alternative that would result in less disruption or interference. Unreasonable interference includes any use of the right-of-way that disrupts vehicular or pedestrian traffic, any interference with public utilities, and any other activity that will present a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare. 
d.  Towers. 
1.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, or, subject to any applicable FAA standards, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness as determined by the city; 
2.  Tower structures should use existing land forms, vegetation, and structures to aid in screening the facility from view or blending in with the surrounding built and natural environment; 
3.  Monopole support structures shall taper from the base to the tip; 
4.  All towers, excluding alternative tower structures in right-of-way, shall be enclosed by security fencing or wall at least six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. No security fencing or any portion thereof shall consist of barbed wire or chain link material; 
5.  Towers shall be subject to the maximum height restrictions of the zoning district in which they are located, subject to a maximum height limit of 60 feet; 
6.  Towers should be sited in a manner that is least obtrusive to residential structures and residential district boundaries where feasible; 
7.  Towers should take into consideration the uses on adjacent and nearby properties and the compatibility of the tower to these uses; 
8.  Towers should be designed utilizing design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
9.  Visual impacts of the proposed ingress and egress shall be minimized; 
10.  No new towers shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no existing WCFs can accommodate the needs that the applicant proposes to address with its tower application. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing WCF can accommodate these needs may consist of the following: 
i.  No existing WCFs are of sufficient height and are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
ii.  Existing WCFs do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed WCF; and 
iii.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing WCFs unsuitable for colocation. 
11.  A tower, located outside of the right-of-way, shall meet the greater of the following minimum setbacks from all property lines: 
i.  The setback for a principal building within the applicable zoning; 
ii.  Twenty-five percent of the facility height, including WCFs and transmission equipment; or 
iii.  The tower height, including antennas, if the tower is in or adjacent to a residential district or residential zoned property. 
iv.  Towers over 40 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter mile from any existing tower that is over 40 feet in height, unless the applicant has shown to the satisfaction of the city that there are no reasonably suitable alternative sites in the required geographic area which can meet the applicant's needs.

(Ord. No. 16-11, § 1, 11-14-16; Ord. No. 17-11, § 1, 8-15-2017; Ord. No. 18-16, § 5, 11-20-2018) 
Sec. 70-905. - Review procedures and requirements. 
(a)  No new WCF shall be constructed and no colocation or modification to any WCF may occur except after a written request from an applicant, reviewed and approved by the city in accordance with this article. All WCFs shall be reviewed pursuant to the following procedures: 
(1)  Submittal requirements. In addition to an application form, signal interference letter, removal affidavits, and payment of all application and review fees, as established by resolution of city council, each applicant shall submit a scaled site plan, photo simulation, scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation showing the location and dimension of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, drainage, and other information deemed by the director to be necessary to assess compliance with this section. Documents requiring signatures and seals by appropriate qualified professionals shall be provided by applicant after approval of the application by the director. 
(2)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for a WCF shall provide to the director a narrative and map description of the applicant's existing or then currently proposed WCFs within the city, and outside of the city within one mile of its boundaries. In addition, the applicant shall inform the city generally of the areas of the city in which it believes WCFs may need to be located within the next three years. The inventory list should identify the site name, site address, and a general description of the facility (for example, rooftop antennas and ground mounted equipment). This provision is not intended to be a requirement that the applicant submit its business plan, proprietary information, or make commitments regarding locations of WCFs within the city. Rather, it is an attempt to provide a mechanism for the city and all applicants for WCFs to share general information, assist in the city's comprehensive planning process, and promote colocation by identifying areas in which WCFs might be appropriately constructed for multiple users. 
The city may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional permits under this section or other organizations seeking to locate WCFs within the jurisdiction of the city, provided however, that the city is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(3)  Abandonment and removal. Prior to approval, affidavits shall be required from the owner of the property and from the applicant acknowledging that each is responsible for the removal of a WCF that is abandoned or is unused for a period of six months. 
(4)  In all zoning districts, applications for base stations, alternative tower structures, and towers may be permitted only as a conditional use in accordance with the requirements of this article. All applications for towers shall demonstrate that other alternative design options such as base stations or alternative tower structures are not viable options as determined by the city. Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, no towers located in the right-of-way shall exceed 35 feet in height. 
(5)  Applications for base stations, alternative tower structures and small cell facilities within right-of-way. In all zoning districts each application for a base station, alternative tower structure or small cell facility within the right-of-way shall be reviewed and considered for approval by the director for conformance with this article and the applicant's execution of a license agreement as approved by the director. Applicants may appeal the director's decision by submitting a written notice of appeal to the city manager within ten calendar days from the date of the director's decision. The notice of appeal must specifically set forth the grounds for appeal and include all documentation the applicant deems relevant. The city manager shall within ten business days of receipt of the notice of appeal and review of all documentation submitted by the applicant and the director's decision issue a final decision which may affirm, overturn or modify the director's decision. 
Except for WCFs in the right-of-way that meet all requirements of this article, the director may refer the application to planning and zoning commission for conditional use review if the director finds the proposed WCF to have a significant visual impact (e.g., proximity to historic or designated view corridors, or on significant community features), or otherwise is substantially incompatible with the structure on which the WCF will be installed, or it does not meet the clear intent of this article. 
(6)  Review procedures for eligible facilities requests. 
a.  Application. In all zoning districts, eligible facilities requests shall be considered a use by right subject to administrative review. The city shall prepare, and make publicly available, an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for the city to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities request. Such information may include, without limitation, whether the request: 
1.  Would result in a substantial change; 
2.  Violate a generally applicable law, regulations, or other rule codifying objective standards reasonably related to public health and safety. 
The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification or colocation. 
b.  Type of review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request pursuant to this section, the director shall review such application to determine whether the application so qualifies. 
c.  Timeframe for review. Subject to the tolling provisions of subparagraph d. below, within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this section, the city shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this subsection. 
d.  Tolling of the timeframe for review. The 60-day review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement of the city and the applicant, or in cases where the director determines that the application is incomplete: 
1.  To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the city must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application; 
2.  The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental written submission in response to the city's notice of incompleteness; and 
3.  Following a supplemental submission, the city will notify the applicant within ten days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraph (d)(1). In the case of a second or subsequent notice of incompleteness, the city may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness. 
e.  Failure to act. In the event the city fails to act on a request seeking approval for an eligible facilities request under this section within the timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant becomes effective when the applicant notifies the city in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. 
f.  Interaction with Telecommunications Act Section 332(c)(7). If the city determines that the applicant's request is not an eligible facilities request as set forth in this article the presumptively reasonable timeframe under Section 332(c)(7), as prescribed by the FCC's Shot Clock order, will begin to run from the issuance of the city's decision that the application is not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, the city may request additional information from the applicant to evaluate the application under Section 332(c)(7) reviews. 
(7)  Decision. Any decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a WCF, shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. The applicant shall receive a copy of the decision. 
(8)  Compliance with applicable law. Notwithstanding the approval of an application for colocation as described herein, all work done pursuant to WCF applications must be completed in accordance with all applicable building and safety requirements as set forth in the Code and any other applicable federal, state, and/or local laws and regulations. In addition, all WCF applications shall comply with the following: 
a.  Comply with any permit or license issued by a local, state, or federal agency with jurisdiction of the WCF; 
b.  Comply with easements, covenants, conditions and/or restrictions on or applicable to the underlying real property; 
c.  Be maintained in good working condition and to the standards established at the time of application approval; and 
d.  Remain free from trash, debris, litter, noxious weeds, graffiti, and other forms of vandalism. Any damage shall be repaired as soon as practicable, and in no instance more than ten calendar days from the time of notification by the city or after discovery by the owner or operator of the site. 
(9)  Compliance report. Upon request by the city, the applicant shall provide a compliance report within 45 days after installation of a WCF, demonstrating that as installed and in operation, the WCF complies with all conditions of approval, all applicable Code requirements and standard regulations. 
(Ord. No. 16-11, § 1, 11-14-16; Ord. No. 17-11, § 1, 8-15-2017; Ord. No. 18-16, § 6, 11-20-2018) 
Sec. 70-906. - Conditional use standards for approval. 
(a)  In addition to the design standards set forth in this article, conditional use approval for WCFs, shall be evaluated for approval, in accordance with the procedure governing conditional uses as set forth in article x of chapter 70 of the Code, subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Base stations. 
a.  Such facilities shall be architecturally compatible with respect to attachments, and colored to match the building or structure to which they are attached; 
b.  The maximum protrusion of such facilities from the building or structure face to which they are attached shall be six feet; 
c.  Wall mounted WCFs shall not extend above the roofline unless mounted to a penthouse; and 
d.  Roof mounted WCFs shall be approved only where an applicant demonstrates a wall mounted WCF is inadequate to provide service and evaluated for approval based upon the following criteria: 
1.  Roof mounted whip antennas shall extend no more than 12 feet above the parapet of any flat roof or ridge of a sloped roof or penthouse to which they are attached; 
2.  Roof mounted panel antennas shall extend no more than seven feet above the parapet of a flat roof or ridge of a sloped roof to which they are mounted; and 
3.  Other roof mounted transmission equipment shall extend no more than seven feet above any parapet of a flat roof upon which they may be placed, and shall not be permitted on a sloped roof. 
(2)  Alternative tower structures. 
a.  Such structures shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding area; 
b.  Height or size of the proposed alternative tower structure should be minimized as much as practically possible; 
c.  WCFs shall be sited in a manner that evaluates the proximity of the facility to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
d.  WCFs shall take into consideration the uses on adjacent and nearby properties and the compatibility of the facility to these uses; 
e.  Compatibility with the surrounding topography; 
f.  Compatibility with the surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
g.  Compatibility of the design of the site, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and 
h.  Impact on the surrounding area of the proposed ingress and egress, if any. 
(3)  All other towers. The city shall within the framework of the review criteria set forth in this article consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use approval, although the city may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the city concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
a.  Height or size of the proposed tower; 
b.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
c.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
d.  Compatibility with the surrounding topography; 
e.  Compatibility with the surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
f.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
g.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
h.  No new towers shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no existing WCFs can accommodate the needs that the applicant proposes to address with its tower application. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing WCF can accommodate these needs may consist of the following: 
1.  No existing WCFs with a suitable height are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
2.  Existing WCFs do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed WCF; and 
3.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing WCFs unsuitable for colocation. 
(4)  Setbacks and separation. The following minimum setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all WCFs for which a special use approval is required; provided, however, that the city may reduce standard setbacks and separation requirements if the applicant demonstrates that the goals of this section can be better met by reduced setback and separation requirements that protect the public health and safety, view corridors, or minimize adverse impact. A tower shall meet the greater of the following minimum setbacks from all property lines: 
a.  The setback for a principal building within the applicable zoning district; 
b.  Twenty-five percent of the facility height, including WCFs and related accessory equipment; 
c.  The tower height, including antennas, if the tower is in or adjacent to a residential district; and 
d.  Towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter mile from any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height, unless the applicant has shown to the satisfaction of the city that there are no reasonably suitable alternative sites in the required geographic area which can meet the applicant's needs.
