PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Garden City, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1968 Code, as supplemented through April 12, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1968 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Sec. 1-6. - Supplementation of Code-Generally. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the governing body. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings, and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement and make changes in such catchlines, headings, and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Same-Exclusion of special or temporary ordinances. 
    Ordinances hereafter adopted which are not of a general or permanent nature shall be numbered consecutively, authenticated, published, and recorded in the book of ordinances, but such ordinances shall not be prepared for insertion in this Code, nor be deemed a part hereof. 
Sec. 1-8. - Penalty for violations. 
(a)  In this Code, "violation of this Code" means: 
(1)  Doing an act that is prohibited or made or declared unlawful, a violation, an offense, or a misdemeanor as provided by ordinance or by rule or regulation; 
(2)  Failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance; or 
(3)  Failure to perform an act if the failure is declared a misdemeanor, a violation, or an offense or unlawful by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance. 
(b)  In this Code, "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a city officer or city employee to perform an official duty unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section. 
(c)  For the purpose of sentencing, unless otherwise specified in this Code, the following classes of violations of this Code and the punishment and terms of confinement authorized for each class are established: 
(1)  Class A, the sentence for which shall be a definite term of confinement in the county jail which shall be fixed by the court and shall not exceed one year; 
(2)  Class B, the sentence for which shall be a definite term of confinement in the county jail which shall be fixed by the court and shall not exceed six months; 
(3)  Class C, the sentence for which shall be a definite term of confinement in the county jail which shall be fixed by the court and shall not exceed one month; 
(4)  Unclassified violations, which shall include all offenses declared to be violations without specification as to class, the sentence for which shall be in accordance with the sentence specified in the section that defines the offense; if no penalty is provided, the sentence shall be the same penalty as provided herein for a class C violation. 
(d)  In addition to or in lieu of any other sentence authorized, whenever there is evidence that the act constituting the violation was substantially related to the possession, use or ingestion of cereal malt beverage or alcoholic liquor by such person, the court may order such person to attend and satisfactorily complete an alcohol or drug education or training program certified by the administrative judge of the 25th judicial district of the state or licensed by the State Secretary of Social and Rehabilitation Services. 
(e)  A person convicted of a violation of this Code may, in addition to, or instead of, the confinement authorized by law, be sentenced to pay a fine which shall be fixed by the court, unless otherwise specified in this Code, as follows: 
(1)  Class A violation, a sum not exceeding $2,500.00. 
(2)  Class B violation, a sum not exceeding $1,000.00. 
(3)  Class C violation, a sum not exceeding $500.00. 
(4)  Unclassified violation, any sum authorized by the section that defines the offense. If no penalty is provided in such law, the fine shall not exceed the fine provided herein for a class C violation. 
(f)  The judge of the municipal court may grant probation or suspended sentence upon a conviction for violation of this Code. As a condition of probation or suspended sentence, the judge of the municipal court shall assess a probation fee of $25.00. In addition, the judge of the municipal court shall have the authority to order a person to reimburse the city for all or part of the expenditures by the city to provide counsel or other defense services to the person. In determining the amount or method of payment of such sum, the judge of the municipal court shall take account of the financial resources of the person and the nature of the burden payment of such sum will impose. A person who has been required to pay such sum and who is not willfully in default in the payment thereof, may at any time, petition the court to waive payment of such sum or any unpaid portion thereof. If it appears to the satisfaction of the judge of the municipal court that the payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the person or the person's immediate family, the judge of the municipal court may waive payment of all or part of the amount due or modify the method of payment.

(b)  The TNR program shall be carried out in the following manner: 
(1)  The humane society shall recruit caregivers in selected portions of the city who are willing to provide assistance on the caregiver's property to provide food and care for feral cats, to assist the humane society in humanely trapping cats on the caregiver's property for the purposes of the TNR program, and to permit the humane society to release feral cats back onto the caregiver's property. City Code of Ordinances (City Code), section 10-76, shall not be applicable to the number of feral cats on the caregiver's property. 
(2)  The caregivers must agree in writing, as a condition of participation in the TNR program, to abide by all of the requirements and regulations of the TNR program as approved by this ordinance, and to follow the direction of the humane society as to best practices so as to minimize as much as reasonably possible the creation or maintenance of any nuisance or unsanitary conditions, and to minimize impacts upon nearby property owners and residents. Under no circumstances may a caregiver maintain its property in a manner that creates a nuisance, unsanitary conditions, or interferes with the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. The humane society shall have the complete right and discretion in the selection of caregivers into the TNR program and in the discharge or discontinuance of any caregiver from the TNR program; provided, however, that the humane society shall not utilize any caregiver who is or has become disqualified from participation by virtue of the provisions of subsections (b)(8)c. and d. below. 
(3)  Before being released, captured feral cats shall be medically evaluated and treated, sterilized, vaccinated and ear-tipped. Previously captured and released feral cats which have been re-captured may be immediately released unless they are in need of medical care or need to be re-vaccinated. The humane society shall have complete discretion to make the following decisions as an alternative to the release of a captured feral cat: 
a.  To euthanize or otherwise humanely dispose of a feral cat deemed too ill or injured, or deemed to be too dangerous to be released; or 
b.  To retain for adoption a feral cat deemed appropriately domesticated or capable of domestication. 
(4)  If a GCPD law enforcement officer in the exercise of his or her lawful authority determines that a cat in the possession of a caregiver or the humane society should be impounded as provided under the City Code, then the further handling of such cat shall be subject to the lawful orders and directions issued pursuant to City Code. 
(5)  Should it be determined by the humane society that a captured cat is a domesticated cat owned by an identifiable person, the humane society may return the cat to its owner; provided, however, the humane society shall report the same, including the name and address of the owner(s), to the GCPD's animal control officer. 
(6)  The humane society shall create and maintain a registry of all feral cats which have been captured and then released, which registry shall include a photograph of the feral cat and other identifying information, the date and place of capture, the date of sterilization and vaccination, the date and place of release, and such other information as the humane society deems appropriate and useful for the program. Such registry shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by the GCPD. 
(7)  The humane society shall maintain a registry of the name, current address and other contact information of each caregiver participating in the TNR program, which registry shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by the GCPD. The humane society shall give prompt notification to the GCPD of each person who is added to the caregiver registry, and shall likewise give prompt notification of the removal of any person from such registry.

b.  Is removed by the humane society from the TNR program for such reasons as the humane society deems appropriate;

d.  Is disqualified from participation in the TNR program due to the conviction of such person in the city municipal court for a violation of chapter 10 of the City Code. 
(9)  The humane society shall be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the TNR program. 
(10)  The humane society shall prepare such reports to the city governing body as may be requested from time to time to enable the governing body to evaluate the effectiveness of the TNR program.

Such return shall be accomplished within 45 days of the receipt of the moneys from the insurance company or companies.

A stop work order may also be issued. 
(7)  All contractors working on a site subject to an industrial general permit or the construction general permit shall sign a copy of the following certification statement prescribed in the Erosion and Sediment Control Manual before beginning work on the site. 
(8)  All contractors will be responsible for their own activities to ensure that they comply with the owners' SWPPP. Failure to comply with the SWPPP or malicious destruction of BMP devices is hereby deemed a violation of this chapter. 
(9)  The SWPPP and the certifications of contractors required by subsection (b)(7) of this section, and with any modifications attached, shall be retained at the construction site from the date of construction commencement through the date of final stabilization. 
(10)  City officer may notify the owner at any time that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of the NPDES permit issued or any additional requirement imposed by or under this chapter. Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or these chapters, which are not being met by the SWPPP, and identify which provisions of the SWPPP, require modification in order to meet such requirements. Within 30 days of such notification from the city, the owner shall make the required changes to the SWPPP and shall submit to the city officer a written certification from the owner that the requested changes have been made. 
(11)  The owner shall amend the SWPPP whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the storm sewer system or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWPPP, or if the SWPPP proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges. 
(12)  Qualified personnel (provided by the owner of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of the storm that is one-half inch or greater. Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWPPP shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the storm sewer system. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
(13)  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (b)(12) of this section, the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWPPP shall be revised as appropriate. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWPPP within seven calendar days following the inspection.

ARTICLE VII. - POST-CONSTRUCTION 

Sec. 38-190. - Adoption of post-construction stormwater guidelines and specifications; incorporated by reference. 
    The standard guidelines and specifications for post-construction best management practices on construction site activities, as contained in the Post-Construction Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, City of Garden City, 2009, (Post-Construction Stormwater Manual) prepared by the city are adopted, and incorporated by reference. 
(Ord. No. 2456-2009, § 1, 8-18-09) 
Sec. 38-191. - General provisions. 
(a)  Findings of fact. Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-born pollutants, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
    Therefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, river bank erosion; 
(2)  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
(3)  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; 
(4)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. 
(c)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or a waiver in accordance with section 38-194. The article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
    To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the city has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one acre or more of land. The following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria: 
(1)  Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan. 
(2)  Repairs to any stormwater management practice deemed necessary by the stormwater coordinator/inspector. 
    When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the post-construction stormwater manual. This criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the planning and development director. 
(d)  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(e)  Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article.

(Ord. No. 2456-2009, § 1, 8-18-09) 
Sec. 38-194. - Waivers to stormwater management requirements. 
(a)  Waivers for providing stormwater management. Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this article, unless a waiver to the regulations is approved in accordance with the following procedure. Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the planning commission for consideration and approval by the governing body. 
    The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies: 
(1)  It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article. 
(2)  Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the city engineer and the implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance. 
(3)  Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
(4)  The city engineer finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
(5)  Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduces: a) the generation of stormwater from the site, b) the size and cost of stormwater storage and c) the pollutants generated at the site. These nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the post-construction stormwater manual, and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the city engineer. 
    In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the governing body may grant a waiver from these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
(1)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
(2)  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
(3)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and/or property. 
    Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the city. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; 
(2)  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article. 
(b)  Dedication of land. An applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the governing body for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the governing body prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the building permit.

Sec. 38-195. - General performance criteria for stormwater management. 
    The following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites, unless a waiver has been granted as provided by the governing body: 
(1)  All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
(2)  All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge stormwater directly into a jurisdictional body of water without adequate stormwater management practices. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the city engineer. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) or the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) responsible for natural resources. 
(3)  Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained, by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods. At a minimum, annual recharge from the post-development site shall mimic the annual recharge from pre-development site conditions. 
(4)  For new development, structural stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove 85 percent of the average annual post-development total suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a SMP complies with this performance standard if it is: 
A.  Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQv), 
B.  Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in the Post-Construction Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, City of Garden City, 2009, 
C.  Constructed properly, and 
D.  Maintained regularly. 
(5)  To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the post-construction stormwater manual. 
(6)  Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources may be subject to additional performance criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. 
(7)  Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites. 
(8)  Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as hot spots, may require the use of specific structural SMPs and pollution prevention practices. 
(9)  Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the city engineer to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. 
(10)  The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the post-construction stormwater manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices. 
(Ord. No. 2456-2009, § 1, 8-18-09) 
Sec. 38-196. - Basic stormwater management design criteria. 
(a)  Minimum control requirements. All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes as identified in the post-construction stormwater manual are met, unless the governing body grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city engineer reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 
(b)  Site design feasibility. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be considered: 
(1)  Topography. 
(2)  Maximum drainage area. 
(3)  Depth to the water table. 
(4)  Soils. 
(5)  Slopes. 
(6)  Terrain. 
    Applicants shall consult the post-construction stormwater manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a stormwater management practice. 
(c)  Conveyance issues. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points. 
(2)  Protection of inlet and outfall structures. 
(3)  Elimination of erosive flow velocities. 
(4)  Providing of under-drain systems, where applicable. 
    The post-construction stormwater manual shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater management practices. 
(d)  Geometry conditions. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to capture and manage stormwater runoff according to the specifications outlined in the post-construction stormwater manual. These specifications designate the water quantity and quality criteria that apply to an approved stormwater management practice. 
(e)  Landscaping plans required. All stormwater management practices must have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. 
(f)  Maintenance agreements. All stormwater management practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the stormwater management practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater management practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance activities. 
(g)  Nonstructural stormwater practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater management practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned through the use of nonstructural practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site. These nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the post-construction stormwater manual and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners. 
(Ord. No. 2456-2009, § 1, 8-18-09) 
Sec. 38-197. - Requirements for stormwater management plan approval. 
(a)  Stormwater management plan required for all developments. No application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be prepared by an individual approved by the city and must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site and, if on-site, the general location and type of practices. The stormwater management plan(s) shall be referred for comment to all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater management plan. This final plan must be signed by a licensed professional engineer (PE), who will verify that the design of all stormwater management practices meet the submittal requirements outlined in the submittal checklist found in the post-construction stormwater manual. No building, grading, or sediment control permit shall be issued until a satisfactory final stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the governing body after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Stormwater management concept plan requirements. A stormwater management concept plan shall be required with all permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this conceptual planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the following information shall be included in the concept plan: 
(1)  A map (or maps) indicating the location of existing and proposed buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, structural stormwater management and sediment control facilities. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities, roads and easements; the limits of clearing and grading; a written description of the site plan and justification of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required. 
(2)  Sufficient engineering analysis to show that the proposed stormwater management practices are capable of controlling runoff from the site in compliance with this article and the specifications of the post-construction stormwater manual. 
(3)  A written or graphic inventory of the natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project site. This description should include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover, topography, wetlands, and other native vegetative areas on the site. Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for development. 
(4)  A written description of the required maintenance burden for any proposed stormwater management facility. 
(5)  The planning and development director may also require a concept plan to consider the maximum development potential of a site under existing zoning, regardless of whether the applicant presently intends to develop the site to its maximum potential. 
    For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously developed site, an applicant shall be required to include within the stormwater concept plan measures for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges from the site in accordance with the standards of this ordinance to the maximum extent practicable. 
(c)  Final stormwater management plan requirements. After review of the stormwater management concept plan, and modifications to that plan as deemed necessary by the city engineer, a final stormwater management plan must be submitted for approval. The final stormwater management plan, in addition to the information from the concept plan, shall include all of the information required in the final stormwater management plan checklist found in the post-construction stormwater manual. This includes: 
(1)  Contact information: The name, address, and the telephone number of all persons having a legal interest in the property and the tax reference number and parcel number of the property or properties affected. 
(2)  Topographic base map: A 1" = 200' topographic base map of the site which extends a minimum of 500 feet beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicates existing surface water drainage including ponds, culverts, and ditches; current land use including all existing structures; locations of utilities, roads, and easements; and significant natural and manmade features not otherwise shown. 
(3)  Calculations: Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the pre-development and post-development conditions for the design storms in the post-construction stormwater manual. 
(4)  Soils information: If the stormwater management control measure depends on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles. The number and location of required soil borings or soil sits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the control measure. 
(5)  Maintenance and repair plan: The design and planning of all stormwater management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued function. These plans will identify the parts or components of a stormwater management facility that need to be maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary. Provisions for the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan. 
(6)  Landscaping plan: The applicant must present a detailed plan for management of vegetation at the site after construction is finished, including who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. 
(7)  Maintenance easements: The applicant must ensure access to all stormwater treatment practices at the site for the purpose of inspection and repair by securing all the maintenance easements needed on a permanent basis. These easements will be recorded with the plan and will remain in effect even with transfer of title to the property. 
(8)  Maintenance agreement: The applicant must execute an easement and an inspection and maintenance agreement binding on all subsequent owners of land served by an on-site stormwater management measure in accordance with the specifications of this article. 
(9)  Erosions and sediment control plans for construction of stormwater management practices: The applicant must prepare an erosion and sediment control plan for all construction activities related to implementing any on-site stormwater management practices. 
(10)  Other environmental permits: the applicant shall assure that all other applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site prior to approval of the final stormwater design plan. 
(d)  Security. The applicant shall provide a maintenance bond, or other acceptable security in an amount approved by the city engineer and city attorney to be in force for a minimum period of one year, after completion and acceptance of such work or improvements by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2456-2009, § 1, 8-18-09) 
Sec. 38-198. - Construction inspection. 
(a)  Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the stormwater coordinator in advance before the commencement of construction. Regular inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the responsible professional engineer or their designee. All inspections shall be documented and written reports prepared that contain the following information: 
(1)  The date and location of the inspection; 
(2)  Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan; 
(3)  Variations from the approved construction specifications; 
(4)  Any violations that exist. 
If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until all violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by the stormwater coordinator. 
(b)  As built plans. All applicants are required to submit actual as built plans for any stormwater management practices located on-site after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the stormwater coordinator is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. 
(c)  Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. 
    Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over 75 percent of the seeded area. Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of minimum of 75 percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75 percent survival for one year is achieved. 
    In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or by the soil conservation district, and must be approved prior to receiving a permit. 
(Ord. No. 2456-2009, § 1, 8-18-09) 
Sec. 38-199. - Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities. 
(a)  Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the engineer, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article. The easement agreement shall be recorded by the inspector in the land records. 
(b)  Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the inspector and recorded into the land record prior to final plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. 
    The governing body, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this chapter and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
(c)  Requirements for maintenance covenants. All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the stormwater coordinator, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. 
(d)  Inspection of stormwater facilities. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices. 
(e)  Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the stormwater coordinator the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(f)  Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least five years. These records shall be made available to the stormwater coordinator during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
(g)  Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the stormwater coordinator, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the stormwater coordinator shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have ten days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the stormwater coordinator may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the county. The city may collect any unpaid assessment as a personal debt of the owner(s), as well as foreclose a lien against any real property upon which a lien has been attached. 
(Ord. No. 2456-2009, § 1, 8-18-09) 
Sec. 38-200. - Enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  Violations. Any development activity that is commenced or is conducted contrary to this article may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. 
(b)  Notice of violation. When the stormwater coordinator determines that an activity is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this article, he/she shall issue a written notice of violation to the owner of the property. The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the owner or applicant; 
(2)  The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(4)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the development activity into compliance with this article and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action; 
(5)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; 
(6)  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the community and development director by filing a written notice of appeal with 15 days of service of notice of violation. 
(c)  Stop work orders. Persons receiving a notice of violation will be required to halt all construction activities. This stop work order will be in effect until the stormwater coordinator confirms that the development activity is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of violation in a timely manner can result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this article. 
(d)  Civil and criminal penalties. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a violation of any provisions of this chapter is a class C offense, punishable as provided in chapter 1, section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(e)  Restoration of lands. Any person or entity found to be in violation of these regulations may be required to restore land to its undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, the stormwater coordinator may take necessary corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until paid. 
(f)  Holds on occupation permits. Occupation permits will not be granted until corrections to all stormwater practices have been made and accepted by the stormwater coordinator.

Such person shall sign the certificate under oath and shall include in the certificate an attestation as to the result of the analysis. The presentation of this certificate to the municipal court by any party to a proceeding shall be evidence that all of the requirements and provisions of this section have been complied with. This certificate shall be supported by a written declaration pursuant to K.S.A. 53-601 and amendments thereto or shall be sworn to before a notary public or other person empowered by law to take oaths and shall contain a statement establishing the following: the type of analysis performed; the result achieved; any conclusions reached based upon that result; that the subscriber is the person who performed the analysis and made the conclusions; the subscriber's training or experience to perform the analysis; the nature and condition of the equipment used; and the certification and foundation requirements for admissibility of breath test results, when appropriate.

(2)  Overview. This section [through section 62-25] is designed to regulate noise by various alternative means in order to allow the enforcement of noise regulations at times when and by persons for whom noise meters are not available. A noise may be in violation of this section [through section 62-25] because it is disturbing to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities or because it exceeds the decibel level restrictions provided below [in section 62-22]. If a noise violates more than one of these provisions, the violation will be enforced under whichever provision is most applicable to the situation, as determined by a code enforcement or law enforcement officer of the city. 
(b)  Definitions. 
    Ambient noise means the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from all sources at the location, constituting the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location. 
    A-weighting (dBA) means the sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighted network. The level so read is designated dB(A) or dBA. 
    Commercial means property in the following city zoning districts: 
"CO" Office and Service Business District "C-1" Neighborhood Shopping District "C-2" General Commercial District "C-3" Central Business District "P-F" Public Facilities District  
    Decibel (dBA) means the unit of measurement for sound pressure at a specified location. 
    Governmental function means work conducted by a governmental entity in the interest of the community. 
    Sound level means the instantaneous sound pressure level measured in decibels obtained by the use of a sound level meter set for A-weighting on slow integration speed, unless otherwise noted. 
    Residential means property in the following city zoning districts: 
"R-1" Single-Family Residential District "R-2" Single-Family Residential District "R-3" Limited Multiple-Family Residential District "R-4" Multiple-Family Residential District "R-C" Condominium-Townhouse District "MHP-MHS" Mobile Home Park and Mobile Subdivision District  
    Unreasonable noise means: 
(1)  Any unreasonably loud, disturbing, and unnecessary noise which causes material distress, discomfort or injury to persons of ordinary sensibilities in the immediate vicinity thereof; or 
(2)  Any noise of such character, intensity and continued duration which substantially interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of persons of ordinary sensibilities in residential zoning districts. 
(Ord. No. 2659-2014, § 1, 8-5-14) 
Sec. 62-22. - Noise-Restrictions on decibel levels. 
(a)  Maximum sound levels. During the times and in the zoning districts set out below, the activities that create a sound pressure level on the complainant's real property line that exceeds the maximum allowable sound level (dBA) below are declared to be public nuisances: 
(1)  All residential zoning districts: 
Daytime: 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. - 70 dBA 
Nighttime: 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. - 60 dBA 
(2)  All commercial zoning districts: 
Daytime: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. - 80 dBA

11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. - Existing ambient (dBA) 
(b)  Method of noise measurement. Noise measurements shall be a minimum of 30 seconds in duration. Decibel levels are measured from the complainant's real property line. In residential zoning districts adjacent to commercial zoning districts, the residential decibel levels apply when measured from the source of the noise in a commercial zoning district. In residential housing units that share a common wall or are located in a housing, apartment, or condominium project, decibel levels are measured at or in the complainant's housing unit. Violations will be determined based on the highest registered reading in that measurement period. All measurement levels will be inclusive of any ambient noise that exists at the time of the measurement.

(2)  The distinguishing historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match as closely as possible the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historical materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(11)  No significant change shall be made in the work defined in the certificate of appropriateness application after issuance of a certificate of appropriateness without resubmittal and approval thereof in the same manner provided herein.

Review of such application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be as provided herein. 
(b)  For a project which involves demolition of a historic landmark property or properties within a historic district, the proponents of such project shall, before doing any of the demolition or work in furtherance of such project, file an application for a certificate of appropriateness for review as provided herein.

In addition to the recommendation of the landmarks commission, the governing body shall consider the state of repair of the building, the reasonableness of the cost of restoration or repair, owner hardship, the purpose of preserving the designated historic landmark or structure within a historic district, alternatives presented by interested parties, the character of the neighborhood, the economic consequences to the city and the affected owner(s), and all other factors which it finds appropriate. The owner(s) of the historic landmark or owner(s) of the structure within the historic district shall bear the burden of proof demonstrating hardship. 
(d)  The governing body may approve the certificate of appropriateness, or deny the certificate of appropriateness if it determines that feasible alternatives to demolition or moving of the historic landmark or structure within the residential historic district exist and that in the interest of preserving historical values, the historic landmark or structure within the historic district should not be demolished or moved.

All personal financial documents and the information contained therein shall be considered proprietary and confidential, and shall be returned to the affected property owner upon said determination.

(d)  Except as provided in subsection (e), in addition to or in lieu of any other sentence authorized by law, whenever a person is convicted of having violated, while under 21 years of age, a City ordinance prohibiting an act prohibited by K.S.A. 21-5701 through 21-5717, and amendments thereto, or K.S.A. 8-1599, 41-719 or 41-727, and amendments thereto, the municipal judge shall order such person to submit to and complete an alcohol and drug evaluation by a community-based alcohol and drug safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee established by that statute for such evaluation.

37.020 SIGNS AND ADVERTISING. The use of any portion of a tower for advertisements or signs other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited.
37.030 SETBACK REQUIREMENTS. Except as otherwise specified in this Article, towers and accessory utility buildings shall be set back from surrounding properties and public rights-of-way a distance equal to one half the height of the tower, or a distance equal to the setback requirements of the underlying zoning district which pertain to principle structures, whichever is greater. The Board of Zoning Appeals may alter these setback requirements in accordance with Article 28 and/or 29 with such conditions, as they deem appropriate.
(A) Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and a public street, except that on sites adjacent to public streets on all sides, towers may be placed between a principle structure and a local street.
(B) In order to allow for the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a church steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure, a tower's setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a public street varied, at the discretion of the City Commission, following a recommendation from the Planning Commission.
37.040 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. Adequate precautions shall be taken to protect the
200 rev. August 12, 2015
general public from hazards produced by the tower(s) such as falling ice, tower failure, etc.
37.050 HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.
(A) The maximum height of any tower in a residential zoning district, including all antennas and other attachments, shall not exceed thirty five (35) feet above a roof support or seventy (70) feet above a ground support, unless necessary to integrate a tower into an existing structure such as a church steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure. However, towers in excess of fifty (50) feet above a ground support or fifteen (15) feet above a roof support are required to be reviewed and approved as required by Article 29.
(B) The maximum height of any tower in a non-residential zoning district, including all antennas and other attachments, shall not exceed one foot for every two (2) feet the tower is set back from residentially zoned property, not to exceed a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above a ground support or fifty (50) feet above a roof support. However, multi-user towers may exceed the height limitations by up to twenty (20) feet.
(C) The Board of Appeals shall impose such restrictions, terms, time limitations, landscaping, and other appropriate safeguards to protect adjoining property.
37.060 CO-LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.
(A) Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two (2) additional users if the tower is over one hundred (100) feet in height or for at least one additional user if the tower is between sixty (60) feet and one hundred (100) feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
(B) A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunications service tower shall not be approved unless the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one (1) mile search radius (one half [1/2] mile search radius for towers under one hundred and twenty [120] feet in height, one quarter [1/4] mile search radius for towers under eighty [80] feet in height) of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
(1) The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
(2) The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building as
201 rev. August 12, 2015
documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(3) Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
(4) Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building.
(C) If a proposed antenna cannot be located on an existing tower for any of the above reasons, the applicant shall provide documentation from a qualified and licensed professional engineer certifying the applicability of one or more of the above conditions.
37.070 LIGHTS AND OTHER ATTACHMENTS. No antenna or tower shall have affixed or attached to it in any way, except during time of repair or installation, any lights, reflectors, flashers or other illuminating device, except as required by the Federal Aviation Agency or the Federal Communications Commission, nor shall any tower have constructed thereon or attached thereto, in any way, any platform, catwalk crow's nest, or like structure, except during periods of construction or repair. When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be attached to the tower.
37.080 RADIATION STANDARD All proposed antennas shall comply with current standards of the Federal Communications Commission for non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (NIER) and electromagnetic fields (EMF). Each application for a communication tower shall include certified documentation or a statement from a registered engineer indicating compliance with these standards. Amateurs covered under FCC part 97.13(c) shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
37.090 EXISTING ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
(A) Towers existing prior to the passage of this Ordinance may continue in use for the purpose now used and as now existing but may not be replaced or structurally altered without complying in all respects with this article, unless authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Article 28 of the Zoning Regulations.
(B) If a tower existing prior to the passage of this Ordinance is hereafter damaged more than fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value, such tower shall not be restored except in conformance with regulations. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make the determination of fair market value in accordance with Article 21.090.2.
37.100 NON-CONFORMING USES. Towers or other antenna mounts that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, although additions to the property, shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
37.110 LETTER OF INTENT. Building permit applications for all commercial wireless telecommunication service towers shall include a letter of intent to be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Finney County, Kansas. The Letter of Intent shall commit the tower owner
202 rev. August 12, 2015
and his or her successors to allow the shared use of the tower if an additional user agrees in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for shared use.
(A) The Letter of Intent shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of Finney County, Kansas, which shall recite that a copy of this Letter of Compliance shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of the City and the office of Planning and Community Development Department of the City, and is there available for inspection and copying during normal business hours. This letter shall constitute covenants that run with the land and are binding on successors in interest.
37.120 REMOVAL OF ABANDONED OR UNUSED TOWERS.
(A) All abandoned or unused towers and associated facilities and structures shall be removed within twelve (12) months of the cessation of operations at the site unless the Planning Director approves a time extension. In the event that a tower is not removed within twelve (12) months of the cessation of operations at a site, the tower and associated facilities may be removed by the City and the costs of removal assessed against the property.
(B) Unused portions of towers above a manufactured connection shall be removed within six (6) months of the time of antenna relocation. The replacement of portions of a tower previously removed requires the issuance of a new building and/or conditional use permit.
37.130 INTERFERENCE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS. No new or existing telecommunications service shall interfere with public safety communications. All applications for new service shall be accompanied by an intermodulation study, which provides a technical evaluation of existing and proposed transmissions and indicates all potential interference problems. Before the introduction of new service or changes in existing service, telecommunication providers shall notify the City at least ten calendar days in advance of such changes and allow the City to monitor interference levels during the testing process.

public infrastructure.
I. The City may require the applicant of a subdivision to extend offsite improvements to
reach the subdivision or oversize required public facilities to serve anticipated future
development as a condition of plat approval, subject to the Development Agreement.
Section 70-2: 9.020 EASEMENTS.
A. Easements provided for front lot line utilities shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide.
B. When topography or subdivision layout make the placement of utilities only along the
front lot easement impractical, additional easements along the rear lot lines shall be

Section 70-2: 9.040 LOTS
A. Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing
building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning Regulation and in
providing access to buildings on the lots from an approved street.
1. Residential lots adjacent to arterial streets shall be platted with extra depth to
permit increased distances between the buildings and traffic-ways.
Therefore, variations from lot design standards are appropriate when lots
directly abut buffer areas.
2. Where lots front upon a cul-de-sac or curved street having a radius of two
hundred (200) feet or less, the minimum lot widths set forth above, shall be
measured at the building setback line along an arc parallel to the right-of-way
of such cul-de-sac or curved street. Such lots shall also be laid out so that
their lot frontage on the right-of-way line, is not less than fifty percent (50%)
of the required lot width measured at the building setback line.
3. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate
building setback from, and orientation to both streets.
4. Frontage and side yard setback requirements shall be the same on both
sides of the street for residential structures to provide a consistent line of
sight throughout the entire subdivision. Recorded final plats, and current
preliminary plats, shall be exempt from this Section.
B. Lot Dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the
Zoning Regulations. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
erection of buildings, observing the minimum yard setbacks from both streets. The
depth of a lot shall not exceed three (3) times its width.
C. Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be
avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development
from arterials or collectors.
D. Large lots or Parcels. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary
building lots, such parcels shall be arranged in such a manner as to allow for the
opening of future streets and logical further re-subdividing of the parcel. Lot splits
are prohibited in final platted subdivisions where additional buildable lots are
created.
E. Access from Major and Secondary Arterials. Lots shall not, in general, derive
access exclusively from an arterial or collector street. Where driveway access from
an arterial or collector street is necessary for two or more adjoining lots, the
Planning Commission may require that such lots be served by joint use access
drives in order to limit traffic movements. Driveways shall be designed and
arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back onto an arterial or collector street.
F. Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from
all buildings and alleys, and individual lot drainage shall be in conformance with the
approved subdivision drainage plan.
G. Debris and Waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk,
rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or
deposited on any lot or street. Removal of such items prior to any final plat or lot split
is required.

type of development contemplated.
C. Block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed the lesser of one thousand two
hundred (1,200) feet or twelve (12x) times the minimum lot width required in the
zoning district.
D. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials and collector streets shall not be
less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length.
E. In blocks more than eight hundred (800) feet long the Planning Commission may
require the dedication of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities or
bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian ways or easements, shall not be less than
fifteen (15) feet wide.
Section 70-2: 9.060 ALLEYS
A. Alleys are not a requirement for development within the City.

A. Proposed roads and streets shall provide a safe, convenient, and functional system
for vehicular and pedestrian traffic; and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic
characteristics of each proposed development. Proposed roads shall comply with
the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Level of Service. No development shall be approved if such development, at full
occupancy, will result in or increase traffic on so that the street does not function at a
proper level of service as determined by the City Engineer.
C. Excess Right-of-Way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in
these regulations may be required due to topography or additional future traffic
movements.

D. Topography & Arrangement. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the
continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when the continuation
is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient
provision of utilities, and where the continuation is in accordance with the City
approved Surface Transportation Plan.

topography.
3. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
4. All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system.
5. All streets shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as
industries, business districts, schools, churches, shopping centers and
population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
6. Local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the
topography to discourage use by through (non-local) traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
7. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be
subdivided for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of the area.
E. In business and industrial developments, the streets and other access ways shall be
planned not to conflict movement between the various types of traffic, including
pedestrian.
F. Intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles, but in no case less than seventy-five (75º) degrees.
1. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should
be within seventy-five (75º) degrees for at least one hundred (100) feet there
from.
2. Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at one point.
3. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall directly
coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street.
4. Where streets intersect arterial or collector streets, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersections with arterials shall be at least five hundred (500)
feet apart, intersections with collectors three hundred (300) feet apart, local
street intersections with centerline offsets of less than one hundred-fifty
(150) feet shall not be permitted.
5. Where any street intersection would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the Subdivider/Developer shall provide adequate sight distance as
required by the City Engineer.
G. Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited access
highways located adjacent to or abutting the subdivision shall be treated as follows:
1. In residential districts a buffer strip at least twenty-five (25) feet in depth in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided
adjacent to the railroad or highway right-of-way. This strip shall be part of the
platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: This strip is reserved for
screening. The placement of structures on this land is prohibited.
GARDEN CITY SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
ORD #2300 - JULY 1, 2005

2. In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses the nearest
proposed street shall be parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad or
highway right-of-way and shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient
distance to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
3. When streets parallel to the railroad or highway intersect a street, which
crosses the railroad or highway at grade, they shall, to the extent practicable,
intersect at a distance determined by the City Engineer or at least one
hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad or highway right-of-way. Such
distance shall take into account the minimum distance required for future
planned grade separation.
H. New Perimeter Streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as
to eliminate new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to
a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by
the Subdivider/Developer.
I. The Planning Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the
Subdivider/Developer improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way
width within its own subdivision boundaries.
J. Widening and Realignment of Existing Roads. Where a subdivision borders an
existing narrow road, or right-of-way, or when the Comprehensive Plan, or Surface
Transportation Plan indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that would
require additional right-of-way from the subdivision, the Subdivider/Developer shall
dedicate and may be required to improve at its expense those areas for widening or
realignment of those roads.
1. Frontage roads and streets as described above shall be improved and
dedicated by the applicant at its own expense to the full width as required by
these subdivision regulations when the applicant's development activities
contribute to the need for the road expansion.
2. Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard
or area requirements of the Zoning Regulation whether the land is to be
dedicated to the City in fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
K. Dead-End Streets or Roads. No Permanent dead end streets shall be approved.
However, If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must temporarily be
a dead-end street, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line.
1. A temporary cul-de-sac or T- or L-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all
temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that
land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever
the street is continued.

and receive the approval of the Governing Body. Such dedication of land or
cash-in-lieu payments shall be assessed and collected prior to approval of
the final plat but after approval of the preliminary plat.
2. The park open space parcel shall be a cohesive whole but may be of
irregular outline or shape.
3. Each park or open space shall have frontage on a public street.
4. Public access shall take into account the need for adequate frontage on a
public street and the amount of frontage reasonably required by the
circumstances of the particular open space.
5. This frontage may serve as a corridor from the public street to the main body
of the park area, which the Governing Body deems necessary to provide
acceptable access to the open space from the public street. This corridor
shall have a gradient adequate for pedestrian or vehicle use.
C. Standards. The Planning Commission may require that land be reserved for parks
and playgrounds or other recreation purposes in locations designated in the
Comprehensive Plan or the City Parks and Tree Advisory Board Park Plan or
otherwise where such reservations would be appropriate. Each reservation shall be
of suitable size, dimension, topography, and general character and shall have
adequate road access for the particular purposes envisioned. Lands to be dedicated
or reserved for park and open space purposes shall have prior approval of the

D. Drainage facilities. Drainage facilities may be coordinated with park, open space or
recreation purposes; however, such use will require recommendation, for approval to
the Governing Body, by the City Engineer and the affected departments.
E. Minimum Size of Park and Recreation Dedication or Reservation. In general,
land dedicated or reserved for such purposes shall be at least four (4) acres. The
required park and recreation area are established on the basis of providing two (2)
acres of recreation area for every one hundred (100) dwelling units, or eight hundred
seventy (870) square feet per lot set aside. However, the Planning Commission may
require that a park or recreation area be provided at a suitable place on the edge of
the subdivision so that additional land may be added when the adjacent land is
subdivided. The Planning Commission shall refer such proposed reservations to the
appropriate City official for recommendation.
1. Land dedicated or reserved for park recreation or community open space
purpose shall be of a character and location suitable for use as a playground,
play field, or for other recreation/open space purposes, and shall be relatively
level and dry, unless developed in conjunction with drainage requirements of
the subdivision, whereupon the area of recreation or open space shall be
signed to warn of potential temporary flooding.

Improvement Fund to be established by the Governing Body.
b. The deposit shall be used by the City for improvement of a neighborhood
park, playground, or recreation area and may include the acquisition of
property. The amount to be deposited shall be charged at the rate of two
hundred dollars ($200) per lot for each lot, which has not had the
appropriate land reservation as required.

difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, and/or the
purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative
proposal, it may:
1. Approve variances, exceptions, and waiver of conditions to these subdivision
regulations provided that the variance, exception, or waiver conditions shall
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations;
2. Further provided the Planning Commission shall not approve variances,
exceptions, and waiver of conditions unless it shall make findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case as follows:
a. The granting of the variance, exception, or waiver of conditions will not be
detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other
property;
b. The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the
property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property;
c. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
