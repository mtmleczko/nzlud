PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature, and was originally published in 1985. The Code was subsequently republished in 1994, 2002, 2008 and 2013. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Code Comparative Table appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. The Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature, prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the city, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the eleventh section of chapter 5 is 5-11. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-1 and 1-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-1.1, 1-1.2 and 1-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up to date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-7. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been replaced shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.

For example, the codifier may:

Any such person redeeming or purchasing any such dog or puppy shall pay to the city pound or authorized rabies control center for the lodging and board of said dog, plus a fee for vaccination, if required and said dog or puppy shall be released from impoundment.

(Ord. No. 2382, § 1(5-145), 1-23-12)

Upon filing of the notice of appeal and approval of the bond, the circuit clerk of the court shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the city clerk and the appeal shall be docketed in the circuit court, and shall be a preferred case therein. The city clerk shall, upon receiving the notice, file with the circuit clerk a copy of the findings and determination of the city council in its proceedings. Any trials shall be held without jury upon the determination of the city council that the building or structure is unsafe to the extent that it is a public nuisance. 
(d)  After 20 days of the decision of the city council, if a repair, move, or demolition is ordered by the city council and if an appeal has not been taken to the circuit court as provided for by subsection 5-146(c), then the repair, move, or demolition may be accomplished by the city by the use of its own forces, or it may provide by contract for the repair or demolition. In the event that an appeal is taken to the circuit court as provided for by subsection 5-146(c), once a judgment authorizing a repair, move, or demolition becomes final as provided by law, then the repair, the move, or the demolition may be accomplished by the city by the use of its own forces, or it may provide by contract for the repair, the move, or the demolition. 
(e)  A failure by the city to accomplish the repair, move, or demolition of a building, structure, part of building or structure, party wall, or foundation within 180 days of the passage of the resolution ordering the same shall constitute an abdication of the city council's order unless one of the following conditions is satisfied:

(2)  A court of competent jurisdiction has enjoined or otherwise halted the repair, move, or demolition; 
(3)  All parties identified by the appropriate municipal official pursuant to subsection 5-145(b)(1) have entered into a written agreement allowing for an extended period of time within which the repair, move, or demolition may be accomplished; 
(4)  All parties identified by the appropriate municipal official pursuant to subsection 5-145(b)(1) have noted at a meeting of the city council their agreement allowing for an extended period of time within which the repair, move, or demolition may be accomplished and the agreement is reflected in the minutes of the city council; or 
(5)  Further action is taken by the city council as provided by subsection (f) of this section. 
(f)  If for any reason an ordered repair, move, or demolition cannot be accomplished within 180 days of the passage of the resolution ordering the same, the appropriate municipal official shall make a report of the same and the length of any desired extension to the city council. The city clerk shall distribute a copy of the report to the members of the city council. The city clerk shall set the report on the proposed extension for a public hearing at a meeting of the city council. The city clerk shall give no less than ten days notice of the meeting at which the proposed extension is to be considered by first-class mail to all persons or entities listed in subsection 5-145(b)(1). Notice shall be deemed complete upon mailing. Any person, firm, or corporation having an interest in the property may be heard at the meeting as to any objection to the proposed extension or the length thereof. Following the public hearing, the city council may adopt a resolution extending the time for the repair, move, or demolition to be accomplished for such period of time as it deems necessary. The city council need not order an extension before the time to complete the repair, move, or demolition expires in order for the extension to be effective, but if the city council desires to extend the time to complete the repair, move, or demolition, then the city council must order the extension no more than 60 days after the expiration of the then existing deadline to complete the repair, move, or demolition. 
(g)  Nothing in this article shall prevent the city from reinitiating the proceedings authorized by this article at any time so long as all the requirements of this article are satisfied anew.

The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property except liens for taxes, and shall continue in force until paid. The city clerk shall file a certified copy of the resolution in the office of the Judge of Probate of Jefferson County, Alabama, Birmingham Division, and with the Jefferson County Tax Collector's office. In the case of a final assessment resulting from a move or demolition accomplished pursuant to this article, upon filing, the tax collector or revenue commissioner of the county shall add the amount of the lien to the ad valorem tax bill on the property and shall collect the amount as if it were a tax and remit the amount to the city.

(a)  The official, bearing proper identification, may enter and inspect all land-disturbing activities for regular periodic inspections, investigations, monitoring, observations, measurements, enforcement, sampling and testing to verify compliance with the provisions of this article and the specific BMP plans and control plans for such land-disturbing activities. The official shall notify the owner of such property, his contact person or his representative on the construction site prior to inspection, and the inspections shall be conducted at reasonable times. The owner or operator of a construction site with respect to which an NPDES permit has been issued shall provide the official with the information required in section 5.5-40(c) prior to the commencement of the work on the construction site. The official shall inspect the construction site to confirm the implementation and the maintenance of BMP plans, otherwise, such site shall be inspected when the official believes, as a result of complaints or monitoring activity, that land-disturbing activities on the site are causing a substantial pollutant loading which threatens the MS4. 
(b)  Upon the refusal by any property owner to allow the official to enter, or to continue an inspection on, a site on which land-disturbing activities or construction work is being done, the official shall terminate the inspection or confine the inspection to areas to which no objection is raised. If an agent of the official was making, or attempting to make, such inspection, the agent shall promptly report to the official the refusal and the reasons for the refusal, if the reasons are known by the agent. The official may seek appropriate legal remedies to enable him to make or complete such inspection, including seeking appropriate legal remedies from any court having jurisdiction over the matter. If the court grants a remedy to the official, the property owner must reimburse the city all of the costs and expenses incurred by the city in obtaining such remedy, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. 
(c)  If the official has reasonable cause to believe that discharges from the land-disturbing activities to the MS4 may cause an imminent threat to human health or the environment, an inspection of the site may take place at any time and without notice to the owner of the property or a representative on site. The official shall present proper credentials upon request of the owner or his representative. 
(d)  At any time during the conduct of an inspection, or at such other times as the official may request information from an owner or his representative, the owner or representative may identify areas of its business, material or processes which contain a trade secret and an inspection of which might reveal such trade secret. If the official has no clear and convincing reason to question such assertion of the owner or his representative, the inspection report shall note that trade secret information has been omitted. To the extent practicable, the official shall protect all information which is designated as a trade secret by the owner or his representative.

No. 1688, Arts. 1-6, adopted July 7, 1999. 

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 5.5-200. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Code of Ala. 1975, tit. 11, ch. 19, §§ 1-24, ch. 45, §§ 1-11, ch. 52, §§ 1-84, and tit. 41, ch. 9, § 166, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Vestavia Hills, Alabama, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 2429, § 2, Art. 1, § A, 1-28-13) 
Sec. 5.5-201. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Vestavia Hills, Alabama, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2429, § 2, Art. 1, § B, 1-28-13) 
Sec. 5.5-202. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 2429, § 2, Art. 1, § C, 1-28-13) 
Sec. 5.5-203. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves and other coverings and devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.

(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 2429, § 2, Art. 4, § A, 1-28-13) 
Sec. 5.5-277. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 5.5-276(4), "elevated buildings." 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 5.5-253(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet) above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer: division 4, section 5.5-276) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of division 4 subsection 5.5-277(3)a.3., above. 
(4)  Standards for subdivisions. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(Ord. No. 2429, § 2, Art. 4, § B, 1-28-13) 
Sec. 5.5-278. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in 5.5-212 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge.

Sec. 5.5-301. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The flood hazard appeal board (Vestavia Hills Board of Zoning Adjustment) as established by the Vestavia Hills City Council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the flood hazard appeal board may appeal such decision to the Jefferson County Civil Court as provided in Code of Alabama 1975. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the flood hazard appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the flood hazard appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

(4)  Cost of abatement of the violation. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 10 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the city by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than 12 equal payments. Interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the first day following discovery of the violation. 
(5)  Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article, the city may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. 
(6)  Compensatory action . In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this article, the city may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
(7)  Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.

The municipal court may waive appearance bond upon a satisfactory showing that the defendant is indigent or otherwise unable to provide a surety bond.

(g)  Arrest. Upon the receipt of notice of dismissal of an appeal, the municipal court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the defendant, who may also be arrested without a warrant as an escapee. Upon arrest, the defendant shall be delivered to the city authorities and punished in accordance with the judgment of the municipal court. 
(h)  Judgment against defendant. If a judgment is entered against a defendant on appeal, the circuit court shall remand the defendant to the city authorities for punishment in accordance with the judgment of the circuit court, unless, when the judgment is for fine and costs only, the judgment is paid or a judgment is conferred therefor in favor of the city with sureties or as otherwise provided for convictions under state law. 
(i)  Disposition of fines, costs. Upon receipt of payment of fines, forfeitures and costs upon appeals, the clerk of the circuit court shall within 30 days pay 90 percent of such fines and forfeitures, and ten percent of the costs, to the treasurer of the city. The circuit clerk shall be liable on his bond for such fines and costs plus a penalty of five percent per month for default in such payments; 
(j)  Appeal to court of criminal appeals. From the judgment of the circuit court, the city, in a case holding invalid an ordinance, or the defendant in any case, may appeal to the court of criminal appeals in like manner as in cases of appeals for convictions of violation of the criminal laws of the state. If the appeal is taken by the city, it shall not be required to give surety for the cost of the appeal. When taken by the defendant, he may give bail with sufficient sureties, conditioned that he will appear and abide by the judgment of the appellate court, and failing to give bail he must be committed to the city jail; but he may give such bail at any time pending the appeal. When an appeal is taken by the defendant and bail is given pending the appeal, and the judgment of conviction is affirmed or the appeal is dismissed, the defendant is bound by the undertaking of bail to surrender himself to the city authorities within 15 days from the date of such affirmance or dismissal, and if he shall fail to do so, the clerk of the circuit court from which the appeal is taken, upon motion of the city, must endorse the bail bond forfeited, and a writ or writs of arrest must be issued by the clerk to the sheriff. Upon arrest the defendant shall be delivered to the city authorities and the sentence must without delay be carried out as if no appeal had been taken. If bail is forfeited as provided in this section, a conditional judgment must be entered by the court in favor of the city and the same proceedings had thereon for the city as is authorized by law to be had in the name of the state in state cases.

(1)  Misdemeanor. It shall be the duty of every occupant of or person in possession of or in charge or control of the lower or ground floor or story of any house, building or structure, whether the same be used for dwelling or other purpose, and of every owner or agent or person in charge or control of any vacant lot abutting, situated on or facing any sidewalk that has been provided with curbing or that has been paved, macadamized or otherwise improved, to keep such sidewalk so bordering such premises and one-half of the street both in front and on the side thereof, free from grass, weeds or other voluntary or spontaneous growth of like nature, and any owner or agent, occupant or person in possession of or in charge or control of any of the premises described in this section who shall permit such grass, weeds or other voluntary or spontaneous growth to obtain a height of over 12 inches shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

However, any defendant charged pursuant to this section must appear in court to answer the charged offense and may not plead guilty before a magistrate. 
(b)  Applicability and intent. An abundance of overgrown grass or weeds within the corporate limits of the city that is injurious to the general public health, safety, and general welfare by providing breeding grounds and shelter for rats, mice, snakes, mosquitoes, and other vermin, insects, and pests; or attaining heights and dryness that constitute a serious fire threat or hazard; or bearing wingy or downy seeds, when mature, that cause the spread of weeds and, when breathed, irritation to the throat, lungs, and eyes of the public; or hiding debris, such as broken glass or metal, that could inflict injury on a person going upon the property; or being unsightly; or a growth of grass or weeds, other than ornamental plant growth, that exceeds 12 inches in height, may be declared to be a public nuisance by the city council and abated as provided this section. The term "corporate limits of the city" as defined in this section does not include the police jurisdiction of the city. 
(c)  Weeds and other vegetation-abatement. 
(1)  First demand. Whenever there is a growth of weeds to a height of over 12 inches or otherwise constituting a nuisance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the city compliance officer, the city clerk, the mayor and/or city manager, or any police officer of the city may serve notice upon the owner, occupant, and/or agent of owner or occupant of any improved lot or the owner and/or agent of the owner of any vacant lot where the nuisance is located demanding that the growth be cut within 48 hours. 
(2)  Setting of public hearing. If any such person or entity fails or refuses to cut such vegetation within such time as provided in subsection (a)(1), then the city compliance officer, the city clerk, the mayor and/or city manager, or any police officer of the city may set the matter for a public hearing to determine whether the nuisance should be abated. Said persons may set the matter for a public hearing by requesting that the mayor and/or city manager or city clerk add the matter to the applicable meeting agenda of the city council. Alternatively, whether or not the first demand provided for by subsection (a)(1) has been made, whenever there is a growth of weeds to a height of over 12 inches or otherwise constituting a nuisance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the city clerk may, by resolution, set a public hearing to determine whether the nuisance should be abated. In either case, such public hearing shall be set for the next meeting of the city council that is at least ten calendar days from the date that notice is served upon the owner, occupant, and/or agent of owner or occupant of any improved lot or the owner and/or agent of the owner of any vacant lot where the nuisance is located or at any meeting thereafter. Although notice of a public hearing need not adhere to any particular form, it should inform the person or entity served of the time, date, and place of the hearing and the reason for the hearing. 
(3)  Service. Service under this section shall be made by delivering a copy to the owner, occupant, and/or agent of owner or occupant of any improved lot or the owner and/or agent of the owner of any vacant lot where the nuisance is located or by mailing it to the owner, occupant, and/or agent of owner or occupant of any improved lot or the owner and/or agent of the owner of any vacant lot where the nuisance is located at said person or entity's last known address. Delivery of a copy under this section means: handing it to the owner, occupant, and/or agent of owner or occupant of any improved lot or the owner and/or agent of the owner of any vacant lot where the nuisance is located; or leaving it at said person or entity's office with a clerk or other person in charge thereof; or, if there is no one in charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; or leaving it at the person's dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein; or by leaving it in a conspicuous place at the lot or parcel (whether improved or not) where the nuisance is located. Service by mail is complete upon mailing. For purposes of this section, the person making service may (but is not required to) rely upon any information appearing on record in the office of the Jefferson County Tax Assessor to establish the identity of an owner of property or to establish a person or entity's last known address, which if utilized shall be deemed conclusive and sufficient proof of the same. 
(4)  Optional notice. The city compliance officer, the city clerk, the mayor and/or city manager, and/or any police officer of the city is authorized within his sole discretion, but not required, to utilize any additional means of providing notice deemed appropriate. Specifically, said persons are authorized to, but not limited to, provide this additional, optional notice by placement of notice in a public place or places located within the city, by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation published in the city as often and for as long as deemed appropriate, or by the placement of a sign or signs upon the offending property. The additional, optional notice provided for in this subsection may be provided in whatever form the person giving notice deems appropriate in his sole discretion. Any person, other than a city officer, agent, or employee, who removes a sign or notice placed pursuant to this subsection prior to the time that the offending growth is cut or abated in its entirety shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(5)  Public hearing. At the time stated in the notice for the public hearing, the city council shall hear and consider all evidence, objections, and protests regarding the proposed removal of weeds. The city council (either by vote of simple majority of those present or through the direction of the mayor and/or city manager as chair of the meeting) may continue the hearing from time to time. 
(6)  Resolution to abate. After public hearing, if it is found that there is a growth of weeds to a height of over 12 inches or otherwise constituting a nuisance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the city council may, by resolution, declare the weeds to be a public nuisance and order its abatement. The resolution shall refer to the street by the name under which it is commonly known or describe the property upon which or in front of which the nuisance exists by giving a legal description of the property and no other description of the property shall be required. Any number of streets, sidewalks, or parcels of private property may be included in one resolution. The city council, by passage of the resolution, shall be deemed to have acquired jurisdiction to proceed and either to perform or have performed the work of removal or abatement with respect to the property or part thereof. The decision of the city council on the matter shall be deemed final and conclusive. 
(7)  Abatement of nuisance. After the city council passes the resolution finding the conditions of the property to be a nuisance and ordering its abatement, all officers, employees, and agents of the city may enter upon the private property to abate the nuisance. Alternatively, the city council may authorize private contractors, companies, enterprises, or individuals to abate and remove the nuisance. The city council (by resolution), the mayor and/or city manager, and/or any other agent, officer, or employee of the city so authorized by the mayor and/or city manager shall designate the contractors, companies, enterprises, or individuals who may perform the work. Those persons so designated may enter upon private property for purposes of abating or removing the nuisance. For purposes of this section, compliance with the competitive bid law is not required. 
(8)  City compliance officer. For purposes of this section, this city compliance officer shall be the city police officer and/or any other agent, officer, or employee of the city so authorized by the mayor and/or city manager. 
(d)  Weeds and other vegetation-reporting, assessment, and collection of costs of abatement. 
(1)  Reporting of costs. The city adopts Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-67-65, as that section may be amended or renumbered over time as its procedures for the reporting of costs of abating or removing a nuisance. However, this subsection (d)(1) is merely directory, and failure to comply with this provision shall not render any weed lien void or otherwise invalidate an action or omission of a city officer, agent, or employee when he is exercising his discretion. 
(2)  Weed lien-generally. After the abatement of any overgrown grass or weeds pursuant to the procedures provided in subsection (b) of this section, the costs of abatement shall be assessed and collected as a weed lien in the same manner as provided in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-67-66. 
(3)  Weed lien-state land. The city may assess the costs authorized against any lot or lots or parcel or parcels of land purchased by the State of Alabama or any purchaser at any sale for the nonpayment of taxes and where an assessment is made against a lot or lots or parcel or parcels of land, a subsequent redemption thereof by a person authorized to redeem or sale thereof by the state, shall not operate to discharge, or in any manner affect the lien of the city for the assessment, but a person redeeming the property or purchaser at a sale by the state of any lot or lots or parcel or parcels of land upon which an assessment has been levied, whether prior to or subsequent to a sale to the state or purchaser for the nonpayment of taxes, shall take the same subject to the assessment. 
(4)  Cumulative effect. This section is cumulative in nature and in addition to any and all power and authority that the city may have under any other law.

The cost of said mailing shall be paid by the owner of the property sought to be annexed.

(6)  Second notice to adjoining property owners. Pursuant to the requirements of Act Number 1123 of the Regular Session of the 1973 Alabama Legislature, the city shall again give written notice a minimum of 15 days prior to the proposed date of the rezoning public hearing before the city council, to all owners of property located in whole or in part within 500 feet from the boundaries of the property, which is the subject of the proposed change in zoning classification, as shown by the records of the office of the tax assessor of Jefferson County, Alabama. 
(7)  Preparation of ordinance. An ordinance shall be prepared proposing to change the Jefferson County zoning classification on the territory sought to be annexed to the municipality to the closest and most compatible Vestavia Hills classification. 
(8)  First publication in newspaper. Pursuant to the requirements of Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-77, the proposed ordinance shall be published in full for one insertion and an additional insertion of a synopsis of the proposed ordinance, one week after the first insertion, which synopsis shall refer to the date and name of the newspaper in which the proposed ordinance was first published; both such insertions shall be at least 15 days in advance of its passage and in a newspaper of general circulation published within the municipality. 
(9)  First posting of proposed ordinance. The proposed ordinance shall be posted in four conspicuous places within the city, together with a notice stating the time and place that the ordinance is to be considered by the municipal legislative authorities and stating further that at such time and place all persons who desire shall have an opportunity of being heard in opposition to or in favor of such ordinance. The four places for posting shall be the United States post office, the mayor's office at Vestavia Hills city hall, the Sear's Mall and the Alabama ABC store. 
(10)  Public hearing by city council. The city council shall conduct public hearings on the petition for annexation and the petition for rezoning at the same meeting. The annexation ordinance shall be adopted first and the rezoning ordinance shall be adopted immediately thereafter. Rezoning is not completed without adoption and approval of said ordinance.

    Board or BWWB means the Water Works and Sewer Board of the City of Birmingham. 
    Board of education means the Vestavia Hills Board of Education. 
    City means the City of Vestavia Hills. 
    City council means the City Council of the City of Vestavia Hills.

Whenever the mayor of the city determines (in consultation with such officials as he deems appropriate, including the board), that a water service emergency and/or water system failure exists in the city and that such emergency requires that certain uses of water not essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the city be restricted, the mayor, with the consensus of the city council, may issue and publish a declaration of the existence of such water service emergency which shall become effective immediately upon the publication of such declaration in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city for three consecutive days. In addition, the declaration of water service emergency shall be: 
(1)  Announced at all public meetings of the city council that are held during the water service emergency; and 
(2)  Posted during the water service emergency period at the Municipal Center of Vestavia Hills, the Vestavia Hills Civic Center, the Vestavia Hills Library, the Vestavia Hills branch of the United States Post Office and the Vestavia Hills Parks and Recreation.

(e)  Determination of drought management stages. On April 9, 2008, the board adopted and approved a drought management plan that established a water conservation plan for their service area. The plan detailed a "staged approach" to utilize several system and climatologically factors as triggers using performance measures, water demands or usage, reservoir levels, river flows and drought indices such as the Palmer Index and the Standardized Precipitation Index. The adopted policy sets forth five stages of drought levels including: 
 Stage 1 Drought Advisory; 
 Stage 2 Drought Watch; 
 Stage 3 Drought Warning; 
 Stage 4 Extreme Drought Emergency; 
 Stage 5 Exceptional Drought Emergency. 
    The board's planned stage 1 and stage 2 call for voluntary water conservation from its customers. All subsequent stages, if declared by the board, implement enforcement by the board with surcharges for excessive water usage. 
    The mayor and council agree it is in the best public interest to "mirror" the stage numbers as described within the drought management plan adopted by the board on April 9, 2008. However, a declaration of emergency shall only become effective upon recommendation of the mayor and a consensus of the city council following an implementation by the board to "stage 3 drought warning" and/or "stage 4 extreme drought emergency" and upon the determination (through consultation with the council, the board and other such officials as they deem appropriate) that extreme drought conditions have caused significant adverse impacts to the reliability of water resources and the ability of the board to adequately supply and meet future demands or usage requirements of its customers and that the public's health and safety are at risk.

The city strongly endorses and recommends that the board, which exclusively serves the city, establish reciprocal emergency water use agreements and install adequate connections to allow the transfer of water from one system to another in the event of drought or other disasters causing water shortages. Furthermore, it is recommended that similar agreements be established with other water systems that are geographically located to make such agreements workable and beneficial. This stage could result from drought intensity or other unrelated causes for the potable water supply system failure. In this stage, a significant or total failure of a water distribution system will have a disastrous effect on the city.

§3.3. - Interpretation of District Boundaries. 
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
3.3.1. Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately following centerlines of streets or alleys, lot lines, stream centerlines, property lines or corporate limit lines, such lines shall be considered to be such boundaries. 
3.3.2. Where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions shown on the map, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the Zoning Map. 
3.3.3. Authority for each entry made on the map must be found in the applicable Zoning Ordinance or Amendment. 
3.3.4. The controlling document for determining the zoning classification of any particular property in the City shall be in the Ordinance adopted and enacted by the council, which zoned or rezoned said parcel. 
3.3.5. Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by the preceding rules, the Board of Zoning Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as "the BZA" shall interpret the district boundaries. 
§3.4. - District Boundaries Established. 
The boundaries of each district are indicated upon the Zoning Map. Said map and all notations, references and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this Ordinance as is fully described herein. Said map shall be retained in the office of the City Clerk.

No permit shall be issued for Special Exception Uses, as indicated in the district regulations, except with the written approval of the BZA, and subject to such conditions as said BZA may require to preserve and protect the character of the District and otherwise promote the purposes of this Ordinance. 
Special Exceptions, unlike variances, do not require a showing of unnecessary hardship. A Special Exception denotes a species of administrative permission that allows property to be used in a manner which the regulations expressly permit and under conditions specified in this Ordinance though it may not be permissibly used as a substitute for a variance. A use prohibited by this Ordinance may not be authorized by Special Exception. See §12.3 Special Exceptions.

§4.7. - Condominiums. 
The condominium form of ownership is permitted in any and all Zoning Districts although the area and dimensional regulations for certain districts or uses may not directly relate to such form of property ownership, such as minimum lot areas, widths or yards. Therefore, condominiums shall not be held literally to such regulations; but instead shall be consistent with their intent. For example, if this Ordinance requires a minimum lot area of 10,000 sq. ft. for a particular district or use, such area shall be provided, although it is not within a separately owned lot, and shall not be counted toward another part of the same development. Similarly, in a district that requires a ten (10) foot side yard setback; there shall be a twenty (20) foot separation between the sides of buildings in a condominium development. 
Furthermore, when a district limits the intensity of development to one principal building per lot, such regulations shall not apply literally in the case of condominiums. In such case, more than one such building shall be permitted so long as the minimum (lot) area is provided per principal building.

a.  The maximum building height, for lots adjacent to any single-family residential district, shall be three (3) stories or forty-eight (48) feet, whichever is less. 
b.  The maximum building height for all other cases shall be five (5) stories or sixty (60) feet, whichever is less. 
4.  Streetscape Design. 
a.  All streets shall be designed to promote connectivity while calming traffic. 
b.  New streets may include on-street parking as approved by the City Engineer. 
c.  Sidewalks shall be installed along all street frontages as needed, and shall: 
(1)  Be completely interconnected within the site and from the site to adjacent public sidewalks; 
(2)  Be at least five (5) feet wide in primarily residential areas; 
(3)  Be at least eight (8) feet wide in primarily commercial areas; and 
(4)  Be separated from the street by a vertical curb. 
d.  A tree lawn, regularly spaced tree wells, planter boxes, and/or on-street parking shall be provided as a buffer between the roadway and sidewalk. 
e.  Planting strips and street trees shall be provided as required in the City Public Works Manual. 
5.  Building Design. Buildings shall be oriented to maximize the building frontage along the street. Building frontage may be less and a modest setback incorporated where necessary to provide an appropriate transition to adjacent neighborhoods. 
a.  Mixed-use buildings with street level commercial space shall be set back no more than five (5) feet from the sidewalk unless the proposed setback is to be a courtyard, plaza or similar public space. 
b.  Any residential units located within fifteen (15) feet of a public sidewalk shall be raised at least two (2) feet above the grade level of the sidewalk. 
c.  Buildings shall provide and maintain a public entrance along the street. Buildings shall be oriented toward the pedestrian by providing a direct link between the building and the existing and/or proposed pedestrian system. 
d.  Shading and protection from inclement weather, through awnings or canopies, shall be provided over public sidewalks to optimize pedestrian comfort. 
e.  Building service areas should be placed away from street view. 
6.  Open Space. 
a.  In primarily nonresidential areas at least fifteen (15) percent of the total site area shall be dedicated to open space. Where feasible, this should be fulfilled with a plaza, courtyard or similar public space in a central location adjacent to multiple buildings on the site.

3.  No sign may be attached to the dwelling or any part of the real estate advertising any home occupation. 
4.  No home occupation shall be permitted if it creates noise, odors, vibrations or traffic congestion, which interferes with the residential qualities of the neighborhood insofar as health, safety, morals, convenience and general welfare are concerned. 
5.  In order to be a permitted home occupation, the use must be one which is habitually, customarily, and commonly established as a reasonable incidental, accessory, subordinate and secondary use. The existing dwelling shall not be enlarged to accommodate the home occupation; nor shall any accessory structure be built for the purpose of operating the home occupation. 
6.  No home occupation shall be permitted that requires the operation or keeping on premises of a commercial vehicle. 
7.  No persons other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be employed by the home occupation. 
8.  Home occupations shall be limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. 
7.1.2. Provided full conformance with the above limitations, the types of home occupations that may be permitted shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
1.  Offices provided no customers or clients shall be allowed on premises 
2.  Phone, mail order and similar sales provided no inventory is stored on the premises and no goods are delivered on the premises by the home owner to any customers.

§7.3. - Conservation Subdivisions. 
7.3.1. Intent 
1.  To provide the flexibility to achieve the most effective development on lands that are constrained by natural hazards, environmentally sensitive areas or environmental regulations, which may limit the amount or type of development on such properties; 
2.  To enhance quality of life by promoting the creation of accessible greenspace throughout the community; 
3.  To protect sensitive, environmental land features to protect the health and safety of residents and neighboring property owners; 
4.  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation; 
5.  To encourage interaction within the community by allowing clustering of homes and orienting them closer to the street, thereby providing gathering places and encouraging the use of parks as focal points within the community; 
6.  To encourage street systems that tend to reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries; 
7.  To promote construction of convenient walking trails, bike paths, and greenways within new developments that are connected to Adjacent neighborhoods and activity centers to increase accessibility for pedestrians and bicyclists; and 
8.  To reduce perceived density by providing a maximum number of lots with direct access to and views of open space. 
7.3.2. Applicability. The Conservation Subdivision option is available as a use by right in any zoning district in which single-family detached dwellings may be permitted. The applicant shall comply with all other provisions of this Ordinance and all other applicable regulations, except those which may be modified as specified within this Section. 
7.3.3. Ownership of Development Site. The tract of land to be subdivided and/or developed may be held in single, separate, and multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common maintenance responsibility as approved by the City Attorney. 
7.3.4. Density Determination. The maximum number of lots shall be determined by the minimum lot size of the Applicable District, the minimum lot size as required by City or County Health Department standards for septic tank use (or similar density limitation where applicable), or the maximum density of the applicable district, whichever is most restrictive. Furthermore, density determination shall also take into account the amount of land necessary for internal streets and other subdivision requirements. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total acreage of the Parcel: 
1.  Bodies of open water over 5,000 sq. ft. of contiguous area; and 
2.  Wetlands, as defined by the City or by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
7.3.5. Application Requirements 
1.  Site Analysis Map Required. Concurrent with the submission of a subdivision plat, the applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map.

It is the City of Vestavia Hill's express intent that the construction of new towers be an option of last resort; to the greatest extent feasible, location of antennae on existing towers and other suitable structures should first be sought. These standards are designed to ensure the compatibility of towers with and avoid adverse impacts to nearby properties and discourage the proliferation of towers throughout the City. 
7.9.2. Applicability. All telecommunication facilities are subject to these standards and to statutory review by the Commission and council in accordance with Section 11-52-11 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended. Anything contained in this Ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, telecommunications facilities are conditional uses, which require approval by the council. 
7.9.3. Objectives. The proposed locations and design of all telecommunication facilities shall duly consider the following public health, safety and general welfare objectives: 
1.  Structural Safety. The proposed facility will comply with wind loading and other structural standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as not to endanger the health and safety of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the tower due to extreme weather conditions or other acts of God. 
2.  View Protection. The proposed facility will be designed to minimize adverse visual impacts to surrounding properties and the public right-of-way, given the topography of the proposed site and surrounding area. 
3.  Land Use Compatibility. The proposed facility will be compatible with the surrounding land uses, given the character of the use and development of the location. 
4.  Design Harmony. The proposed facility will be designed in harmony with the natural setting and the surrounding development pattern as well as to the highest industry standards. 
5.  Existing Communication Services. The proposed facility will comply with FCC and other applicable standards so as not to interfere with existing communication services in the area. 
6.  Health Effects. The proposed tower will comply with all applicable federal, state, county and City health standards so as not to cause detrimental health effects to persons in the surrounding area. 
7.9.4. Development Criteria. The Building Official and City Engineer shall review all applications for telecommunications facilities for compliance with the applicable standards and criteria listed below. These criteria are considered the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The Commission may also impose higher standards if it deems them to be necessary to further the objectives of this Section. 
1.  Co-Location. No new tower shall be established if space is structurally, technically and economically available on an existing tower, which would serve the area that, the new tower would serve. Documentation that reasonable efforts have been made by the applicant to achieve co-location shall be submitted in accordance with §7.9.4.2 below. Towers shall be designed to maximize shared use to the greatest extent possible, given the structural and technical limitations of the type of tower proposed. In any event, co-location shall be encouraged. If feasible, each tower shall, at a minimum, be designed for double its intended use for all transmitting and receiving antennae other than microwave dish antennae. 
2.  Removal of Obsolete Towers. Any tower that is no longer in use for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owners' expense. The owner shall provide the Building Official with a copy of the notice of the FCC of intent to cease operations, which shall be given ninety (90) days from the date of ceasing operations to remove the obsolete tower and accessory structures. In the case of multiple operators sharing use of single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations. 
3.  Setbacks. 
a.  Where permitted, the distance between the base of the tower, including guys, accessory facilities and property lines abutting residential districts, public parks and roads must equal twenty (20) percent of the tower height. Property lines adjacent to other uses (e.g. agricultural, industrial) shall require a setback equal to the rear yard setback established for the underlying zone. 
b.  Notwithstanding Item a above, when located within or adjacent to a residential district or dwelling, the minimum standard setback from all adjoining residential property boundaries shall be fifty (50) feet. 
c.  Site plan review by the Commission may result in reduction of the standard setbacks in exceptional cases where a hardship would result due to unusual conditions on the site or other impracticalities. However, the Commission shall not reduce the setbacks to the detriment of affected residential properties. 
4.  Appearance. 
a.  Towers shall be of a monopole type and shall maintain an exterior finish so as to reduce the visibility of the structure, unless other standards are required by the FAA. 
b.  The design of the tower shall be of a type that has the least visual impact on the surrounding area as determined by the Commission. 
c.  The design of the tower compound shall, to the greatest extent possible, maximize use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and built environment. 
5.  Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by FAA or other authority for safety purposes. Where required, the Commission shall review the available lighting alternatives to assure that lighting proposed would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. "Dual lighting" (red at night/strobe during the day) shall be preferred unless restricted by the FAA. Security lighting may be permitted in accordance with Item e: Security Devices, below. 
6.  Landscaping. 
a.  A landscaped buffer shall effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways and residential properties. 
b.  The standard buffer shall consist of a minimum eight (8) feet wide landscaped strip outside the dark vinyl coated steel security fencing of the perimeter of the compound. The buffer strip shall be planted with an attractive combination of trees, shrubs, vines and/or ground covers that can achieve the full height of the fence at maturity and enhances the outward appearance of the security fence. For sites within 1,000 feet of a residence, site review by the Commission may impose increased buffer standards to include a decay-resistant, solid wood fence, earth berms and brick or masonry walls in addition to the security fencing. All fencing and landscaping shall be maintained by the lessor/owner. 
c.  In isolated nonresidential areas, alternative landscaping methods may be accepted, such as the use of earth toned colored, vinyl-coated steel security fencing in combination with four feet of evergreen trees, shrubs, vines and/or other plantings. 
d.  In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote, agricultural or rural locations, or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived by the Commission. 
e.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers located on large, wooded lots, preservation of substantial natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. 
f.  Cellular facilities utilizing underground vaults in lieu of above ground switching gear buildings shall be exempted from any buffer requirements. 
7.  Security Devices. The facility shall be fully secured. A minimum eight (8) feet high, dark vinyl coated steel fence shall be installed around the entire perimeter of the compound (measured to the top of the fence or barbed wired, if applicable). Security fencing shall require screening in accordance with landscaping requirements, as defined above. Other security measures shall include locks and alarms. Approved barbed or razor wire and lighting of the compound shall be permitted, if deemed necessary to fully secure the tower compound. 
8.  Access. Driveways and onsite parking shall be provided to assure the operator's access to the facility for maintenance or emergency services. 
7.9.5. Application. Any application submitted for approval shall submit the following items, in addition to any other required items, to show compliance with these review standards. 
1.  Statement of Impact on Health, Safety and Welfare. A brief written statement shall address conformance with the health, safety and welfare objectives of this guideline. 
2.  Site Plan. A scaled site plan shall show the location and dimensions of all improvements, including setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, and other information necessary to determine compliance with the development criteria of these guidelines. 
3.  Rendering. A rendering of the tower, accessory facilities and compound shall depict colors, materials and treatment. If lighting or other FAA requirements for tower color is proposed, evidence of such requirement shall be submitted. 
4.  Justification for a New Tower. The applicant shall document a proposal for a new tower that the planned equipment for a proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing tower within the proposed service area. The applicant shall submit a written affidavit showing what attempts have been made to share an existing tower or that no such tower exists. 
5.  Certification of Shared Use Design. A qualified, registered engineer shall certify that the proposed tower's structural design can accommodate a minimum of two (2) shared users, in accordance with §7.9.4 Development Criteria. 
6.  As Built Survey. A qualified, registered engineer shall certify that the proposed tower is to be constructed and installed in accordance with the submitted site plan including the installation of any required buffer yard. 
7.  Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including the number and types of antennae that can be accommodated. 
8.  Mitigation measures for ice and other hazardous falling debris, including setbacks and de-icing equipment. 
7.9.6. Exceptions. Towers camouflaged to resemble woody trees or indigenous vegetation to blend in with the native landscape, and other types of concealment, shall be reviewed by the Design Review Board. Concealment techniques are design methods used to blend a wireless telecommunications facility, including any antennas thereon, unobtrusively into the existing surroundings so as to not have the appearance of a wireless telecommunications facility. Such structures shall be considered wireless telecommunications facilities and not spires, belfries, cupolas, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level for purposes of applying height limitations. Due to their height, such structures must be designed with sensitivity to elements such as building bulk, massing and architectural treatment of both the wireless telecommunications facility and surrounding development. Concealed towers on developed property must be disguised to appear as either a part of the structure housing, a principal uses, or an accessory structure that is normally associated with the principal use occupying the property. Concealed towers developed on unimproved property must be disguised to blend in with existing vegetation. 
ARTICLE 8. - PARKING REGULATIONS 

§8.1. - Off-Street Parking. 
There shall be provided, at the time of the erection of any building or at the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor area, or before conversion from one type of use or occupancy to another, permanent off-street parking in the amount specified in Table 8.1. Required parking shall be provided for each use on the site. In calculating required parking, fractions are rounded up to the next whole number; however, when multiple uses are proposed on the same site, the fractional requirement for each use is added together prior to rounding. For uses not specified, the Zoning Official shall determine required parking based on the most similar use in Table 8.1. 
8.1.1. Certification of Minimum Parking Requirements. Each application for zoning approval shall include the location, number and dimensions of off-street parking spaces, if required, and the means of access. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the Zoning Official to determine whether or not the requirements of this Article are met. The Building Permit for the use of any building, structure or land where off-street parking space is required shall be withheld by the Building Official until the provisions of this Article are fully met. 
8.1.2. Joint Use Parking Lots. Parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing the required parking facilities for any other use on the same or separate lots, except as provided herein: 
1.  Under circumstances wherein a combination of uses or other factors might require total parking facilities in excess of actual need, if so determined and certified by the Zoning Official, a commensurate reduction in parking may be approved by the Commission. Two uses, for example, may share one parking facility and the spaces provided therein when the parking demand for the uses occur at wholly separate times. Furthermore, such uses need not be located on the same lot, so long as the requirements of §8.1.3 Remote Parking are met. 
2.  Shared parking for mixed-use developments. Subject to approval by the Commission, minimum parking requirements for a mixed-use development may be reduced by calculation of shared parking requirements for the development utilizing the shared parking demand information in Table 8.1.1 and the Worksheet shown in Figure 8.1.1. These parking reductions shall not be available to lodging or residential uses unless such uses are part of a development also including non-lodging, nonresidential uses. 
Parking reductions may be allowed as part of site plan approval only if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that a combination of the following factors or measures are proposed by the development plan, including, but not limited to,: 
a.  There are no material adverse impacts on parking conditions in the immediate vicinity. 
b.  The development plan mitigates vehicular traffic impacts by proposing limited access to and from public streets. 
c.  The development plan proposes the creation of new or upgraded sidewalks to help foster non-vehicular accessibility.

Required parking spaces shall be permanently marked and maintained and shall be accessible from a driveway or aisle such that all vehicles approach the street in a forward motion. Restrictions and exceptions include: 
1.  Detached single-family dwellings and duplexes may substitute a ribbon-type driveway or an unpaved all-weather surface, in accord with standards adopted by the City Engineer, in place of a solid-paved surface. Vehicles may approach a street in either a forward or backing motion. This shall not apply to shared driveways serving multiple residences unless approved in writing by the City Engineer. 
2.  All driveways that cross an existing sidewalk shall be paved from the edge of street pavement to at least ten (10) ft from the back of the sidewalk, regardless of whether the parking on-site is required to be paved or not. See illustration at right. Ribbon-type driveways shall be solid-paved from the back of sidewalk to the edge-of-pavement. 

3.  In addition to Paragraph 2, above, all uses, whether required to provide paved parking or an unpaved all-weather surface, driveways shall be required to pave all turn-outs and portions of driveways located within any rights-of-way. 
8.2.4. Pavement Markings. The City Engineer may prescribe such traffic markers and or signs as deemed necessary to safely and efficiently manage traffic flow. Parking spaces, except those serving single-family dwellings and duplexes, shall be demarcated with painted lines and/or signs or other markings accepted by the City Engineer. Stacking spaces shall not be individually marked but instead shall be clearly demarcated to direct traffic, as necessary. 
8.2.5. Drainage. Off-street Parking facilities shall be drained to prevent damage to abutting property and streets. Landscaping areas shall be graded and designed to receive a reasonable portion of the rainfall from surrounding pavement. Openings for the flow of water shall be provided around any landscaped areas lined with protective curbing.

§9.3. - Buffers. 
Buffers shall be provided in accord with the requirements of Tables 8.3A and 8.3B and as described in this §9.3. In cases where Buffers are required or deemed necessary for the protection and/or separation of uses on abutting lots, the following provisions shall be the minimum requirements unless otherwise specified by the reviewing authority in individual cases. For the purposes of this Section, "fences" and "walls" shall have the same meaning. 
9.3.1. General Requirements. Except as otherwise provided herein, buffers shall be required based on the developing use and the existing, abutting use, regardless of the zoning districts in which they are located. 
1.  Required yards, where corresponding with the buffer area, may overlap and may be counted toward a buffer width requirement. 
2.  100 percent of the applicable buffer requirements shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, except when the developing use will abut an existing more intensive use established prior to the adoption of these standards and for which no buffer is in place. In this case, the approving authority may require up to fifty (50) percent of the required buffer width on the developing site. In such case, the applicant shall only be required to preserve existing vegetation within the buffer width or replace such vegetation with equivalent landscaping. 
3.  Any required buffer abutting a park or greenway may be reduced, if the property owner dedicates land to be set aside, for all or part of the required buffer width, to the City for incorporation into the park or greenway if approved by the council. 
4.  Buffer requirements may be modified by the approving authority for certain cases as follows: 
a.  When the proposed use will abut an existing, nonconforming use on a property that is designated for another use in the Comprehensive Plan and is zoned accordingly with said plan, the Buffer may be modified to be consistent with the projected use of the neighboring land. 
b.  If the land use relationships between two (2) abutting lots changes so that a lesser Buffer would be required, the width of the previously provided Buffer may be reduced accordingly. 
c.  If the required Buffer abuts a public alley, up to one-half (1/2) of the alley width may be counted toward the buffer width requirement but the landscaping density requirements shall not be reduced. 
d.  Whenever the proposed use abuts vacant land, buffer requirements shall be based on the zoning of the abutting property or the use projected by the Comprehensive Plan, whichever requires a lesser buffer. When determining buffer requirements based on the zoning or projected use of abutting vacant land, the Zoning Official shall consider the range of possible future uses and base the requirement on the use(s) that require a lesser buffer. 
5.  Golf courses, playfields, stables, swimming pools, tennis courts, and other recreational facilities; parking and other vehicular use areas; Buildings, dumpsters, and Outdoor Storage are prohibited in required Buffers. The approving authority may permit a pedestrian access way through a required Buffer, to allow access between the abutting uses, if desired. 
9.3.2. Design Requirements. 
1.  Trees and shrubs shall be provided in accordance with Table 9.3B. 
2.  Stormwater management and drainage controls required by the City Engineer shall be coordinated with the buffer design and integrated into the overall site design. 
3.  The required Buffer width and planting density may be reduced as provided in Table 9.3B when a buffer fence is provided that meets the following standards: 
a.  Buffer fences shall be of masonry, ornamental metal, durable wood, or a combination thereof as approved by the reviewing authority. Untreated wood, chain-link, plastic or wire shall not be permitted. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the fence surface, required as a part of a buffer, shall be left open. The finished side of the fence shall face abutting property. 
b.  Buffer fences shall be a minimum of six (6) feet high and no taller than eight (8) feet. Buffer landscaping shall be placed along the exterior side. If longer than 100 feet in one direction, the fence shall have columns of wood or masonry, spaced no greater than fifty (50) feet on center and which project outward from the fence surface.

9.3.3. Planting Requirements. The required Buffer shall be installed before a Certificate of Occupancy may be approved. Except as herein provided, plantings installed toward buffer requirements shall be in accord with the general requirements and minimum planting specifications set forth in §9.5 Planting, Installation and Maintenance. 
1.  Existing natural vegetation, which meets, in whole or in part, buffer planting requirements, may be applied toward the requirements of this Section. 
2.  Trees shall be evergreen. 
3.  Shrubs shall be evergreen and be thirty (30) inches tall at planting. However, up to twenty-five (25) percent of the required shrubs: 1) may be deciduous, b) may be two (2) feet tall when planted, provided an average height of three (3) to four (4) feet within four (4) years; and c) when planted on a berm, may be of a lesser height, provided that the combined height of the Berms and planting is at least six (6) feet after four (4) years. 
§9.4. - Screening. 
Screening is intended to provide both visual separation of conflicting uses on-site and between adjacent properties and shall be designed to be compatible with the surrounding environment and shall not dominate the view. For the purposes of this section, "fences" and "walls" shall have the same meaning. 
9.4.1. Applicability. For all multi-family, nonresidential and mixed use developments, the following shall require Screening: 
1.  Garbage collection, recycling and refuse handling areas 
2.  Maintenance areas or utility structures associated with a building or development 
3.  Water meters, gas meters, electric meters and air conditioners/mechanical units 
4.  Loading docks or spaces 
5.  Outside runs for veterinary clinics, animal shelters, and kennels 
6.  Outdoor storage of materials, stock, equipment, and vehicles (such as those stored for repair) 
7.  Any other uses for which screening may be required by the reviewing authority 
9.4.2. Safety Provisions. 
1.  Screening shall not conflict with §4.3.8 Sight Distance Requirements. 
2.  Screening shall not block access to any above-ground, pad-mounted transformer and shall provide the minimum clear distance required by the utility company. 
3.  Screening shall not impede or divert the flow of water in any drainage way. 
9.4.3. Design Requirements. The method of screening, including height and materials, shall be that which is sufficient to visually screen the use. The minimum height needed is preferred. Fences, berms, or landscaping used for other purposes, but that are proposed as part of a required screen and that meet the requirements of this Section, may count toward screening requirements. The design of screening shall be in accord with the following and as approved by the reviewing authority: 
1.  Location of uses. Location on site should be the first consideration in screening the uses listed in §9.4.1 above. The reviewing authority may lessen screening requirements when the location of the use to be screened reduces its visibility or other impact to the public and neighboring properties. 
a.  Uses requiring screening, when co-located, may be screened together. 
b.  Uses that produce objectionable noise or odors shall be located so as to minimize such impacts to the public and abutting properties. 
2.  Screening Fences. All screening fences shall comply with the following: 
a.  Screening fences shall be of masonry, ornamental metal, vinyl, durable wood, or a combination thereof. Untreated wood, chain-link, plastic or wire shall not be permitted. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the fence surface, required as part of a Screen, shall be left open. The finished side of the fence shall face abutting property. 
b.  Where screening fences are longer than fifty (50) feet in one direction, evergreen landscaping shall be placed along the exterior side. Where such fences are longer than 100 feet in one direction, required landscaping shall include both trees and shrubs and the fence shall have columns of wood or masonry which project outward from the fence surface. Such columns shall be spaced no greater than fifty (50) feet on center. 
c.  Fences located forward of the front building line shall not exceed six (6) feet. Fences located in a required rear or side yard shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height. 
3.  Berms. Berms shall be landscaped and stabilized to prevent erosion and shall be a minimum height of four (4) feet. Slopes shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
4.  Shrubs and trees. Except as herein provided, plantings installed for screening requirements shall conform to §9.5 following. 
a.  Shrubs shall be evergreen and spaced no more than five (5) feet on center. 
b.  Trees shall be evergreen and, when used in the absence of a fence, should have a low understory and/or be used together with shrubs to provide an opaque visual Screen. 
5.  Screening requirements for specific uses. 
a.  Dumpsters, trash refuse, and recycling containers shall not be located forward of the front building line. Such containers shall be screened by a combination of opaque fence or masonry wall and plant material on three (3) sides. Opaque gates, designed to complement the screen, shall be installed for access. The fence or wall shall be at least two (2) feet taller than the container. 
b.  For restaurants, enclosures shall be sized, as needed, to accommodate the storage of grease containers. 
c.  Mechanical equipment on roofs or on site shall be screened so as to not be visible from public streets or adjacent properties. The screening of building-mounted mechanical equipment shall be an integral component of the building design. Mechanical equipment installed on site shall be adequately screened by plant materials and/or fences and shall blend in with site landscaping. 
d.  Outdoor storage, where permitted, shall be screened to a height of six (6) feet or two (2) feet taller than the material or equipment to be screened, whichever is greater. 
e.  Service areas, loading docks, work yards, and similar uses should be located to minimize their visibility to the public and to any abutting properties to which such functions would be objectionable. Where their location is insufficient to effectively screen the use, required screening shall be at least six (6) feet in height. Loading berths shall be within the building or concealed by means of a screening wall of material similar to and compatible with that of the Building. 
§9.5. - Planting, Installation and Maintenance. 
9.5.1. Planting. 
1.  All plants shall be suitable for local planting conditions and the intended landscaping purpose. All required landscaping areas shall be maintained with mulch (two inches deep at installation), sod or other approved ground cover. 
2.  Native, drought-tolerant vegetation shall be used where practicable to avoid excess water consumption for irrigation. Plans submitted for review shall identify such native species. 
3.  Required plantings shall be spaced to allow for adequate growth and coverage. 
4.  Canopy trees shall have a minimum two-and-one-half (2.5) inch caliper measured six (6) inches above ground and be a minimum twelve (12) feet in height at time of planting. At time of planting, evergreen trees shall be a minimum seven (7) feet in height and multi-stemmed trees shall be eight (8) feet in height. 
5.  Shrubs shall have a minimum height of one (1) foot measured from grade level at the time of planting.

Any change, which said Official determines to be a major change, shall require a revised Landscaping Plan be resubmitted for approval. 
9.5.3. Maintenance. The Owner shall be responsible for providing, protecting, and maintaining required plantings in a healthy and growing condition. Any dead, missing, or unhealthy plants shall be replanted at the next seasonal planting opportunity, and broken or deteriorated non-living materials shall be replaced. Planted areas shall be maintained in a healthy condition. Screening fences/walls, pavers, irrigation or other improvements shall be maintained in good condition, and any such improvement shall be replaced or repaired within thirty (30) days of its demise. Failure to comply with these maintenance requirements shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the remedies and penalties provided in §13.7. 
§9.6. - Tree Preservation Regulations. 
9.6.1. These provisions are intended to regulate the removal and/or destruction of trees within the community for the purpose of:

2.  Reducing the effects of noise and air pollution; 
3.  Preventing soil erosion and the siltation of drainage improvements and waterway; 
4.  Protection and enhancing the aesthetic qualities of the community; and 
5.  Adding an element of landscape maturity to new developments in the city thereby enhancing buffering, privacy and increasing the value of property. 
9.6.2. Applicability and Exceptions. These regulations shall apply to each Protected Tree within the corporate limits of the City, except a Protected Tree on any lot zoned or used exclusively for single family (attached and/or detached) [except new residential subdivisions as defined in §9.6.5.2] and any property zoned as PUD (planned unit development). 
9.6.3. General Regulations. No Protected Tree as defined in this Section shall be removed, relocated, destroyed or otherwise directly or indirectly damaged unless and until a tree permit under this Section has first been issued. The City is authorized to issue an annual permit to public utility companies exempting them from this requirement with respect to the trimming of Protected Trees that may interfere with utility lines located within public right-of-way, upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the City. No tree permit shall be required for the incidental trimming or pruning of a Protected Tree located on private property by the owner of the property or the owner's agent. 
9.6.4. Definitions 
1.  Caliper: The measurement of the diameter of a tree trunk four (4) feet above existing grade. 
2.  Protected Tree: Any tree that has a caliper of at least six (6) inches. 
9.6.5. Tree Permit 
1.  Any person wishing to remove, relocate, destroy, or otherwise damage a Protected Tree shall, under the provisions of this subsection, make written application to the DRB, which application shall include a landscape plan as provided before in said application or other information that adequately explains the request. 
2.  As part of any request for a land disturbance permit for a new subdivision with a minimum of five (5) lots, the applicant shall include, as a part of the application, a tree save plan that will preserve as many trees in the development as practical. The plan shall be approved by the Commission as part of the preliminary plat process (or final plat process if no preliminary is required) with input and recommendations from the City Engineer, the Department of Building Safety and the Vestavia Hills Tree Commission. Once approval of the tree save plan has been secured along with all other requirements concerning a land disturbance permit, the City Engineer may issue a land disturbance permit for said subdivision; or 
3.  Application fees for the filing of tree permit requests shall be in accordance with City of Vestavia Hills Schedule of Fees unless it can be demonstrated to the Department of Building Safety that said tree is/has been damaged, diseased, or in danger of falling close to existing or proposed structures. 
4.  In the case of tree removal or relocation activities that will be required on a continuing or repetitive basis, the City may issue a blanket tree permit on such terms and for such duration as are determined to be appropriate under the circumstances. Completed applications shall be filed with the Committee a minimum of 15 days prior to the regular scheduled meeting and shall contain the signature of the property owner or a notarized letter assigning an agent to represent signed by the owner. 
5.  The DRB will consider approval or denial of the application at the next regularly scheduled meeting following proper filing of the completed application. If approved, a tree permit shall be issued by the Department of Building Safety authorizing the proposed activity. 
6.  The mayor may declare an emergency and impose a temporary moratorium on the enforcement of this requirement, following severe storm events within the city. 
9.6.6. Criteria for Issuance of a Tree Permit 
1.  A Tree Permit for the requested activity shall be issued if: 
a.  The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement is to be placed according to a site plan or building permit approved by the City; or 
b.  The tree is diseased, damaged, in danger of falling close to existing or proposed structures (approved in A. above), interferes with existing or proposed essential utility services, creates unsafe vision clearance or conflicts with other ordinances or regulations of the City; or 
c.  Removal of the tree will not result in any adverse material affect to the appearance of the site, since other Protected Trees of similar age, height, and species are present on the site and/or a sufficient number of replacement trees are proposed to be planted on the site in appropriate locations and of sufficient size to prevent such adverse affect. 
d.  The tree is to be removed and relocated as part of (1) the bona fide harvesting or thinning of timber from land currently assessed and managed as forest property; (2) the bona fide thinning of growth from undeveloped property for the purpose of the maintenance of the overall health of the trees and growth on such property; (3) the release from nursery inventory of trees commercially cultivated for the purpose of resale; or (4) the preservation of such tree in connection with the expansion of agricultural operations in the vicinity of such tree. 
2.  If, in the determination of the DRB that the application does not meet the above criteria, it will be denied and the reasons communicated to the applicant who may appeal the decision to the Commission within ten (10) working days by filing a written request with the City Clerk in a format or on a form as specified by the department. 
9.6.7. Enforcement and Penalties. Whenever the Building Official shall determine that a violation of this Section has occurred, any of the following actions may be initiated singly or in combination: 
1.  On any new construction site, a stop work order may be immediately issued to the contractor or property owner. Upon receipt of such order, construction may not be resumed until an approved plan authorizing the removal of the subject trees is presented to the DRB or a remediation proposal is presented to the Chairman and approved by the DRB as provided in subsection (3) below. 
2.  On an existing developed site, depending upon the circumstances of the violation, a formal citation may be issued to the violator as determined by the Building Official. A stop work order shall specify the nature of the violation and require that any work not permitted under this Article immediately cease and desist. The property owner shall, within, two (2) weeks, present a remediation proposal to the City for correcting the violation. 
3.  Each remediation proposal shall be reviewed by the Building Official, who shall present the proposal to the DRB along with a recommendation for acceptance or rejection, or modification thereof. 
4.  Any person violating any of the provisions of this Section shall be guilty of an offense against the City and shall, upon conviction, be punished for each violation as provided in §13.7 Remedies and Penalties for Violation. Each Protected Tree removed, relocated, destroyed, or otherwise damaged without a Tree Permit shall constitute a separate violation. 
5.  These regulations shall not be construed to impair: (1) the right of eminent domain granted by State laws to utilities, whether public or private, or (2) their right to design, locate, erect, construct, re-construct, alter, protect or maintain utility poles, towers, lines, conduits, pipes or mains reasonably required in the public service or (3) their right to exercise authority conferred by statute, franchise, certificate of convenience and necessity, license or easement. Maintenance, repair, and extension of any public and private utility lines or related infrastructure are expressly allowed. The preceding will apply to work done by the utility's employees, agents and contractors doing work for the utility.

b.  The permanently-affixed copy area shall not exceed an area equal to twenty-five (25) percent of the surface area of the detached canopy, which surface area shall not be counted as part of the sign area. 
11.5.3. Attached Signs. Each establishment shall be allowed attached signage on each facade or on any elevation that faces a public parking lot or a parking lot directly associated with the establishment. No more than two forms of attached signage (i.e., one wall sign and one awning sign) shall be permitted on one elevation, subject to the maximum attached sign area permitted on any one elevation. Attached sign copy area, including the maximum aggregate copy area for attached signage permitted on multiple elevations, shall be as described in Table 11.5.3 and as provided in Paragraphs 1 and 2 following. 
1.  For attached signs placed less than 250 feet from the nearest thoroughfare right-of-way: Where an establishment, per this Section, may be permitted attached signage on more than one elevation, the aggregate, attached sign copy area on each elevation shall not exceed the area specified in Row 1. Each such establishment is permitted an aggregate copy area for all permitted attached signs as specified in ROW 2. 
For example, if an establishment with a GFA of 2,500 sq. ft. is permitted attached signage on each of two elevations, the amount in Row 2 (40 sq. ft.) is multiplied by "2" to determine how much copy area may be distributed among the two permitted attached sign locations.

2.  For attached signs placed 250 feet or more from the nearest thoroughfare right-of-way: Where an establishment, per this Section, may be permitted attached signage on more than one elevation, the aggregate, attached sign copy area on each elevation shall not exceed the area specified in Row 3. Each such establishment is permitted an aggregate copy area for all permitted attached signs as specified in Row 4. 
For example, if an establishment with a GFA of 2,500 sq. ft. is permitted attached signage on each of two elevations, all of which are 250 feet or more from the nearest thoroughfare right-of-way, the amount in Row 4 (48 sq. ft.) is multiplied by "2" to determine how much copy area may be distributed among the two permitted attached sign locations. A total of 96 sq. ft. of attached sign copy area would be permitted with no individual sign being larger than 60 sq. ft. 
3.  Wall Signs. Where permitted, wall signs shall not extend out from the face of the building more than 18 inches.

The Board of Zoning Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the "BZA", as prescribed by Code of Alabama, 1975, Section 11-52-80, as amended, shall have the following powers and authority. 
§12.2. - Administrative Review. 
The BZA shall have hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that an error exists in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this Ordinance, in accordance with the following. 
12.2.1. All appeals shall be filed in writing on forms prescribed by the Board and made available by the Zoning Official. Any such appeal shall be filed with the Zoning Official within fifteen (15) days of the date of the action being appealed. The Zoning Official shall forthwith transmit to the BZA papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken. 
12.2.2. In exercising the power of administrative review the BZA must apply, not vary, the terms of the Ordinance. 
12.2.3. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed therefrom, unless the Zoning Official certifies to the BZA after the notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts cited in such certification a stay would, in the Zoning Official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the BZA or by a court of record. 
12.2.4. The BZA shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal. Notice shall be provided in accordance with §12.7 Notice Requirement. 
12.2.5. The BZA may affirm, reverse wholly or in part, or modify the Zoning Official's decision, order, or determination as in its opinion ought to be done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning Official. 
Furthermore, the BZA may classify a use, which is not specifically mentioned, along with a comparable permitted use for purpose of the use regulations of any Zoning District. 
§12.3. - Special Exceptions. 
The BZA shall hear and decide requests for approval of Special Exceptions uses in accordance with the following: 
12.3.1. Special Exception uses shall require the submission of an application to the BZA. Such application shall be filed with the Zoning Official at least thirty (30) days before the scheduled hearing date before the BZA. The application shall be filed by the property owner or their authorized agent on a form made available by the Zoning Official. Notice shall be provided fifteen (15) days in advance and as otherwise in accordance with §12.7 Notice Requirement. 
12.3.2. The BZA shall review the application for compliance with this Ordinance and all other applicable codes and ordinances of the City. In particular the BZA shall determine that satisfactory provisions have been made concerning the following, among other considerations of this Ordinance: 
1.  Access to and from the property and the proposed structure and/or uses, with particular attention to vehicular and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and emergency access. 
2.  The location and accessibility of off-street parking and loading areas. 
3.  The location and accessibility of refuse and service areas and their potentially adverse affects upon surrounding properties. 
4.  The screening and buffering of potentially adverse views and activities from surrounding properties. 
5.  Control of noise, glare, odor, surface water runoff, and other potentially disturbing impacts upon surrounding properties. 
6.  The availability, location, and capacity of utilities. 
7.  The location and scale of signs and lighting with particular reference to traffic safety, glare, and visual compatibility with surrounding properties. 
8.  The bulk, density, and lot coverage of structures, and yards and open areas, with reference to their compatibility with the character of the surrounding area. 
12.3.3. The Board may impose such conditions for approval that it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance in relation to the items listed above and as may otherwise be reasonably necessary. Such conditions shall apply to the land, structure, and use for which the Special Exception is granted and not to a particular person. Violations of conditions lawfully attached to any Special Exception shall be deemed to be violations of this Ordinance. 
12.3.4. A Special Exception granted by the BZA shall lapse and be of no effect if, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of such action by the BZA, no construction or change in use pursuant to such Special Exception has taken place, provided that the BZA may, for good cause shown, specify a longer period of time in conjunction with its action to grant the Special Exception. 
§12.4. - Variances. 
The BZA may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the BZA that the conditions outlined below do, in fact, exist. In no case shall the BZA grant a variance that permits the permanent use of land, building or structure for a use prohibited within the district in which the land, building or structure is located. Nor shall the BZA grant a variance, which permits the extension or addition of a non-conforming use or in any way makes a non-conforming use more permanent. 
It is the intent of this Ordinance that variances be used only to overcome some physical condition of a parcel of land, which poses a practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner from using it in conformance with this Ordinance. Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. 
12.4.1. Procedure. Applications shall be filed with the Zoning Official at least thirty (30) days before the scheduled hearing date before the BZA. The property owner or authorized agent shall file the application on a form made available by the Zoning Official. Notice shall be provided fifteen (15) days in advance and otherwise in accordance with §12.7 Notice Requirement. 
12.4.2. Before any variance is granted, the BZA must find that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions, which are peculiar to the piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography, that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
2.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other owners of property in the District in which the property is located. 
3.  All literal interpretations of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other owners of property in the district in which the property is located. 
4.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
5.  The special circumstances are not the intended result of the actions of the applicant (i.e., self-imposed hardship) 
6.  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
7.  That no non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted or non-conforming use of lands, structures, or building in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
8.  That the variance will not allow the permanent establishment of a use not permissible under the terms of this Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Ordinance in said district. 
12.4.3. In proving that an unnecessary hardship has been imposed on the property as a result of the strict interpretation of this Ordinance, the following conditions cannot be considered pertinent to the determination of whether or not an unnecessary hardship exists. 
1.  Proof that a variance would increase the financial return from the land 
2.  Personal or economic hardship 
3.  Self-imposed hardship 
In other words, hardship alone is not sufficient to permit variance. It must be an "unnecessary hardship". Mere financial loss of a kind, which might be common to all of the property owners in a district, is not an "unnecessary hardship". 
12.4.4. A Variance granted by the BZA shall lapse and be of no effect if, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of such action by the BZA, no construction pursuant to such Variance has taken place, provided that the BZA may, for good cause shown, specify a longer period of time in conjunction with its action to grant the Variance. 
§12.5. - Abatement Order. 
The BZA may require the conduct of any use, conforming or non-conforming, which results in unreasonable noise, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, fire, radio interference or explosion hazard or nuisance to surrounding property to be modified or changed to abate such hazard to health, comfort, and convenience. The BZA may direct the Building Official to issue an abatement order, but such order may be directed only after a public hearing by the said Board, notice of which shall be sent by registered mail to the owners and/or operators of the property in which the use is conducted in addition to due notice by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation. A hearing to consider issuance of an abatement order shall be held by the BZA either upon petition signed by a person affected by the hazard or nuisance and such order shall specify the date by which the hazard or nuisance shall be abated. 
§12.6. - Rehearings. 
12.6.1. All decisions rendered by the BZA shall be final and binding upon all parties. No appeal of an administrative decision, or decision on an application for a variance or a special exception shall be reheard, and no further application shall be accepted once a decision has been rendered except under one or more of the following conditions: 
1.  New evidence or information pertinent to the request has been discovered which was not available to the applicant at the time of the original hearing. 
2.  The decision resulted from an error in procedures required by this Ordinance or State law and made by the BZA, the Zoning Official, or any other City Officials. 
3.  The decision resulted from an error in substantive law under the provisions of this Ordinance or the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended. 
12.6.2. Where no error is alleged and no new evidence is available, a new or more effective presentation by the applicant shall not constitute grounds for rehearing a decision of the BZA. Any applicant wishing a rehearing shall appear before the BZA to present one or more of the qualifying conditions listed in this Section. 
12.6.3. If the BZA finds that one or more of the qualifying conditions exist, the applicant may submit a new application. This new application shall be heard at a subsequent BZA meeting, and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements. Allowing a new application does not obligate the BZA to grant the request. 
§12.7. - Notice Requirement. 
The BZA shall not grant any variance, exception or conduct any other public hearing regarding any other request without first giving written notice a minimum of fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed date of such public hearing to all owners of property located adjacent or contiguous to the boundaries of the property which is subject to the requested variance, exception or other business, as shown by the records of the office of the Tax Assessor of the applicable County on a date not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such notice. Such notice shall state the street address of the property, if any, which is the subject of the proposed variance, exception or other request to such proposal and that the said property owner is welcome to attend the public hearing and invited to speak on the issue if he or she so desires. Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, certified mail-return receipt requested, first class postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as shown on the records of the office of the Tax Assessor of the applicable County on the date such owners are determined. Any error in the address of any notice shall not invalidate the giving of notice, provided that no more than five (5) percent of the total number of notices given with respect to the applicable hearing contain any such error. 
§12.8. - Appeals from Action of the Board of Adjustment. 
Any party aggrieved by any final judgment or decision of the BZA may, within fifteen (15) days thereafter appeal there from to the circuit court or court of like jurisdiction, by filing with the BZA a written notice of appeal specifying the judgment or decision from which appeal is taken. In case of such appeal, the BZA shall cause a transcript of the proceedings in the case to be certified to the court to which the appeal is taken and the cause in such court shall be tried de novo. 
Service of a notice of appeal on the City Clerk by an aggrieved party within the fifteen (15) day appeal time constitutes service on the BZA.

13.4.1. Petition to Amend. Petitions to amend this Ordinance with respect to rezoning land may be initiated only upon filing of an application with the Commission by the owner of the land or the owner's authorized agent, in which case a notarized letter is required. Any member of the council may initiate the rezoning of any land by introduction of a resolution for such purpose. An application for any change of zoning shall be filed in the office of the Commission at least twenty-five (25) working days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission. The petition shall state the nature of the proposed amendment, and a legal description of the property involved and the names and addresses of the owner(s) of the property.

13.4.2. Action on Petition. The Commission shall consider the petition at the first regularly scheduled meeting following the proper filing of the petition. The Commission shall, after the public hearing, make recommendations to the council. The recommendations of the Commission shall be advisory only, and shall not be binding on the council. No amendment to the Ordinance shall become effective unless it has been submitted to the Commission for a recommendation. 
13.4.3. Notice of Public Hearing. Notice of a public hearing to consider a change in zoning classification must be given to the public as required by Act 1123 of the 1973 Legislature of the State of Alabama and those requirements set forth in the Code of Alabama, 1975. No changes or amendments in the provisions of this Ordinance shall become effective until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard, in accordance with the following. 
1.  Petitioner shall furnish City Clerk with names and addresses of owners of record of property within 500 feet, as shown in the records of the Applicable County Tax Assessor. 
2.  For the purposes of this §13.4.3, the phrase "change in zoning classification" shall include, without limitation, any change, modification or amendment of zoning district boundaries. 
3.  The Commission shall not conduct any public hearing proposing the recommendation for change in the zoning classification of any property within the City without first giving written notice a minimum of fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed date of the public hearing, to all owners of property located in whole or in part within 500 feet from the boundaries of the property which is the subject of the proposed change in zoning classification, as shown by the records of the office of the applicable County Tax Assessor. 
4.  The council shall not enact any change in the zoning classification of any property subject to the zoning jurisdiction of the City without first giving written notice a minimum of fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed date of such enactment to all owners of property located in whole or in part within 500 feet from the boundaries of the property which is the subject of the proposed change in zoning classification, as shown by the records of the office of the applicable County Tax Assessor on a date not more than one year prior to the date of such notice.

Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage prepaid, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as shown on the records of the office of the applicable County Tax Assessor on the date of such owners are determined. Any error in the address of any such notice shall not invalidate the giving of notice pursuant to this Ordinance, provided that no more than five (5) percent of the total number of notices given with respect to any proposed change in zoning classification contain any such error. 
5.  For purposes of this Ordinance, the term "written notice by United States mail" shall mean "certified mail-return receipt requested".

After the council has voted on an application for rezoning, another application for the same kind of rezoning of the same tract or parcel of land, or change of the same portion of the Zoning Ordinance will not be considered until a period of one (1) year has elapsed from the date of such action by the council. Further, a withdrawal of the application for rezoning after hearing held by the Commission, but prior to the hearing by the council shall also require a one (1) year period of time before another application may be submitted. Provided, however that the Commission and/or council may adjust this time period if in the opinion of a majority of the Commission and/or council, an unusual situation or circumstance exists which would warrant another hearing. In other words, the Commission and council have the discretion to hear rezoning requests at any time when it is determined by the said Commission and/or council that it will promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare to do so or that there are other justifiable reasons for warranting such rezoning hearing. 
13.4.5. Procedures for Creation of Certain Residential Zoning Districts. 
1.

§13.5. - Zoning of Annexed Property. 
13.5.1. Annexed Property. All territory annexed to the City of Vestavia Hills, Alabama shall be subject to the laws, rules, regulations and ordinances of the said City. All territory annexed to the City shall be zoned in accordance with the following procedure. 
13.5.2. Jurisdiction over Annexed Property. All territory brought within the corporate limited of the City by annexation shall be subject to the laws, rules, regulations and ordinances of the City, including specifically but not limited to the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations and the City Building Code. The council shall have and exercise the authority over the territory within the corporate limits of the City. 
13.5.3. Authority. Pursuant to the authority vested in the City by the provisions of Title 11-52-70, et seq., Code of Alabama, 1975, the council shall zone all property annexed to the corporate limits of the City. 
13.5.4. Intents and Purpose. In accordance with the provisions of Act Number 300 of the 1955 session of the Alabama Legislature, (Code of Alabama Recompiled, 1958, Appendix Section 985, Volume 14 at page 397), the council intends to zone and regulate annexed territory as to the kind, character and use and structures and improvements. It is the intent of the council that all real property located within the municipal boundaries shall be governed by the laws, rules, regulations and ordinances of the City rather than by those of the County. 
The City follows the annexation procedure outlined in Act Number 32 of the 1964 session of the Alabama legislature to extend the corporate limits. Said act requires that the municipality shall hold a public hearing to determine the truth of the matters set forth in the Petition for annexation and consider any written protests or objections regarding the proposed annexation. The public hearing on the annexation petition must not be less than ninety (90) days from the date of publication. It is the intent of the council to conduct a public hearing on the zoning of the annexed territory immediately following the public hearing on the annexation petition. An ordinance zoning the annexed territory shall be adopted immediately after enactment of the ordinance annexing said property. The terms of this Ordinance however, shall not preclude or prohibit the City from extending its corporate limits in any other way or manner that may now or hereafter be authorized by Alabama Law. 
13.5.5. Zoning Classification. 
1.  The application to zone or rezone the property sought to be annexed shall be initiated by the property owner or the owner's authorized agent by filing a petition concurrently with the petition for annexation. Any member of the council may also initiate the rezoning of said territory by introduction of resolution for such purposes. The zoning classification to be applied for shall be that Vestavia Hills classification closest to and most compatible with the applicable County classification in effect on the property at the time of filing the petition for annexation except as provided in Paragraph 2 immediately below. Should two different City zoning classifications be close to and compatible with the County classification, then the City classification imposing greater restrictions shall be applied for. 
2.  A petitioner may request rezoning to a City zoning classification not otherwise compatible with the County zoning classification in effect on the concerned property. In such case, the request shall be considered according to the procedure set forth in §13.4 Amendments. If the request is denied, the council shall have the authority to classify the property in accordance with Paragraph 1 above. In any case, the property, upon annexation, shall be rezoned to a City zoning classification. 
13.5.6. Notice Requirements. Notice shall be in accordance with §13.4.3 Notice of Public Hearing for other zoning amendments. 
§13.6. - Temporary Emergency Relief. 
The Zoning Official upon approval by the council is hereby granted authority to provide immediate emergency relief to applicants requesting such relief by issuing permits authorizing installation of mobile homes on applicant's property under the following conditions: 
13.6.1. Such permit shall be temporary and not exceed one (1) year from date of issuance. 
13.6.2. Such permit shall not be transferable. 
13.6.3. Prior to issuance of such permit, the Zoning Official shall, with discretion, be reasonably satisfied that the applicant's requested relief is necessary and the need thereof was approximately caused by damage resulting from fire or natural disasters. 
§13.7. - Remedies and Penalties for Violation. 
It shall be unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, maintain, use or occupy any land in violation of any regulation in, or any provision of this Ordinance, or any amendment thereof, enacted or adopted under the authority of this Act. Any person, firm or corporation violating any such regulation, provision or amendment shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished in accordance with Title 11-45-9, Code of Alabama, for a misdemeanor violation for each such offense. Each and every day during which such illegal erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, use or occupancy continues shall be deemed a separate offense. Provided, however, that prior to any criminal prosecution the Zoning or Building Official or his agent shall give a written notice or citation to the person, firm or corporation violating any provision of this Ordinance stating the rule or regulation being violated and notifying the said person, firm or corporation to cease and desist such violation immediately, otherwise said person will be prosecuted as provided herein. In case any building or structure is, or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, maintained, used or occupied in violation of any regulation or provision of this Ordinance or amendment thereof, enacted or adopted by the City, said Official or any other appropriate authority or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be specifically damaged by such violation, may, in addition to other remedies provided by law, institute injunction, mandamus, abatement or any other appropriate action or actions, proceeding or proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, use or occupancy. 
The Zoning or Building Official may intervene in any action, suit or other proceedings wherein there is involved any amendment thereof, enacted or adopted by the City. When said Official so intervenes hereunder, that official shall be deemed to be, and shall be treated as an original party to the action, suit or proceedings. It is the intent of this Section that any action, suit or proceedings in which the Zoning or Building Official intervenes shall proceed the same as if that Official has been an original party, insofar as any statute, act or rule prohibiting an entire change in parties is concerned. The provisions of this Section shall apply to any action, suit or proceedings pending at the time of its adoption. 
§13.8. - Certificate of Occupancy Required. 
No land or building or other structure or part thereof hereafter erected, moved or altered in its use shall be used until the Building Official, after approval of the Fire Marshal, shall have issued a Certificate of Occupancy stating that such land or structure or part thereof is found to be in conformity with provisions of this Ordinance. 
Within five (5) working days after the owner or his agent has notified the Building Official that a building or premises or part thereof is ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the Building Official to make a final inspection thereof, and to issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the building or premises or part thereof is found to conform with the provisions of this Ordinance or, if such Certificate is refused, to state the refusal in writing with the cause.
