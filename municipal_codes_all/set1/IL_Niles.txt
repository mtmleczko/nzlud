PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Niles, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code, as supplemented through December 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. The holder of this publication will be responsible for securing all revisions from the village at the appropriate rate in effect as per section 1-3 of this Code. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of John Rigby, Supervising Editor, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Richard Troy, Village Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Secs. 34-42-34-99. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION 

Sec. 34-100. - Purpose. 
    The Village President and Board of Trustees, having found and determined that a considerable portion of the village's rental housing may be converted to condominium status, that the prospective purchasers of these condominium units are often without knowledge of the unique concepts of ownership involved, that prospective buyers often have little factual basis presented to them on which to make a decision and that, in order to provide buyers of condominium units with basic information by which to make an intelligent housing choice and promote the health, safety and welfare of the people, it is necessary and appropriate that developers of condominium conversions prepare and distribute information deemed relevant to the buyers of this type of residential property. In addition, conversions may significantly affect the balance between rental and ownership housing within the village, and thereby reduce the variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price, and location of housing; increase overall rents; decrease the supply of rental housing for all income groups; displace individuals and families; and disregard the needs of the prevailing consumer market and careful consideration must apply in granting the zoning requirement of a special use in approving any conversion. 
(Ord. No. 2006-54, § 1, 11-28-06) 
Sec. 34-101. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply only to residential conversion condominiums, as that term is herein defined, within the village. 
    Preliminary applications. Applicants may submit preliminary applications for condominium conversions of residential structures to condominiums. Such applications shall identify the owner or authorized agent, the location and number of units in the building to be converted, and contain information on the vacancy rate of multifamily dwellings of three or more units within the city and the number of tenants residing in the building(s) to be converted who support such a conversion. Please refer to Appendix D for all related fees. 
(Ord. No. 2006-54, § 1, 11-28-06; Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 2-28-12) 
Sec. 34-102. - Requirements. 
    In addition to the applicable requirements and procedures set forth in section 34-100, conversions of existing structure other than rental housing to condominiums shall be subject to the additional requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2006-54, § 1, 11-28-06) 
Sec. 34-103. - Notice of condominium conversion. 
(a)  No less than 120 days prior to the recording of the declaration pursuant to the Illinois Condominium Property Act, the developer shall give written notice to each tenant of any building being converted, of the intent to submit the property to the Act. 
Any developer of a conversion condominium must, upon issuing the notice of intent, publish and deliver along with such notice of intent, a schedule of selling prices for all units subject to the condominium instruments and offer to sell such unit to the current tenants, except for units to be vacated for rehabilitation subsequent to such notice of intent. Such offer shall not expire earlier than 30 days after receipt of the offer by the current tenant, unless the tenant notifies the developer, in writing, of his election not to purchase the condominium unit. 
(b)  For a period of 120 days following his receipt of the notice of intent (180 days for the elderly or handicapped), any tenant who was a tenant on the date the notice of intent was given shall be given the right to purchase his unit on substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in a duly executed contract to purchase the unit, which contract shall conspicuously disclose the existence of, and shall be subject to, the right of first refusal. The tenant may exercise the right of first refusal by giving notice thereof to the developer prior to the expiration of 30 days from the giving of notice by the developer to the tenant of the execution of the contract to purchase the unit. The recording of the deed conveying the unit to the purchaser which contains a statement to the effect that the tenant of the unit either waived or failed to exercise the right of first refusal or had no right of first refusal with respect to the unit shall extinguish any legal or equitable right or interest to the possession or acquisition of the unit which the tenant may have or claim with respect to the unit arising out of the right of first refusal provided for in this section. The foregoing provision shall not affect any claim which the tenant may have against the landlord for damages arising out of the right of first refusal provided for in this section. 
(c)  Any tenant who has a tenant as of the date of the notice of intent and whose tenancy expires (other than for cause) prior to the expiration of 120 days (180 days for the elderly or handicapped) from the date on which a copy of the notice of intent was given to the tenant, shall have the right to extend his tenancy on the same terms and conditions and for the same rental until the expiration of such 120- or 180-day period, as appropriate, by the giving of written notice thereof to the developer within 30 days of the date upon which a copy of the notice of intent was given to the tenant by the developer. 
Each tenant in a condominium conversion shall be informed by the developer at the time the notice of intent is given whether his tenancy will be renewed or terminated upon its expiration. If the tenancy is to be reviewed, the tenant shall be informed of all charges, rental or otherwise, in connection with the new tenancy and the length of the term of occupancy proposed in conjunction with the new tenancy and the length of the term of occupancy proposed in conjunction therewith. 
(d)  Notwithstanding lease provisions to the contrary, the tenant's premises will not be shown to prospective purchasers without the tenant's permission until the expiration of the tenant's option to purchase or 90 days prior to the end of the term of the tenant's lease, whichever is later. 
(e)  No lease or other agreement for the rental of property shall contain any provision which authorizes the lessor to terminate the lease less than 120 days (180 days for the elderly or handicapped) from notice of intent to convert as a part of any operation or transaction incident to such a conversion. No such provision of any lease or other agreement entered into after the effective day hereof shall be given any force or effect, and such provisions are declared to be void. 
(f)  Any notice provided for in this section shall be deemed given when a written notice is delivered in person or mailed, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the party who is being given the notice.

    This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this village by sections 1-2-1, 11-12-12, 11-30-8, and 11-31-2 of the State Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-8, and 5/11-31-2), as amended. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain this village's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources. This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific purposes: 
(1)  To meet the requirements of the Rivers, Lakes, and Streams Act (615 ILCS 5/18(g); 
(2)  To ensure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(3)  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage; 
(4)  To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding; 
(5)  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations; 
(6)  To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program; 
(7)  To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended; 
(8)  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(9)  To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats; and 
(10)  To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development.

    Substantial improvement means a reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a structure taking place during a ten-year period in which the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started. Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or 
(2)  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Transition section means reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a narrow cross section to a wide cross section or vice versa. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be full in compliance with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 50-41. - Enforcement by Public Works Department. 
(a)  The Public works Department shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 50-42. To fulfill those duties, the Public works Department first should use the criteria listed in section 50-56, base flood elevations, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the Public Works Department must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain on which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the Public Works Department shall require that the minimum requirements of section 50-58 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Public Works Department shall require that the minimum requirements of section 50-60 be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the Public Works Department shall require that the minimum requirements of section 50-60 be met. 
(b)  In addition, the general requirements of section 50-61 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of sections 50-58, 50-59 or 50-60. The Public Works Department shall ensure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of section 50-61. 
(c)  If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Public Works Department shall review the requirements of section 50-62 to make sure they are met. In addition, the Public Works Department shall complete all notification requirements. 
(d)  In order to ensure that property owners obtain permits as required in this article, the Public Works Department may take any and all actions as outlined in section 50-28. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 1, 6-25-08; Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 9-25-18) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, adopted Sept. 25, 2018, changed the title of § 50-41 from "Enforcement by public services department" to read as herein set out. 
Sec. 50-42. - Duties of enforcement officials. 
    The Public Works Department shall be responsible for the general administration and enforcement of this article which shall include the following: 
(1)  Determining floodplain designation. Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA). If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or a floodplain on which a detailed study has been conducted which drains more than one square mile. 
(2)  [Extended SFHA.] Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage are less than one square mile), indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this article. 
(3)  Professional engineer review. If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted which drains more than one square mile, then the permit shall be referred to a registered professional engineer (PE) under the employ or contract of the village for review to ensure that the development meets the requirements of section 50-60. In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of section 50-60. 
(4)  Dam safety requirements. Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential in the event of failure. The construction or major modification of all class I (high hazard) and class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit. Some class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off-channel detention basins that have an embankment are non-jurisdictional class III dams. It is not required that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all non-jurisdictional class III dams. 
A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is required. A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. 
(5)  Other permit requirements. Ensure that any and all required federal, state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit. 
(6)  Plan review and permit issuance. Ensure that all development activities within the SFHA's of the jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this chapter and issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this article and other regulations of this community when the development meets the conditions of this article. 
(7)  Inspection review. Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure that they comply with the provisions of this article and schedule, on an annual basis, an inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection. 
(8)  [Damage determinations.] Make damage determinations of all damaged buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged structures which must comply with chapters 18 and 50. 
(9)  Elevation and floodproofing certificates. Maintain in the permit files an elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement, of a residential or nonresidential building or the elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings, subject to section 50-61 for public inspection and provide copies of the certificate. 
(10)  Records for public inspection. Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and as-built elevation and floodproofing or elevation and floodproofing certificates for all buildings constructed subject to this article. 
(11)  State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects, subject to section 50-60, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the village. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR. 
a.  Organizations which are exempt from this article, as per the Illinois Compiled Statutes; 
b.  IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures and all other state, federal or local unit of government projects, including projects of the village and county, except for those projects meeting the requirements of section 50-59; 
c.  An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, per section 50-59; 
d.  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to section 50-59; 
e.  Alternate transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as indicated in section 50-59; 
f.  Permit issuance of structures within or over publicly navigable rivers, lakes and streams; 
g.  Any changes in the base flood elevation or floodway locations; and 
h.  Base flood elevation determinations where none now exist. 
(13)  Cooperation with other agencies. Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this article. Submit data to IDNR/OWR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for proposed revisions of a regulatory map. Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program. Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of any proposed amendments to this article. 
(14)  Promulgate regulations. Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this article, subject, however, to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any ordinance changes.

Sec. 50-43. - Flood Control Assistance Program. 
    The Community Development Department in conjunction with the Public Works Department offers this program to eligible homeowners who currently occupy single-family and multi-family homes. This program offers financial assistance to homeowners who have a need for Sewer Backflow Protection or Overland Flood Protection. The Village reserves the right to modify this administrative program as well as policies, procedures and rules adopted under the program as a result of the information and experience compiled throughout the program, including but not limited termination of the program.

DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 50-56. - Base flood elevation. 
    This article's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for the Village of Niles. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the state water survey's floodplain information repository. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA. 
(1)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of the North Branch of the Chicago River shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(2)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within one and one-half mile extraterritorial jurisdiction, or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(3)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an AH zone or A0 zone shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the village. 
(4)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an A zone on the flood insurance rate map of the village shall be according to the best existing data available. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists for a riverine SFHA it shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-11, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-1 TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the analyses of this section shall be submitted to DWR for approval. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the state water survey. For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile) which has been identified by the Public Works Department pursuant to section 50-42(2), the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in this section. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 1, 6-25-08; Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 3-22-11; Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 9-25-18) 
Sec. 50-57. - Occupation and use of flood fringe areas. 
    Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage and other provisions of this article are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the following requirement, along with the requirements of section 50-61: 
(1)  Development permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the Public Works Department. 
a.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Public Works Department. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement, and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 50-61. 
b.  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Public Works Department shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the provisions of this article. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
c.  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance. 
d.  The Public Works Department shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant, copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The Public Works Department shall not issue a permit unless all other local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(2)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
a.  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
b.  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 1, 6-25-08; Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 9-25-18) 
Sec. 50-58. - Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE). 
    A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The Public Works Department shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsection. 
(1)  Compensatory storage shall be provided per section 50-58(2)b. 
(2)  The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE). 
(3)  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the Public Works Department may waive the ten-foot minimum setback if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the Public Works Department for review. The Public Works Department may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
(4)  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the Public Works Department may waive the 20-foot minimum setback distance if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
(5)  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes. 
(6)  The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction. 
(7)  All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions. 
(8)  The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five feet below the BFE. 
(9)  There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one-quarter horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure. 
(10)  The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow. 
(11)  All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
(12)  If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the Public Works Department may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonable safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the bill being prepared by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer. 
(13)  In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

4.  An analysis of the impacts of the proposed project, considering cumulative effects on the physical and biological conditions of the body of water affected. 
The Public Works Department shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits and approvals that may be required for this type of activity. The Public Works Department shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. A registered professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section. 
(2)  Preventing increased damages; list of appropriate uses. The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
a.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
b.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses. 
c.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls. 
d.  Underground and overhead utilities. 
e.  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing, at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction, built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four-stall maximum) that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage. 
f.  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage. 
g.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification hereto. 
h.  Parking built at or below existing grade where either the depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot or the applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
i.  Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive non-erosive slope toward a watercourse. 
j.  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
k.  The replacement, reconstruction or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50 percent or more of the market value of the building before the damaged occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
l.  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to 50 percent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
(3)  Construction of appropriate uses. Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible, provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 50-61: 
a.  Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
1.  Designated floodway conveyance: 
"K" = (1,486) 2/3 n AR  
where the letter "n" is Manning's roughness factor, the letter "A" is the effective area of the cross section, and the letter "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.) 
2.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed condition unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can ensure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
3.  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
i.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
ii.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
iii.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
iv.  Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
v.  All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
b.  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and one-half times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at the existing structure. 
c.  Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase storm erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures. 
d.  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver. 
1.  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 50-56. Culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models. 
2.  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection (3)b. of this section. 
3.  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (3)c. of this section. 
4.  If the crossing is proposed over public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, IDNR/OWR permit must be received. 
5.  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed designated profile must be submitted to the IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this section. 
6.  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection (3)h. of this section. 
e.  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and approach roads. The reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and approach roads shall be executed as follows: 
1.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
2.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
3.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
f.  On stream structures built for purpose of backing up water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero feet when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating that a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention. 
2.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning. 
3.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin. 
4.  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control. 
5.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
g.  Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
h.  Excavation in floodway. When an excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
1.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
2.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
3.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
4.  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
i.  Channel modification. If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. 
2.  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values. 
3.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
i.  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
ii.  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
iii.  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
iv.  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
v.  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
vi.  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
vii.  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
viii.  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
ix.  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
x.  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
xi.  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification. 
4.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
j.  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
k.  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
2.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
3.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off-site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
4.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing channels. (See subsection (3)p. of this section.) Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
5.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the Green Book and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
l.  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
m.  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. General criteria for analysis of flood elevations is as follows: 
1.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in section 50-56, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
2.  If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
3.  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
n.  Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the village in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. 
o.  Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
p.  Construction within 25 feet of channel. For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
1.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
2.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
3.  The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream maintenance purposes. 
After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the designated floodway designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the as-built plans. 
(4)  State review. For those projects listed in this subsection located in a designated floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway: 
a.  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection (3)d. of this section. 
b.  An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection (3)e. of this section. 
c.  Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections (3)a., (3)b. and (3)h. of this section. 
d.  The construction IDNR/OWR projects, dams and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the village or county. 
e.  An engineer's determination that a proposed bridge affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller opening. 
f.  Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood profiles. 
g.  Projects in public bodies of water. 
(5)  Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. No correspondence from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the division has delegated this responsibility to the village. 
(6)  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in Section 300.16 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain a state IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the Public Works Department finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the Public Works Department shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office. If the Public Works Department finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Public Works Department shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA). 
(7)  Activities that do not require registered professional engineer's review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article, including the mitigation requirements. 
a.  Regional Permit 3 which authorizes, for example, underground and overhead utilities, storm and sanitary sewer outfalls, sidewalks, patios, athletic fields, playground equipment and streambank protection activities. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 1, 6-25-08; Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 9-25-18) 
Sec. 50-60. - Occupation and use of SFHA areas where floodways are not identified. 
    In SFHA or floodplains, including AE, AH, AO and unnumbered A zones, where no floodways have been identified and no base or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
(1)  Development permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall commence any development in a SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the Public Works Department. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Public Works Department. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions; and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section 50-61. The application for a development permit shall also include the following information: 
a.  A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and intended use. 
b.  Site location, including a legal description of the property, drawn to scale, on the designated floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area. 
c.  Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity. 
d.  Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum: 
1.  A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale, and north arrow; 
2.  A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the structure of work, elevations using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale; 
3.  Cross section views of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, ten-year frequency flood elevations, 100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and 
4.  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance. 
e.  Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of this article. 
f.  Any or all other local, state and federal permits or approvals that may be required for this type of development. 
(2)  Elevation information. Based on the best available existing data according to the state water survey's floodplain information repository, the Public Works Department shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to section 50-56. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(3)  Copies of permits. The Public Works Department shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The Public Works Department shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(4)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been determined, shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. 
(5)  Riverine SFHA's. Within all riverine SFHA's where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply: 
a.  The developer shall have a licensed professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations, and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of section 50-59 for the entire floodplain as calculation under the provisions of section 50-56. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to IDNR/OWR for acceptance as a designated floodway. Upon acceptance of their floodway by the IDNR/OWR and FEMA, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of section 50-59 for the designated floodway. 
b.  A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR. 
d.  Dam safety permit. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in Section 300.16 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the Public Works Department finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the Public Works Department shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office. If the Public Works Department finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Public Works Department shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett Office, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA). 
e.  The following activities may be permitted without a licensed professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and designated floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article.

6.  Outfall structures and drainage ditch outlets meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 7. 
7.  Underground pipeline and utility crossings meeting the conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 8. 
8.  Bank stabilization projects meeting the conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 9. 
9.  Accessory structures and additions to existing residential buildings meeting the conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 10. 
10.  Minor maintenance dredging activities meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 11. 
11.  Bridge and culvert replacement structures and bridge widenings meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 12; 
12.  Temporary construction activities meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 13. 
13.  Special Uses of Public Waters meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 14. 
14.  A development determined by IDNR/OWR to be located entirely within a flood fringe area shall be exempt from state floodway permit requirements. 
f.  The flood-carrying capacity within any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
(6)  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 2008-31, § 1, 6-25-08; Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 9-25-18) 
Sec. 50-61. - Permitting requirements applicable to all floodplain areas. 
    In addition to the requirements found in sections 50-58, 50-59 and 50-60 for development in flood fringes, designated floodways, and SFHA or floodplains where no floodways have been identified the following requirements shall be met: 
(1)  Public health standards. Public health standards are as follows: 
a.  No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE unless such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and certified by a professional engineer or floodproofed building constructed according to the requirement of this article. 
b.  Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
c.  Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. 
d.  New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted, providing all manholes or other aboveground openings located below the FPE are watertight. 
e.  All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages. 
(2)  Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse. 
(3)  Protecting buildings. Protecting buildings shall be accomplished as follows: 
a.  All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain also known as a SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. However, existing buildings located within a designated floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in section 50-59. This building protection criteria applies to the following situations: 
1.  Construction or placement of a new building or alteration or addition to an existing building valued at more than $1,000.00 or 70 square feet. 
2.  Substantial improvements or structural alterations made to an existing building that either increases the first floor area by more than 20 percent or the building's market value by more than 50 percent. Alteration shall be figured cumulatively during a ten-year period. If substantially improved, the existing structure and the addition must meet the flood protection standards of this section. 
3.  Repairs made to a substantially damaged building. These repairs shall be figured cumulatively during a ten-year period. If substantially damaged the entire structure must meet the flood protection standards of this section. 
4.  Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site; this building protection requirement does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage. 
5.  Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days per year. 
6.  Repetitive loss to an existing building as defined in this article. This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods. 
b.  This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods: 
1.  A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed, may be constructed on permanent land fill in accordance with the following: 
i.  The lowest floor, including the basement, shall be at or above the flood protection elevation. 
ii.  The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than six inches deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or other structural measure. The fill shall be composed or rock or soil and not incorporate debris or refuse materials. The fills shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties, and when necessary, stormwater management techniques such as swales or basins shall be incorporated. 
2.  A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance with the following: 
i.  The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space, stilts, piles, walls, or other foundation that is permanently open to floodwaters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. Designs must either be certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect or the permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above grade, and consists of a minimum of two openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood elevation. 
ii.  The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice and floating debris. 
iii.  All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 78-1. - Statement of purpose. 
    This chapter creates the legal framework for commercial signage regulations that are intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable communication between people. It recognizes the need for a well-maintained and attractive appearance in a community and the need for adequate business identification, advertising and communication. While this chapter does not attempt to legislate the full extent of aesthetics and design quality for signage since individual opinions vary and general public opinions vary from one era to another, it is recognized that a great percentage of that which is unattractive can be eliminated by sensible quality control through adequate maintenance and inspection and by reasonable guidelines formulated to minimize clutter. The purpose of this legal framework is to create a system of sign controls that will: 
(1)  Protect the health, safety, and general welfare; 
(2)  Protect the constitutional right to free speech while not creating a nuisance to neighboring properties and upon the village as a whole; 
(3)  Support the desired visual character of the village; and 
(4)  Prevent traffic hazards. 
(Ord. No. 2011-29, § 1, 5-24-11) 
Sec. 78-2. - Scope. 
    This chapter does not in any manner regulate the written or depicted copy on any individual sign, but only the height, area, location and other similar aspects of signs and sign structures. The scope of this chapter addresses and authorizes the use of signs intended to be viewed external to a building and to be viewed by the public provided the signs are: 
(1)  Designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner that they do not endanger public safety or traffic safety. 
(2)  Legible, readable and visible in the circumstances in which they are used. 
(3)  Respectful of the reasonable rights of other advertisers whose messages are displayed. 
(Ord. No. 2011-29, § 1, 5-24-11) 
Sec. 78-3. - General sign design intent. 
    The following are general sign design guidelines that supplement the purpose of this chapter and provide direction on the general goals for the function and visual character of signage. 
(1)  Legibility of signs: 
a.  Signs should be adequately legible under the circumstances in which they are primarily seen. The legibility of signs is related to: 
1.  The speed at which they are viewed; 
2.  The context and surroundings in which they are seen; and 
3.  The design, colors and contrast of the sign copy and sign face. 
b.  The design of the sign including copy, lettering size and style, and colors should logically relate to the predominant speed of traffic which will see it. Signs should legibly convey their messages without being distracting or unsafe to motorists reading them. 
c.  The number of different lettering styles on a sign or on a series of signs within a complex of buildings should be minimized and should relate to the overall architectural concept for the property. 
d.  Lettering and copy should not be crowded onto the surface of a sign or building surface and shall be composed to leave ample space around the copy to preserve legibility. 
(2)  Relationship of signs to their surroundings: 
a.  Signs should not detract from the general appearance and architectural character of their surroundings including streets, buildings and other signs in the area. 
b.  Signs should not be designed to compete with one another but shall contribute to the composite legibility and attractiveness of streets within the village. 
(3)  Relationship of signs to the building and site locations: 
a.  Signs should be an integral architectural element of the building and site locations upon which they are located and their design shall be consistent with, and not detract from, the overall architectural concept of their site. 
b.  The scale of signs should be compatible and harmonious with the building or site locations and the signs should not be of such a size that they visually overpower the buildings on the site. 
c.  The outlined shapes of wall signs should be compatible with the building façade they are mounted on and should limit any disruptions in the architectural order of the building façade. 
(4)  The quality and craftsmanship of signs: 
a.  Signs should be carefully crafted, durable and consistent with the quality and character of their building and site location. 
b.  All signs should be regularly maintained and repaired or replaced in response to the aging and weathering of their materials.

Sec. 78-143. - Structural design. 
(a)  General. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind and seismic forces as specified in this section. All bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer horizontal forces to the foundations. For signs mounted on buildings, the vertical and horizontal loads shall be transmitted through the structure of the building to the ground in such a manner as not to overstress any of the elements thereof. The overturning moment produced from horizontal forces acting on a sign shall in no case exceed two-thirds of the dead load resisting moment. Uplift due to overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structure of the supporting building. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead load resisting moment. Such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly compacted. 
(b)  Wind loads. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind forces as specified in the building code as adopted by the village. 
(c)  Combined loads. Wind and seismic loads need not be combined in the design of signs or sign structures; only that loading producing the larger stresses need be used. 
(d)  Non-electric ground signs. Seismic or wind loads need not be considered in the design of non-electric ground signs 50 square feet or less in sign area and eight feet or less in height to the center of gravity. Vertical loads shall be assumed to act simultaneously with wind or seismic loads in designing signs and their supports. 
(e)  Allowable stresses. The design of wood, concrete, aluminum or steel members shall conform to the requirements of the building code as adopted by the village. Vertical and horizontal loads exerted on the shell shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in the building code as adopted by the village. The working stresses of wire rope and its fastenings shall not exceed 25 percent of the ultimate strength of the rope or fasteners. Working stresses for wind or seismic loads combined with dead loads may be increased as specified in the building code as adopted by the village. 
(f)  Anchorage. Members supporting unbraced signs shall be so proportioned that the bearing load imposed on the soil in either horizontal or vertical directions shall not exceed allowable values. Braced ground signs shall be anchored to resist the specified wind or seismic load acting in any direction. Anchors and supports shall be designed for safe bearing loads on the soil and for an effective resistance to pull-out equivalent to a force 25 percent greater than the required resistance to overturning. Signs attached to masonry, concrete or steel shall be safely and securely fastened thereto by means of approved metal anchors, bolts or expansion screws of sufficient size and strength to support the loads applied. No wood blocks, plugs or anchors of wood used in connection with screws or nails shall be considered an adequate connection, except in the case of signs attached to wood framing. No anchor or support for any sign shall be connected to, or supported by, an unbraced parapet wall, unless such wall is designed in accordance with the requirements for parapet walls specified in the building code as adopted by the village.

    For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

(6)  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service; 
(7)  Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);

    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state , or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.

In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by this article.

As used in this ordinance, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.

Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

Sec. 96-106. - Effect of permit. 
(a)  Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article on village rights-of-way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way. 
(b)  Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. 
(c)  Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners. 
(d)  Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2007-58, § 2, 11-27-07) 
Sec. 96-107. - Revised permit drawings.

The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section 96-121 of this article. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. 
(Ord. No. 2007-58, § 2, 11-27-07) 
Sec. 96-108. - Insurance.

(4)  Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000.00 per employee and per accident. 
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section. 
(b)  Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss. 
(c)  Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to the village within ten days following receipt of a written request therefor from the village. 
(d)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:

A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. 
(f)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
(g)  Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.

(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this article; and 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and

Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have.

(b)  Collocation Requirements and Conditions. 
(1)  Public Safety Space Reservation. The Village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
(2)  Installation and Maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small and micro wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
(3)  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small and micro wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
A wireless provider shall install small and micro wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small and micro wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
(4)  The Village may terminate a permit for a small and micro wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
The wireless provider shall not collocate small and micro wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small and micro wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(5)  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(6)  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards, as described herein below, that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark. 
(7)  Alternate Placements. Except as provided in this Collocation Requirements and Conditions Section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small and micro wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the small or micro wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.

Sec. 102-31. - Basis for sewer service charges. 
(a)  Sewer users served by water utility water meters. There is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building, or premises having a connection with the wastewater collection system and being served with water solely by the water utility, a sewer service charge based, in part, on the quantity of water used, as measured by the water utility water meter used upon the premises. 
(b)  Sewer users served by private wells. If any person discharging wastewater into the public sanitary sewers procures any part or all of his water from sources other than the water utility, all or part of which is discharged into the sanitary sewers, the person shall have water meters installed, if required by the water utility, at the person's expense for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these sources. Where sewer meters are already installed, new water meters will not be required. The water meters shall be furnished by the water utility and installed under its supervision, all costs being at the expense of the person requiring the meter. The water utility will charge for each meter a rental charge set by the water utility to compensate for the cost of furnishing and servicing the meter. The rental charge shall be billed at the time the sewer service charge is billed. 
(c)  Deduct meters. If a user feels that a significant amount of metered water does not reach the sanitary sewer, the user may avail himself of one of the following options: 
(1)  The user may request the approving authority to have such additional meters or metered services installed as are necessary to calculate the volume of water not discharged to the sanitary sewer, i.e., a deduct meter, or, he may request the approving authority to have a meter installed to measure the actual amount of sewage discharged to the sanitary sewer, i.e., a sewage meter. Requests for a second meter or metered services must be made in writing to the approving authority. If the approving authority agrees to such installation, the customer shall be charged all costs attendant thereto including, but not limited to, a meter yoke for each meter, to be installed by a licensed plumber; meter rental, in an amount set annually by the approving authority, such meter will be owned by the village and subject to access and inspection by village personnel at all reasonable times; remote reading devices, if necessary; and labor and miscellaneous parts and supplies. No provision shall be made, nor shall any means be taken, to route water from any deduct meter to the customer's general distribution system. In addition to the general penalties set forth in section 102-27, any violation of this section will result in nullification of the deduct readings and removal of the deduct meter. 
(2)  If it is physically impractical or impossible to install metering equipment, the user may request the approving authority to take such means as it deems necessary to formulate an estimate of the amount of water not being discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, or, conversely, the amount of actual sewage discharged thereto. 
(3)  Neither of the options set forth in this subsection shall be applicable or available to customers for reasons which are attendant to use of water for the filling of pools or watering of lawns and outdoor greenery.

    Village personnel or its authorized agent will have the right to inspect the portions of the development subject to the plan without prior notice during regular business hours. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-90. - Stormwater runoff management. 
    All developments subject to stormwater management requirements must be designed to manage the 100-year storm event and to provide means to manage and safely direct overflows to the public right-of-way. A minimum of 0.2 feet of freeboard from the high-water level within any detention facility to the overflow to the right-of-way must be provided. An additional 0.2 feet (minimum) freeboard must be provided from the lowest overflow elevation leading to an adjacent property. No more than 400 square feet of impervious surface area can sheet flow to the public right-of-way without detention. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-91. - Control of stormwater discharge rate. 
    Proposed developments that disturb 15,000 square feet or more and is 15 percent impervious or greater must control the rate of stormwater discharge from the property. Rate control will be accomplished by providing stormwater detention with a restrictor device to achieve the target release rate. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-92. - MWRD. 
    If the MWRD requires detention for any proposed development, the MWRD requirements shall govern the design of the detention facilities. All other requirements of the Stormwater Management Ordinance must still be met. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-93. - Release rate: Developments greater than 72,600 square feet. 
    The standard release rate in the 100-year critical duration storm for developments greater than 72,600 square feet is 0.15 cfs per acre. Higher release rates may be allowed as per section 102-95. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-94. - Release rate: Developments less than 72,600 square feet. 
    Developments less than 72,600 square feet in size cannot practicably achieve a release rate of 0.15 cfs per acre without using an approved non-clogging restrictor device. Release rates for developments of 15,000 square feet to 72,600 square feet in size may be determined below as follows: 
(a)  For sites between 15,000 square feet and 21,780 square feet (one-half acre), the maximum allowable release rate is 0.15 cfs, which must be achieved using an approved restrictor device. The required storage is based on 0.15 cfs. 
(b)  For sites between 21,780 square feet (one-half acre) and 43,560 square feet (one acre), the maximum regulated release rate is a linear interpolation between 0.15 cfs and 0.25 cfs, respectively. The required storage is based on the linear interpolation of the two release rates. In this case, an approved restrictor device with a release rate of 0.25 cfs will be installed for sites greater than 32,670 square feet. 
(c)  For sites between 43,560 square feet up to 76,200 square feet (1.67 acres), the maximum allowable release rate is 0.25 cfs, which must be achieved using an approved restrictor device. The required storage is based on 0.25 cfs. 
The above requirements are illustrated in the following chart. 

(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-95. - Niles outlet capacity release rates. 
    Based on engineering studies, the village may determine if certain sewersheds (the area tributary to a sewer outfall) have capacities that exceed the standard release rate of 0.15 cfs per acre. If such conditions are found, the allowable release rates will be published with a map of the corresponding sewersheds. Developments draining to those sewersheds may then use the higher published release rate (if applicable) for calculating the required detention volume and restrictor size. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-96. - Storage volume. 
    The amount of required 100-year storage must be based on the modified rational method. The Village of Niles Detention Calculator Spreadsheet which uses the modified rational method and is available from the Village Engineer. 
(a)  The average rainfall intensity used in the design formula shall be based on 100-year rainfall frequencies set forth in Bulletin 70 "Frequency Distributions and Hydroclimatic Characteristics of Heavy Rainstorms in Illinois" prepared by the Illinois State Water Survey, 1989. 
(b)  The C-values to be used in the calculation shall be based on the following: 
Asphalt Roof, Pavement = 0.95 
Gravel = 0.70 
Vegetated areas = 0.30 
Dry bottom detention basins to HWL = 0.75 
Water = 1.00 
The spreadsheet tool uses the modified rational method to compute the required detention volume in the critical duration 100-year storm. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-97. - Allowable detention facilities. 
    Methods of acceptable detention are dry, wet or wetland bottom detention basins, underground detention vaults, underground oversized pipes, and parking lot detention. Parking Lot detention must not exceed a maximum depth of six inches. Calculations substantiating the proposed detention volume at the high water level (HWL) must be provided. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-98. - Restrictors. 
    Restrictors must be sized in accordance with the maximum release rate and high water level. When using the standard release rate, an approved non-clogging controlled release rate restrictor must be used as shown in chart "Figure 1 Release Rate for Properties less than 1.67 acres." When other control structures are used, the discharge shall be calculated using the orifice equation with the correct discharge coefficient (Cd) as follows: 
Cd= 0.61 for sharp-edged plate bolted to a catch basin. 
Cd = 0.82 for pipes less than 2-feet long grouted into sewer. 
The hydraulic head on a restrictor must be computed from the high water elevation to the invert of a half-trap with restrictor. Conventional restrictors shall be controlled either a single pipe outlet or orifice plate and shall be a minimum three-inch diameter. Pipe restrictors shall consist of a minimum two-foot long pipe. If a three-inch restrictor is insufficient for providing the required rate control, a non-clogging orifice design down to a minimum two and one-half-inch diameter may be submitted for review. In all cases, a custom device (such as a vortex valve) that provides the required rate control may be proposed, subject to review. 
Restrictors must be placed in a structure that allows for direct access for cleanout and maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 2011-18, § 1, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 102-99. - Plan amendments.

2.4 - RULES OF MEASUREMENT 
    This section provides the rules of measurement for the dimensional standards and locational characteristics within the Ordinance. 
A.  Block and Blockface. 
1.  A block is a tract of land bounded by streets, or a combination of streets and railroad rights-of-way, or municipal boundary lines. 
2.  Blockface is measured as that portion of a block or tract of land facing the same side of a street and lying between the closest intersecting streets, or between an intersecting street and a railroad right-of-way or municipal boundary line. 

B.  Building Coverage. Building coverage of a lot is the area of a lot occupied by the principal and accessory buildings. Building coverage is calculated as the percentage of principal and accessory building footprint area to the total area of the lot. 
C.  Building Height and Story. 
1.  Building height is measured as the vertical distance from the adjacent grade of the front of a structure to the peak of the roof. 
2.  The following structures or parts thereof are exempt from the height limitations of the districts or any individual height restrictions of the use, unless otherwise limited by any federal or state height restriction. 
a.  Public utility poles, towers, and wires. 
b.  Water tanks and standpipes. 
c.

However, if such appurtenances occupy more than 25% of the total roof area, they are counted toward building height. 
3.  A story is each level of a building included between the surface of any floor and the surface of the floor next above it, or if there is no floor above, then the space between the floor and the ceiling next above it. A half-story is the uppermost story or partial story of a structure where 50% or more of the floor area has a ceiling height of seven feet or less. 


D.  Building Line. A line established at the building wall of a structure between lot lines. For the purposes of establishing a building line, the building wall does not include permitted encroachments or architectural features, such as bay windows, eaves, and steps and stoops. For irregular lots where the lot lines are not parallel, the building line is established as a line from the point of the structure closest to the lot line, drawn parallel to the applicable lot line. 

E.  Caliper. The diameter of the trunk of a tree measured in inches at a point measured 12 inches above the ground. 
F.  Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). The diameter of the trunk of a mature and established tree measured in inches at a point four feet above ground level. 
G.  Grade. Grade is measured as the average level of the finished surface of the ground adjacent to the exterior walls of the structure. 

H.  Gross Floor Area (GFA). The gross floor area (GFA) of a structure is the sum of the gross horizontal areas of all floors of the structure as measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the centerline of party walls separating two buildings. 
I.  Impervious Surface Coverage (ISR). Impervious surface coverage is a measure of that portion of a site that is occupied by structures, pavement, and other impervious surfaces that do not allow for the absorption of water. Impervious surface coverage is calculated as the percentage of all impervious surface area against the total area of the lot. Impervious surface areas include gravel and open water surface areas, such as water features and swimming pools. Credit may be granted for pervious pavers and other alternative pavement systems subject to the standards established by the Village's Engineering Division. 
J.  Lighting. 
1.  Luminaire Height. The height of a luminaire is measured as the vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the top of the pole or luminaire, whichever the case may be. 
2.  Footcandle. A footcandle (FC) is a unit of illumination produced on a surface, all points of which are one foot from a uniform point source of one standard candle. Footcandle is measured utilizing a direct reading, portable light meter mounted in a horizontal position. 

K.  Lot. 
1.  An interior lot is a lot other than a corner, reverse corner, or through lot, typically bounded by two interior side lot lines. 
2.  A corner lot is a lot situated at the junction of, and abutting on, two or more intersecting streets. 
3.  A reverse corner lot is a corner lot where the side lot line adjoining a street is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the first lot to its rear. 
4.  A through lot is a lot that has frontage on two non-intersecting streets creating two front lot lines. 

L.  Lot Area. The total area of a lot calculated as the total area bounded by all lot lines. 
M.  Lot Line. A lot line is the property line of any lot. Lot lines are located as follows. 
1.  Front Lot Line 
a.  The front lot line of an interior lot is the lot line that abuts a street. 
b.  The front lot line of a corner lot is the shortest lot line that abuts a street. 
c.  The front lot line of a through lot is established as follows: 
i.  For through lots where a front lot line has been previously established on one or more lots located on the same blockface, the street designated as the front lot line of the through lots in such blockface is the front lot line. Previously established means one or more structures along the blockface have established front entrances along that lot line. 
ii.  For through lots where a front line has not been previously established on one or more lots on the same blockface or where all lots have not established front lot lines along the same street, the front lot line will be designated by the Director of Community Development. 
2.  Interior Side Lot Line. The interior side lot line is a lot line not abutting a street that is not a rear lot line. 
3.  Corner Side Lot Line. The lot line that is perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the front lot line, which is the longer abutting street lot line of a corner lot. 
4.  Rear Lot Line. The rear lot line is that lot line which is opposite and most distant from and is, or most nearly is, parallel to the front lot line. 

N.  Lot Width . Lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the front lot line at the minimum front setback line. For irregular lots, such as cul-de-sac lots or pie-shaped lots, lot width is measured at the front building line of the structure between side lot lines. 

O.  Separation/Required Distance Between. When the Ordinance requires separation between structures or uses located on separate lots, such separation is measured between the closest lot lines of the two lots. When the Ordinance requires separation between structures or uses located on the same lot, such separation is measured between building walls. 

P.  Sight Triangle. A sight triangle is located at the intersection of the street or alley right-of-way, access easement, and/or driveway pavement, is measured at a line joining the points at a distance as follows: 
a.  Five feet from the point of the intersection of driveways and the lot line, as measured along the lot line and edge of driveway pavement. 
b.  For intersections forming a 90-degree angle, 15 feet down each street measured along the right-of-way. 

c.  For intersections forming an angle greater than 90 degrees, 15 feet down each street measured along the right-of-way, minus two feet for each 20 degrees or fraction thereof the angle exceeds 90 degrees. 
d.  For intersections forming an angle less than 90 degrees, 15 feet down each street measured along the right-of-way, plus 2 feet for each 20 degrees or fraction thereof the angle is less than 90 degrees. 

Q.  Yards and Setbacks. A yard is the open space area between a principal building and the adjoining lot line. A required setback may be equal to or lesser than a yard and is the required minimum distance a principal building must be located from a lot line, which is unoccupied and unobstructed by any portion of a principal building or accessory structure, unless permitted by this Ordinance. A setback extends along a lot line for the minimum depth specified by the zoning district in which such lot is located. 
The minimum yard space required for one structure shall not again be considered as yard space for another adjoining structure. 
No lot shall be reduced in area so that the yards or other open space become less than required by this ordinance. 
a.  Front Yard and Setback. A front yard is located between a principal building and the front lot line. A front setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the front lot line. The front yard and setback extends the full width of the lot between side lot lines measured perpendicular to the front lot line. 
b.  Interior Side Yard and Setback. An interior side yard is located between a principal building and the interior side lot line. An interior side setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the interior side lot line. The interior side yard and setback extends along the interior side lot line between the front and rear setback lines, measured perpendicular to the interior side lot line. 
c.  Corner Side Yard and Setback. A corner side yard is located between a principal building and the corner side lot line. A corner side setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the corner side lot line. The corner side yard and setback extends along the corner side lot line between the front setback line and the rear lot line, measured perpendicular to the corner side lot line. 
d.  Rear Yard and Setback. A rear yard is located between a principal building and the rear lot line. A rear setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the rear lot line. In the case of an interior lot, the rear yard and setback extends between interior side lot lines, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line. In the case of a corner lot, the rear yard and setback extends between the interior side lot line to the required corner side setback, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line. 
e.  Reverse Corner Side Yard and Setback. A reverse corner side yard is located between a principal building and the corner side lot line, where the corner side lot line adjoining a street is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the first lot to its rear. A reverse corner side setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from corner side lot line. The reverse corner side yard and setback extends along the corner side lot line between the front setback line and the rear lot line, measured perpendicular to the corner side lot line. For reverse corner lots, the lot width dimension used to determine the reverse corner side setback is measured at the shorter of the two street abutting lot lines; the "corner side setback" dimensional requirement in the district applies to the reverse corner side setback.

OR Office/Research District 
D.  Special Purpose Districts. 
P-I Public/Institutional Lands District 
3.2 - ZONING 
MAP 
A.  Location of Districts. 
1.  The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance are set forth in the Official Zoning Map, as periodically amended. The Official Zoning Map is incorporated into, and made part of, this Ordinance. 
2.  It is the intent of this Ordinance that the entire area of the Village, including all land and water areas, are included in the zoning districts established by this Ordinance. Any land lying within the Village, but not shown on the Official Zoning Map as being included within a district, is classified as the R-1 Single-Family Residential District. 
B.  Interpretation of Boundary Lines . 
1.  Right-of-Way Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with rights-of-way, the boundary line is construed to be the centerline of the right-of-way. 
2.  Property Lines. Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a recorded property line, the property line is construed to be the boundary line of the district. 
3.  Scaled Lines. Where the district boundary lines do not coincide with a right-of-way line or recorded property line, the district boundary is determined by measuring such boundary line(s) using the map scale as provided on the Official Zoning Map. 
4.  Clarification of Boundary Lines. Where the application of Paragraphs 1 through 3 above leaves doubt as to the boundary between two zoning districts, the Director of Community Development will decide any interpretations of zoning district boundary lines. Decisions of the Director of Community Development may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Board. 
3.3 - ANNEXED LAND 
    Any territory annexed into the Village is automatically, upon annexation, zoned as the R-1 Single-Family Residential District, unless otherwise provided for in the annexation agreement or until the territory is rezoned. 
3.4 - EXEMPTIONS FOR RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND PUBLIC UTILITIES 
1.  The provisions of this Ordinance do not apply to land located within rights-of-way. 
2.  The following utility uses are exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance and permitted in any district: wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals, pipes, mains, hydrants, valves and water supply wells. 
3.  This exemption does not include utilities, as defined in Article 8, wireless telecommunications, amateur HAM radio towers, solar farms, or wind energy systems. All such structures must comply with this Ordinance and any other applicable Village ordinances.

SECTION 5. - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS 

5.1 - PURPOSE STATEMENTS 
A.  C-1 Corridor Commercial District 
The purpose of the C-1 Corridor Commercial Zoning District is to promote development of storefront space and provide for a mix of retail, personal service, and office uses along the commercial corridors within the Village, primarily serving the local community. The C-1 District is intended to accommodate auto-oriented uses while improving the pedestrian environment along the Village's commercial corridors. Mixed-use development is encouraged with residential dwelling units allowed above the ground floor. 
B.  C-2 General Commercial District 
The purpose of the C-2 General Commercial District is to accommodate regional commercial centers within the Village, including auto-oriented retail centers that serve both residents of the Village and the surrounding communities. The C-2 District provides for large-scale development that generates a sizeable amount of traffic and a significant demand for off-street parking. Mixed-use development is encouraged with residential dwelling units allowed above the ground floor. 
C.  C-3 Milwaukee Avenue Form-Based District 
The purpose of the C-3 Milwaukee Avenue Form-Based District is to promote a high-quality mixed-use environment along the Milwaukee Avenue corridor within the Village. The C-3 District contains specific standards related to building form, including height and massing, building location, façade transparency, parking, and building design. These standards are intended to improve the image of the corridor, and encourage the development of Milwaukee Avenue as a pedestrian-friendly, walkable mixed-use destination. 
D.  C-4 Milwaukee Avenue Mixed-Use District 
The purpose of the C-4 Milwaukee Avenue Mixed-Use District is to promote a tailored mix of retail, personal service, office, and residential development along the Milwaukee Avenue Corridor within the Village, complementary in bulk and height to the Milwaukee Avenue Form-Based District. It should maintain a traditional mixed-use character, distinguished by a pedestrian-friendly orientation, building entrances opening to the public sidewalk, and parking, when provided, located to the rear of buildings. 
E.  C-5 Urban Village District 
The purpose of the C-5 Urban Village District is to promote redevelopment of large regional centers as mixed-use urban villages, rather than as traditional single-purpose shopping centers. The C-5 District provides controls on use mix, siting, and design to encourage a high-quality mixed-use and pedestrian friendly urban village development. 
5.2 - USES 
A.  Uses Generally 
1.  Section 8 lists permitted and special principal uses and temporary uses for the commercial districts. 
2.  In the C-3 District, uses are restricted per Figure 5.4: C-3 District Use Restrictions. Generally, Table 8-1 lists the uses allowed in the C-3 District unless Figure 5.4 indicates specific additional permissions or restrictions for uses. 
3.  Within the C-2, C-3, and C-4 Districts, ground floor uses on corner lots are limited to those listed under the "Retail" category in Table 8-1: Use Matrix. This limitation extends for 250 feet along the lot lines along each intersecting street and applies to any ground floor space where 50% or more of the space's frontage is located within this 250 foot measurement. 
4.  Residential density limits are controlled by bulk, height, parking, and other zoning regulations. 
5.3 - DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS 
    Table 5-1: Commercial Districts Dimensional Standards establishes the dimensional standards for the commercial districts. These regulations apply to all uses within each district unless a different standard is listed for a specific use. Within certain districts, the design standards of Section 5.4 also apply.

Street abutting building façades in excess of 100 feet must include a repeating pattern with no less than two of the following elements: color change, texture change, material module change, or a wall articulation change of no less than 18 inches in depth, such as a reveal, pilaster, or projecting rib, to visually break up the massing of the ground floor into segments of no more than 40 feet. 
d.  All buildings of three stories or greater must be designed with a definable base (ground floor) through the use of horizontal articulation or architectural features such as cornice treatments, belt courses, recesses, corbeling, awnings or canopies, and changes in window design or pattern. 
e.  Ground floor building entrances must address adjacent streets, and must be visually distinctive or prominent on the building façade. This may be accomplished through the use of architectural features such as entranceway roofs, canopies or awnings, entranceway recesses, a chamfered corner, sidelight windows, transom windows, or other adjacent window designs. 
f.  Ground floor building entrances may be recessed no more than six feet from the required front build-to zone, and must be no wider than ten feet. Such a recess is considered to meet any required minimum build-to percentage. 
g.  Street abutting building façades must provide a building entrance no less than once every 40 feet. 
h.  Buildings located within 50 feet of key corners as designated in Figure 5.4, measured parallel to the right-of-way, must address Niles' unique corner geometry through the inclusion of prominent architectural features. Such features include, but are not limited to, chamfered corners, "bull nose" building forms, or other vertical architectural elements. 
i.  Vents, air conditioners, and other utility elements, except where such elements are enclosed, camouflaged, screened, obscured, or otherwise not readily apparent to a casual observer, are prohibited as part of a front or corner side façade. 
2.  Fenestration Design 
a.  Windows must be recessed no less than two inches or projected out from the façade plane to provide depth and shadow. 
b.  A bulkhead or knee-height wall a minimum of 18 inches and a maximum of 36 inches in height is required along any street abutting façade to provide a definable base and give visual weight to required ground floor glazing. 
c.  The ground floor must maintain a minimum transparency of 60%, measured between two and ten feet in height from grade. Building façades located within 50 feet of key corners as designated in Figure 5.4, measured parallel to the right-of-way, must maintain a minimum transparency of 75% measured between two and ten feet in height from grade. 
d.  Upper stories must maintain a minimum transparency of 30% of the wall area of the story. 
3.  Roof Design 
a.  Rooflines over 100 linear feet in building length must be variegated and incorporate a major focal point feature, such as a dormer, gable, or projected wall feature. An element of variegation on the roofline must occur at intervals of no more than 75 feet. 
b.  Parapet walls must feature three-dimensional cornice treatments or other shadow-creating details along their tops. 
c.  Green roof, blue roof, and white roof designs are encouraged. 
d.  Reflective surfaces that produce glare are prohibited, except for solar panels or white roofs intended to radiate absorbed or non-reflected solar energy and reduce heat transfer to the building. 
e.  Mechanical equipment on roofs must be located a minimum of five feet behind the building wall, and must be screened from view from public rights-of-way by the use of parapet walls or enclosures designed to conceal the equipment.

6.1 - PURPOSE STATEMENTS 
A.  M Limited Industrial District 
The purpose of the M Limited Manufacturing Zoning District is to provide for general industrial, research and development, warehousing, wholesaling, and office uses. Industrial uses in the M District may produce noise, vibration, odor, heat glare, and other external effects perceptible to adjacent land users, but are generally not offensive or noxious. Development standards are intended to buffer surrounding non-industrial uses from the impact of the industrial uses within the district. 
B.  ENT-MU Cultural/Entertainment-Mixed-Use District 
The purpose of the ENT-MU Entertainment Mixed-Use Zoning District is to provide for a mix of light industrial uses found in the M District, as well as certain compatible non-industrial uses that are more intensive, such as recreational and entertainment uses and retail establishments consistent with the Village's plans for the Touhy Triangle cultural and entertainment district. Development standards are intended to buffer surrounding less intense uses from the impact of the industrial and commercial uses within the district. 
C.  OR Office/Research District 
The purpose of the O-R Office-Research Zoning District is to accommodate research and development facilities and larger office structures with limited industrial uses allowed that have no outside impacts. Examples of typical O-R District uses might include the headquarters of a large corporation, large research and development facilities, or office parks of substantial size.

SECTION 8. - USES 

8.1 - GENERAL USE PERMISSIONS 
A.  No structure or land may be used or occupied except in conformity with the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. 
B.  All uses must comply with any applicable federal and state requirements and any regulations of the Village Code. 
C.  Noncompliance with any of the use standards of this Section and any conditions imposed as a part of the approval of a special use or other zoning approval is considered a violation of this Ordinance and subject to enforcement provisions. 
D.  A non-residential lot may contain more than one principal use, so long as each principal use is allowed in the district. Each principal use must be approved separately, even if the uses function as a whole development. For example, a gas station may have a car wash or a minor vehicle repair if a car wash or a minor vehicle repair use is allowed in the district. In some cases, the principal use standards and/or definition may identify ancillary uses that are an integral part of the principal use's operation. When identified as an ancillary use, the ancillary use does not require separate approval, but must comply with any standards applicable to such use. 
E.  Any use not listed within Table 8-1: Use Matrix of Section 8.2 is prohibited. 
8.2 - USE MATRIX 
A.  Table 8-1: Use Matrix identifies the principal and temporary uses allowed within each zoning district. P indicates that the use is permitted in the district. S indicates that the use is a special use in the district and requires special use permit approval. If a cell is blank, the use is not allowed in the district. In the case of temporary uses, a P indicates the temporary use is allowed in the district and the standards may indicate that it requires temporary use permit approval in accordance with the standards of Section 8.4. 
B.  Within the C-2, C-3, and C-4 Districts, ground floor uses on corner lots are limited to those listed under the "Retail" category in Table 8-1: Use Matrix. This limitation extends for 250 feet along the lot lines along each intersecting street and applies to any ground floor space where 50% or more of the space's frontage is located within this 250 foot measurement.

(Ord. No. 2017-58, § 2(Exh. 1), 11-28-17) 
10.4 - REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES 
A.  The minimum number of off-street parking spaces to be provided for a use is delineated in Table 10-2: Off-Street Parking Requirements. Table 10-2 lists parking requirements for the uses listed within the districts. In some cases, uses which are considered part of a generic use category are listed with specified parking requirements. These specific uses are listed only for the purposes of this section and do not indicate whether such uses are permitted or special uses within any district. 
B.  Certain uses listed within the districts do not have parking requirements. These uses are not listed in Table 10-2. 
C.  The total number of required parking spaces is calculated by the principal use of the lot. When more than one use occupies the same lot, the number of required spaces is the sum of the separate requirements for each use, unless a shared parking arrangement is approved or such use is a multi-tenant retail center, which has a separate requirement. The following standards for computation apply: 
1.  Space allocated to any off-street loading space may not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street parking space or access aisle, or portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street parking space may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-street loading space or portion thereof. 
2.  A fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, and a fraction of one-half or more is counted as one parking space. 
3.  In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or similar seating facilities, each 36 inches of such seating facility is counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for off-street parking facilities. Floor area of a prayer hall is counted as one seat per marked prayer mat space or one seat for every six square feet in the prayer hall if prayer mat spaces are not marked. 
D.  Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated parking spaces for car-share facilities. A car-share facility is a membership-based car-sharing service that provides automobile rental to members, billable by the hour or day; it is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. Spaces reserved for car-share facilities may count toward minimum parking requirements of this Ordinance in the amount of four spaces or 5% of the total number of spaces, whichever is greater. 
E.  As of the effective date of this Ordinance, the number of parking spaces currently provided on the lot of an existing non-residential use along Milwaukee Avenue are deemed conforming. Once the existing use in the principal building discontinued, or once the principal building is demolished, the deemed conforming provision is no longer valid. In addition, if the lot area is expanded (e.g., the adjoining lot is purchased), the deemed conforming provision is no longer valid. 
F.  Parking for multi-tenant retail centers is required as follows: A multi-tenant retail center is defined as a group of three or more non-residential establishments that are primarily retail establishments, but may include service and recreation and entertainment uses, which is planned, owned, and/or managed as a single property. The two main configurations of multi-tenant retail centers are large shopping centers or malls and retail strip centers. 
1.  Multi-tenant retail centers of less than 80,000 square feet: 
a.  As of the effective date of this Ordinance, the number of parking spaces currently provided on the lot of an existing multi-tenant retail centers of less than 80,000 square feet are deemed conforming and any use that requires 4 parking stalls or less per each 1,000 s.f. of gross floor area according to Table 10-2 is allowed without parking credits. Special uses must obtain the required special use permit. Any use a) that requires more than 4 parking stalls per each 1,000 s.f. of gross floor area according to Table 10-2 or b) that is designated with an asterisk in Table 10-2 must obtain parking credits according to the procedures in Section 15.10. Once the principal building is demolished, the deemed conforming provision is no longer valid. In addition, if the lot area is expanded (e.g., the adjoining lot is purchased), the deemed conforming provision is no longer valid. 
b.  New multi-tenant retail centers of less than 80,000 square feet that provide four spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area shall be deemed conforming and any use that requires 4 parking stalls or less per each 1,000 s.f. of gross floor area according to Table 10-2 is allowed without parking credits. Special uses must obtain the required special use permit. Any use a) that requires more than 4 parking stalls per each 1,000 s.f. of gross floor area according to Table 10-2 or b) that is designated with an asterisk in Table 10-7 must obtain parking credits according to the procedures in Section 15.10. 
2.  Multi-tenant retail centers of 80,000 square feet or more: 
a.  As of the effective date of this Ordinance, the number of parking spaces currently provided on the lot of an existing multi-tenant retail centers of 80,000 square feet or more are deemed conforming. No uses require parking credits. Once the principal building is demolished, the deemed conforming provision is no longer valid. In addition, if the lot area is expanded (e.g., the adjoining lot is purchased), the deemed conforming provision is no longer valid. 
b.  Multi-tenant retail centers built after the adoption of this ordinance with 80,000 square feet or more that provide three spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area shall be deemed conforming. No uses require parking credits.

10.8 - REQUIRED OFF-STREET LOADING SPACES 
A.  Design 
1.  Off-street loading spaces must be located as follows: 
a.  All off-street loading spaces must be located on the same lot as the use served. 
b.  No off-street loading space may be located in a front or corner side yard or in front of a front building line. 
c.  All off-street loading spaces must be located a minimum of 25 feet from the lot line of any residential district, unless completely enclosed by building walls or a uniformly painted solid fence or wall, or any combination thereof, a minimum of six feet in height and a maximum of eight feet in height. In such case, the loading area must be a minimum of 15 feet from such lot line. 
2.  All required off-street loading spaces must be at least 12 feet in width and at least 30 feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering space, and must have a minimum vertical clearance of at least 15 feet. 
3.  All off-street loading spaces must be improved with a hard surfaced, all-weather dustless material. 
4.  All off-street loading spaces must meet the exterior lighting standards of Section 9.2. 
5.  Loading berths must be screened along interior side and rear lot lines with a solid wall or fence, a minimum of six feet and a maximum of seven feet in height. 
6.  Central loading facilities may be substituted for loading berths on individual lots subject to the following: 
a.  Each lot served must have direct access to the central loading area without crossing streets or alleys at-grade. 
b.  No lot served may be more than 500 feet from the central loading area. 
B.  Required Number of Off-Street Loading Spaces 
Off-street loading spaces must be provided in accordance with Table 10-5: Off-Street Loading Requirements. In the case of multi-tenant buildings or mixed-use developments, required loading spaces are calculated on the basis of each individual tenant (for example, if only one commercial tenant of a multi-tenant building is over 10,000 square feet, only one loading space is required; if all tenants are under ten-thousand 10,000 square feet, no loading is required).

10.9 - TRAFFIC STUDY REQUIREMENT 
A.  Proposed new developments or proposed changes of use with significant traffic, as determined by the Director of Community Development, may be required to perform a traffic study. Approval of the proposed development or change in use will require compliance with the findings and recommendations of the traffic study which is approved by the Village of Niles. 
(Ord. No. 2017-58, § 2(Exh. 1), 11-28-17) 
SECTION 11. - LANDSCAPE 

11.1 - INTENT 
A.  Landscape improvements must serve to integrate the development into the site, with particular sensitivity to natural topography, watercourses, and existing significant native vegetation. Preservation of existing plant material and landforms shall be taken into account, particularly where mature or significant trees or native plant communities are a part of the site. This is of particular importance in cases where specimen trees, groves, or tree lines, or tree-lined watercourses are present. 
B.  Landscape improvements must serve to enhance the appearance of the site, especially as viewed from adjacent public rights-of-way. Effective year-round screening must be provided to lessen the visual prominence of parking lots, service yards, loading docks, public utility structures, or unsightly appurtenances. Landscape must also serve to minimize the harmful or nuisance effects resulting from noise, heat, glare, and accumulation of dust, and to provide shade, air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, storm water run-off management, and other environmental benefits. Innovative landscape design proposals are highly encouraged, including the use of green technology regarding storm water management and the use of native plant materials. 
C.  Preservation of existing trees as recommended by the Village Forester is encouraged. Where existing trees are to be protected, site development must comply with the applicable Village requirements as found in Section 106-38. 
11.2 - LANDSCAPE PLAN 
A.  Landscape Plan Required 
A landscape plan is required as part of a site plan review application for townhouse, multi-family, non-residential, or mixed-use development, and any planned unit development. The landscape plan must be approved prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
B.  Content of Landscape Plan 
1.  North arrow and graphic scale, the location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, property lines, easements, parking lots and drives, rights-of-way, refuse disposal and recycling areas, pedestrian and bicycle paths, fences, mechanical equipment, overhead utility wires, underground utilities, retention/detention facilities, and other drainage facilities, such as drainage swales. 
2.  The location, quantity, size, name, and condition, both botanical and common, of all existing plant materials on-site, indicating plant material to be retained and to be removed. 
3.  The location, quantity, size, and name, both botanical and common, of all proposed plant material. 
4.  The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at one foot intervals. Any proposed berming, earthwork, or storm water management basins must also be indicated using one foot contour intervals. 
5.  Elevations of all proposed fences, stairs, and retaining walls. 
6.  Any other details as determined necessary by the Director of Community Development. 
C.  Minor Changes to Approved Landscape Plans 
Minor changes to the landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net amount of plant material as specified on the approved landscape plan may be approved by the Director of Community Development. Changes to the amount of plant materials of an approved landscape plan are not considered a minor change. Major changes must be approved by the body granting approval of the landscape plan initially. 
11.3 - ENFORCEMENT OF LANDSCAPE PLAN 
A.  No certificate of occupancy will be issued until all the requirements of this Section and the landscape plan have been fulfilled. Failure to implement the landscape plan, or to maintain the lot in conformance with the landscape plan, may result in the application of fines and penalties, as established in this Ordinance. All landscape is subject to periodic inspection. 
B.  If weather prohibits the installation of landscape at the time a certificate of occupancy is applied for, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a six month period with provision of a security bond or security for 115% of the estimated amount, including installation. 
11.4 - SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE 
A.  Selection 
All plant materials must be of good quality and meet American Horticulture Industry Association (AmericanHort) or its ANSI accredited successor's standards for minimum acceptable form, quality and size for species selected, and capable to withstand the seasonal temperature variations of northeastern Illinois, as well as the individual site microclimate. The use of species native or naturalized to northeastern Illinois is encouraged. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria that must be considered when selecting plant material. Where appropriate, the use of drought and salt tolerant plant material is preferred. 
B.  Installation 
All landscape materials must be installed in accordance with current nursery industry standards, and must be properly supported to ensure survival. Support devices such as guy wires or stakes must not interfere with pedestrian or vehicular movement. All plant materials must be free of disease and installed so that soil of sufficient volume, composition, and nutrient balance are available to sustain healthy growth. Installation of plant materials during the appropriate growing season is encouraged. 
C.  Maintenance 
1.  Landscape materials depicted on approved landscape plans are considered a required site element in the same manner as structures, required parking, lighting, and other improvements. As such, the owner of record or the business or homeowner's association is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls, and similar landscape elements. 
2.  All landscape materials must be maintained in good condition, present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, and be kept free of refuse and debris. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants must be replaced within 60 days of notification, unless an extension is approved. 
11.5 - LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS 
A.  Minimum Planting Sizes 
1.  Shade trees must have a minimum trunk size of two and one-half inches in caliper at planting. 
2.  Evergreens trees must have a minimum height of four feet at planting. 
3.  Single stem ornamental trees must have a minimum trunk size of two and one-half inches in caliper at planting. Multiple stem ornamental trees must have a minimum height of eight feet at planting. 
4.  Large shrubs must have minimum height of three feet at installation. Small shrubs must have a minimum height of 18 inches at installation. Large shrubs are those that reach five or more feet in height at maturity. Small shrubs are those that may grow up to four feet in height if left unmaintained, but are generally maintained at heights of eighteen 18 to 30 inches. 
B.  Energy Conservation 
Plant material placement should be designed to provide passive benefits, and reduce the energy consumption needs of the development: 
1.  Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun. 
2.  Evergreens and other plant materials should be concentrated on the north and west sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds. 
C.  Species Diversity 
Diversity among required plant material is required for visual interest and to reduce the risk of losing a large population of plants due to disease. Table 11-1: Plant Diversity Requirements indicates the percentage of diversity required based on the total quantity of species being used. For example, if a development requires 45 shade trees, no more than 18 trees (40%) can be of one species, and there must be a minimum of five different species within the 45 trees. When the calculation of plant diversity requirements results in a fraction, the fraction is rounded up.

D.  Berming 
Earthen berms and existing topographic features should be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site where there is sufficient space and, in particular, when berms and existing topographic features can be combined with plant material to facilitate effective screening. Minimum unretained berm side slopes must be maintained at no steeper than a 4:1 slope ratio to prevent erosion and be properly and safely maintained, unless a steeper slope is allowed by the Director of Community Development. Retained slopes may be implemented with the appropriate terracing necessary to reduce the need for safety railing. 
11.6 - PARKING LOT PERIMETER LANDSCAPE YARD 
    A perimeter landscape yard is required for all parking lots that abut a public right-of-way, excluding alleys, and must be established along the edge of the parking lot to screen the parking lot. The landscape treatment must run the full length of the parking lot perimeter along the right-of-way and must be located between the lot line and the edge of the parking lot. The landscaped area must be improved as follows: 
A.  The perimeter parking lot landscape area must be at least five feet in width. There must be a minimum linear distance of two feet between any wheels stops or curbs to accommodate vehicle bumper overhang, which is not included in the minimum five foot calculation. 
B.  One shrub, measuring a minimum of 18 inches at planting and reaching a minimum of three feet at maturity, must be planted for every three feet of landscape yard length, spaced linearly, which may be excepted for the planting of a shade tree. Alternatively, a mix of shrubs, perennials, native grasses, and other planting types that provide screening of a minimum of three feet in height may be used. 
C.  A minimum of one shade tree must be provided for each 50 linear feet of perimeter landscape yard. Two ornamental trees may be substituted for each shade tree. 
D.  70% of the landscape area outside of shrub and tree masses must be planted in live groundcover, perennials, or ornamental grasses. 
E.  Alternatively, and with the approval of the Director of Community Development, a low pedestrian wall or decorative fence a minimum of three feet to a maximum of four feet in height may be used instead of shrubs and shade trees. Where feasible, plant materials shall be installed between the sidewalk and the low pedestrian wall or decorative fence to provide a softening effect on the wall or fence. 

(Ord. No. 2017-58, § 2(Exh. 1), 11-28-17) 
11.7 - INTERIOR PARKING LOT LANDSCAPE 
    All parking lots consisting of 15 or more spaces require interior parking lot landscape as described in this section. 
A.  All rows of parking stalls must terminate in a parking lot island or landscape area. 
B.  Where more than 25 parking stalls are provided in any single row, or where more than 50 parking stalls are provided in a double row, one parking lot island must be provided between every 25 parking spaces. As part of the landscape plan approval, parking lot island locations may be varied based on specific site requirements or design scheme, but the total number of islands must be no less than the amount required of one island for every 25 single row or 50 double row spaces. 
C.  Parking lot islands must be the same dimension as the parking stall. Double rows of parking must provide parking lot islands that are the same dimension as the double row. 
D.  A minimum of one shade tree must be provided for every parking lot island or landscape area. If a parking lot island extends the width of a double row, then two shade trees are required. In addition to the required shade trees, a minimum of 70% of every parking lot island must be planted in ornamental trees, live groundcover, shrubs, perennials, or ornamental grasses. 
E.  The use of storm water management techniques, such as rain gardens and bio-swales, is encouraged in landscape areas. Parking lot islands and landscape areas are encouraged to be designed to accommodate storm water infiltration. The Director of Community Development may reduce the requirements of item C above if it is demonstrated that such a reduction is necessary to accommodate storm water management techniques. 
F.  In addition to parking lot islands, additional landscape areas must be provided within the interior of parking lots. The minimum total landscape area of a parking lot, including parking lot islands, must be 10% of the total parking lot area. Parking lot perimeter landscape is excluded from the calculation of total parking lot area. 

11.8 - SITE LANDSCAPE 
    Except for landscaping standards for parking lot interiors as provided for in Section 11.7, the following site landscape standards apply to townhouse, multi-family dwelling and non-residential uses. 
A.  Areas of the site not covered by structures or pavement must be planted with live landscaping. 
B.  Decorative stone, brick, or pavement may be used for edging planting beds but may not cover more than 20% of the landscaped area. 
C.  A landscaped area must be located around the foundation perimeter of all buildings when visible from a public street. Such landscaping may be composed of a combination of shrubs, roses, ground cover, ornamental grasses, perennials, vines and annual flowers. Planted pots and/or planter boxes may be used to satisfy this requirement in tight and/or paved areas. This does not apply to structures that are sited 10 feet or less from the lot line, or where sidewalks, driveways, truck docks, and loading and service areas provide access to the building or where fire department connections are necessary. 
D.  Shade trees should be located on the south side of buildings wherever feasible to block summer sun. 
E.  Plantings shall be designed so as to provide massing of natural colors and shapes to offset the mass of the building and to provide visual relief from the straight lines of building architecture, parking lots, and other man-made features. The overuse of hybridized colored plantings (e.g., bright yellow & purple foliage) should be avoided. 
F.  Service yards and exterior work areas must be screened from view from adjacent residential and commercial districts and the public right-of-way. 
11.9 - BUFFER YARDS 
    This section establishes standards for the dimension and required landscape for buffer yards between land uses and/or zoning districts within the rear or interior side yard. Nothing in this section prevents the applicant's voluntary installation of buffer yards where they are not required. 
A.  As of the effective date of this Ordinance, buffer yards are required for new construction 1 [] along interior side and rear yards in the following cases: 
1.  Where an R-3 or R-4 District abuts a R-1, R-2, or R-2-35 District. This does not apply to single-family and two-family dwellings located within an R-3 or R-4 District. 
2.  Where a non-residential use is located within a residential district. This does not apply to parks. 
3.  Where a non-residential district abuts a residential district. This does not apply to parks. 
    B. Buffer yards may be located within required yards, but must be reserved for the planting of material and installation of screening as required by this section. No parking, driveways, sidewalks, accessory structures, or other impervious surfaces are permitted within the buffer yard area. 
    C. The required design of buffer yards is as follows: 
1.  A buffer yard must be a minimum of 10 feet in width. This requirement may be reduced or eliminated for smaller parcels by the Director of Community Development if it is demonstrated that a 10 foot wide buffer yard presents a hardship. 
2.  One shade tree must be planted for every 25 linear feet of buffer yard length. As part of the landscape plan approval, trees may be spaced at various intervals based on specific site requirements, but the total number of trees planted must be no less than one per 25 linear feet of buffer yard length. 
3.  Existing trees that are preserved may count toward the buffer yard tree requirement. This credit is a 1:1 ratio (one existing tree for one proposed tree) regardless of the size of the existing tree. 
4.  Unless otherwise specifically required by the use standards of this Ordinance, a solid fence or wall of six feet in height must be erected along 100% of the buffer yard length. 
5.  One shrub, measuring a minimum of 18 inches in height at planting and reaching a minimum of three feet in height at maturity, must be planted for every three linear feet of buffer yard length, spaced linearly. 
6.  70% of the landscape area outside of shrub and tree masses must be planted in live groundcover, perennials, or ornamental grasses. 

Footnotes: 
--- () --- 
Note- For example, new commercial construction next to an existing residential district must provide the buffer yard. Conversely, new residential construction next to an existing commercial district is not required to provide a buffer yard and is not considered nonconforming. 

11.10 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT BASIN LANDSCAPING 
    Storm water management basins must be designed as an integral part of the overall site plan, and should provide required storm water storage as well as desirable environmental functions and an aesthetically pleasing environment. 
A.  Storm water management basins should be designed as follows: 
1.  In permanently wet retention basins, emergent plantings must be incorporated to soften the shoreline, increase water quality, and provide wildlife habitat. The shoreline zone, consisting of an area from the normal water level to the top of the slope, around the entire perimeter, must be planted with suitable cover vegetation such as native grasses, sedges, forbs, or turf. 
a.  Maintained turf areas may be used within the shoreline zone to allow vehicle access for maintenance including, but not limited to, dredging equipment. Maintained turf must not constitute more than 30% of the area of the shoreline zone. 
2.  In dry-bottom or occasionally inundated detention basins, all areas of the basin, including the floor, side slopes, berms, impoundment structures, or other earth structures must be planted with turf grass or other cover vegetation specifically suited for storm water basins. Turf grass areas must be sodded or hydro-seeded to minimize erosion during the establishment period, and once established, should be maintained at a height of not more than six inches. Wildflowers, meadow plantings, and nonaggressive grasses suitable to the intermittently wet conditions of the detention basin are encouraged as alternatives to turf grass, provided that they provide continuous cover to all areas of the basin, and do not interfere in the safe and efficient function of the basin. 
3.  Storm water management basins are required to provide a buffer zone, extending 20 feet from the top of slope, around the entire perimeter of the basin. This area serves to buffer adjacent uses and to provide a transition to a development's overall landscape theme. Required plantings in the buffer zone may be grouped together or spaced as necessary to provide an aesthetically appealing transition to the surrounding landscape. Plantings in the buffer zone are required as follows: 
a.  A minimum of one deciduous tree is required for each 2,500 square feet of total buffer area. 
b.  A minimum of one evergreen tree is required for each 3,000 square feet of total buffer area. 
c.  A combination of deciduous and evergreen shrubs are required, at a minimum rate of one shrub for each 400 square feet of total buffer area. 
d.  The remainder of the buffer area must be planted with live groundcover, perennials, or ornamental grasses. 
e.  In the case that any of the above calculations result in a fraction, it must be rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
4.  Basins must incorporate curvilinear features to blend with and complement the natural surrounding topography. The use of sharp geometric shapes must be avoided. 
5.  Where appropriate, dry bottom or occasionally inundated storm water management basins should be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space, or other types of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. 
6.  Amenities, such as bike paths, sidewalks, gazebos, benches, and other such items are encouraged around storm water management basins. 
7.  All storm water management basins that can be expected to flood to a depth of three feet must have warning signs posted on all sides. 
B.  Maintenance should be considered at the time of designing a stormwater management basin. To make maintenance easier and less costly, designs should include the following features where applicable: 
1.  A discharge drain made of concrete or other durable materials other than corrugated metal. 
2.  A discharge drain located in the embankment with easy access for repair and debris removal. 
3.  Shoreline protection measures to prevent erosion from any potential wave action. 
4.  Facilities to allow the water level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. 
5.  Plant selections that consider the climate and other events likely to contribute to erosion, based on an evaluation of the risks, costs, and benefits involved. 
6.  Protection of natural vegetation wherever possible in areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses. 
C.  A maintenance bond will be held by the Village's Department of Community Development for a two year period following initial approval of the landscape plan. This must be equivalent to 25% of the vegetation and installation cost related to any storm water management basin, and will be collected to ensure sufficient establishment of the plants. The project sponsor must provide a written cost estimate or actual contract amount as a basis for the bond amount. 
D.  A management plan for storm water management basins must be provided to the Village at the time of site plan review. Any homeowner association covenants and restrictions or master deed must include language for detention basin maintenance per the approved plan. The Village may require establishment of a special service area for maintenance of the stormwater management basin. 
11.11 - STREET TREE REQUIREMENTS 
A.  For any project classified as new construction, Village street tree requirements as provided in Section 106 shall be met. 
(Ord. No. 2017-58, § 2(Exh. 1), 11-28-17) 
SECTION 12. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 

12.1 - PURPOSE 
    Planned unit developments (PUD) are allowed in this Ordinance as a distinct category of special use. The primary purpose of the planned unit development is to ensure that developments are consistent with the intent, purpose, and policies of the officially adopted Niles Comprehensive Plan. It is intended that planned unit developments will encourage the innovative land planning, architecture, landscape architecture, and site amenities beyond that which would be possible though the strict application of the Niles Zoning Ordinance and Niles Subdivision regulations. In particular, the planned unit development technique is intended to encourage and allow more creative and flexible development of land than is possible under district zoning regulations and should only be applied to further those applications that provide compensating amenities to the Village. The underlying district dimensional and use regulations apply to a PUD unless specifically modified through the approval process. Through the flexibility of the planned unit development technique, the planned unit development is intended achieve some or all of the following objectives: 
A.  Allow for the creation of projects with a variety of land uses to be developed as a unified project. 
B.  Ensure that developments meet the intent, purpose, and policies of the Village of Niles Comprehensive Plan. 
C.  Encourage innovation and creativity in the land planning and design process. 
D.  Preserve natural site amenities and features such as vegetation, topography, geologic features, environmentally sensitive areas, access to public lands, and other unique features of the site. 
E.  Encourage the availability of recreational opportunities and the preservation of open space. 
F.  Prevent and control soil erosion and surface flooding. 
G.  Create a method for the preservation of common open space for the continued use and enjoyment of residents within the development as well as village-wide. 
H.  Provide for the efficient location of institutions and public buildings and facilities. 
I.  Provide a process that encourages the innovative reuse and/or redevelopment of older under-performing properties. 
J.  Encourage flexibility in the development of land and in the design of structures. 
K.  Encourage a creative approach to the use of land that results in better development and design than might otherwise be accomplished under the strict application of other sections of this Ordinance. 
L.  Allow for the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally innovative, and that achieve better utilization of land than is possible through strict application of standard zoning controls. 
M.  Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and structural/visual relationships within an environment that allows mixing of different uses in an innovative and functionally efficient manner. 
N.  Provide for the efficient use of land to facilitate a more effective arrangement of land uses, structures, circulation patterns, and utilities. 
O.  Encourage land development that, to the greatest extent possible, preserves natural vegetation, respects natural topographic and geologic conditions, and refrains from adversely affective flooding, soil, drainage, and other natural ecologic conditions. 
P.  Facilitate the implementation of adopted Village land use policies, particularly with respect to areas planned for potential redevelopment. 
12.2 - INITIATION 
    The entire property proposed for the planned unit development must be in single ownership or under unified control. All owners of the property must be included as joint applicants on all applications and all approvals will bind all owners. A minimum of one acre is required for a planned unit development proposal. 
12.3 - AUTHORIZATION 
    A planned unit development is authorized as a special use in the zoning districts (see Section 8). A planned unit development must be granted in accordance with the procedures and standards of this Section and the special use provisions of Section 15. Unless specifically approved as part of the planned unit development and special use approval, the requirements of the underlying district apply. 
12.4 - EXCEPTIONS FROM DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
A.  The planned unit development is subject to the underlying district dimensional and use regulations unless an exception is specifically granted. The Planning and Zoning Board may recommend and the Village Board may grant exceptions to the zoning district use and dimensional regulations where a planned unit development is located. Exceptions from district regulations may be granted for planned unit developments, if the exceptions: 
1.  Enhance the overall merit of the planned unit development. 
2.  Promote the objectives of both the Village and the development. 
3.  Enhance the quality of the design of the structures and the site plan. 
4.  Will not cause such an adverse impact on neighboring properties so as to outweigh the benefits of the development. 
5.  Are compatible with adopted Village land use policies. 
6.  Provide a public benefit to the Village, as described below. 
B.  The underlying zoning district requirements apply, unless an exception is granted as part of the planned unit development and special use approval. Exceptions to district regulations may be granted where it is determined that such modifications do not negatively affect the value and enjoyment of surrounding property, the provision of municipal services, or traffic circulation on-site and off-site. To be granted such exceptions, the applicant must demonstrate superior design and enhanced amenities. In no case may an exception to district regulations be granted unless the applicant demonstrates a substantial benefit to the Village. Design characteristics and amenities to be considered in this determination include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Community amenities including plazas, malls, formal gardens, places to congregate, outdoor seating, public art, and pedestrian and public transit facilities.

15.3 - SPECIAL USE 
A.  Purpose 
This Ordinance is based upon the division of the Village into districts. Within each district the use of land and structures are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in a particular district or districts without consideration of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. 
B.  Initiation 
A property owner in the Village, or his/her designee, may file an application to use his/her land for one or more of the special uses authorized within the zoning district. A property owner may only propose a special use for property under his/her control. 
C.  Authority 
The Village Board, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Board, will take formal action on special use applications. 
D.  Procedure

The Village Board may take action in the form of approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the special use, remand the issue back to the Planning and Zoning Board for further consideration, or table the discussion until a future meeting of the Village Board 
3.  Conditions on Special Uses 
The Planning and Zoning Board may recommend, and the Village Board may impose, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the special use as may be deemed necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. The Village Board may require such guarantees, as it may deem necessary, to assure compliance with any stipulated conditions. 
E.  Approval Standards 
The listing of a use as a special use within a zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such special use will be approved. Rather, each special use must be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to all applicable standards of this Ordinance. Such evaluation will determine whether approval of the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner proposed. The recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board and decision of the Village Board must be based on findings to support each of the following conclusions: 
1.  The special use in the specific location proposed is consistent with the spirit and intent of this Ordinance, the adopted Comprehensive Plan and other adopted Village land use policies. 
2.  The proposed special use will not endanger the public health, safety, or welfare. 
3.  The proposed special use is compatible with the general land use of adjacent properties and other property within the immediate vicinity. 
4.  The proposed special use is deemed necessary for the public convenience at the proposed location. 
F.  Modifications to Approved Special Uses 
Any modifications to the conditions of approval for a previously approved special use must be resubmitted as a new special use application. Any modifications that meet Ordinance standards are permitted, subject to the regulations of this Ordinance. 
G.  Expiration 
1.  A special use approval expires if any one of the following conditions occurs and no request for an extension of the special use approval is pending: 
a.  When an approved special use is changed to another use. 
b.  For special uses approved in conjunction with new construction or additions or enlargements to an existing structure, the special use approval expires within one year of the date of approval if a building permit has not been issued, subject to 2. below. 
c.  For special uses approved in conjunction with an existing structure or on a lot where no structure is planned, the special use approval expires within one year of the date of approval if the structure or site have remained vacant or if the special use has not commenced, subject to Section '2' below. 
d.  For special uses approved in conjunction with a preliminary plan for a planned unit development, the special use approval expires in conjunction with the preliminary plan expiration. 
2.  In the event that a lawsuit or other legal challenge is filed against an approved special use permit, the calculation of the one-year time limit for the expiration of that special use is suspended from the date the lawsuit or legal challenge is filed until a final decision, after any and all appeals, is rendered. 
H.  Revocation 
1.  A special use permit may be revoked for cause by the Village Board of Trustees, after a public hearing held in front of the Planning and Zoning Board. 
2.  Notice of the public hearing shall be provided in writing to the owner of the property no fewer than 15 days and no more than 30 days before the public hearing. 
3.  The owner of the property shall be given the opportunity to discuss the proposed revocation of the special use permit at the public hearing.

F.  Expiration of Variation 
An approved variation will expire one year from the date of approval unless a building permit is obtained or applied for within such period. Variations which do not entail a building permit, such as parking variations, expire when the use for which the parking variation was granted is discontinued. The Director of Community Development may grant an extension for a period of validity longer than one year, so long as the applicant applies in writing for an extension of time at any time prior to the date of expiration.

SECTION 16. - NONCONFORMITIES 

16.1 - GENERAL APPLICABILITY 
A.  Authority to Continue 
Any structure, lot, or use that legally existed as a nonconformity as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and any structure, lot, or use that has been made nonconforming as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and any subsequent amendments, may continue subject to the provisions of this Section so long as it remains otherwise legal. 
B.  Burden on Property Owner 
The burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity under the provisions of this Ordinance is the responsibility of the property owner of the nonconforming structure or lot, or the operator of the nonconforming use. 
C.  Safety Regulations 
All police power regulations enacted to promote public health, safety, and welfare including, but not limited to, all building, fire, and health codes, apply to nonconformities. 
16.2 - NONCONFORMING USE 
A.  Definition 
A nonconforming use is the use of a structure or lot that at one time was an allowed use within a zoning district, but because of subsequent amendments to the Ordinance is no longer allowed. 
B.  Expansion 
A nonconforming use of a structure or lot cannot be expanded, extended, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity includes additions or enlargements of any structure devoted to a nonconforming use that increases the intensity of a nonconforming use, and any expansion, extension, or relocation of a nonconforming use to any additional floor area, any lot area currently not occupied by such nonconforming use, or any other structure on the lot. 
C.  Relocation 
A nonconforming use of a structure or lot cannot be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot. The nonconforming use may only be relocated to another structure or lot if the use conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is relocated. 
D.  Change of Use 
A nonconforming use cannot be changed to any use other than one allowed within the zoning district where it is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed, in whole or in part, to an allowed use, the whole or part that conforms cannot be changed back to the nonconforming use. A change of use occurs when an existing nonconforming use has been terminated and another use has commenced. Any change in use in violation of this Ordinance is deemed an abandonment of the previously existing nonconforming use. 
E.  Discontinuation or Abandonment 
If a nonconforming use is discontinued or the structure or lot that it occupies becomes vacant and remains unoccupied for a continuous period of 180 days, the nonconforming use is deemed abandoned and cannot be reestablished or resumed regardless of intent. Any subsequent use of such structure or lot must comply with all regulations of the zoning district in which the structure or lot is located. A period of discontinuance caused by acts of God or other events without any contributing fault by the user are not included in calculating the length of discontinuance for this section. 
F.  Damage or Destruction 
In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is structurally damaged or destroyed, the following apply. 
1.  If the structure prior to the damage or destruction complied with all standards of this Ordinance: 
a.  In the event that any structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement value at the time, then the nonconforming use may not be re-established. 
b.  When such a structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of less than 50% of the replacement value at the time, then the nonconforming use may be re-established provided that no new nonconformities are created. A building permit must be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair, or reconstruction within one year of the date of damage or destruction. In the event that the building permit is not obtained within one year, then the nonconforming use cannot be re-established. 
c.  The replacement value of the structure is based on: 1) the sale of that structure within the previous year or, if that is not applicable; 2) an appraisal within the last two years or, if that is not available; 3) the amount for which the structure was insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction; or, 4) an alternative method determined acceptable by the Village. 
2.  If the structure prior to the damage or destruction was a nonconforming structure: 
a.  The provisions of item 1 apply in terms of permitting the re-establishment of the nonconforming use. 
b.  The provisions of Section 16.3 apply to reconstruction of a nonconforming structure. 
16.3 - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE 
A.  Definition 
A nonconforming structure is a principal or accessory structure that at one time conformed to applicable zoning regulations, but because of subsequent amendments to the Ordinance no longer conforms to applicable dimensional regulations. However, certain structures are considered site elements, such as fences and exterior lighting, and are regulated by Section 16.5. 
B.  Maintenance 
Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed on any nonconforming structure. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously existing nonconformity. 
C.  Structural Alterations 
Structural alterations are permitted on nonconforming structures in the following situations: 
1.  When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting public safety. 
2.  When the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity. 
3.  When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing nonconformity. (For example, if a structure is nonconforming in terms of the required front setback in that it does not meet the required minimum, the structure may add a rear addition if it meets all other dimensional regulations of the district.) 
D.  Relocation 
A nonconforming structure cannot be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot unless such relocation would make the structure conforming. A nonconforming structure may be relocated to another lot if the structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is relocated. 
E.  Damage or Destruction 
1.  In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement value at the time, then the structure may not be restored or rebuilt unless the structure, including foundation, conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
2.  When such a structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of less than 50% of the replacement value at the time, it may be repaired and reconstructed provided that no new nonconformities are created and that the existing degree of the nonconformity is not increased. A building permit must be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair, or reconstruction within eighteen (18) months of the date of damage or destruction. In the event that the building permit is not obtained within eighteen (18) months, then the structure cannot be restored unless it conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is located. 
3.  The replacement value of the structure is based on: 1) the sale of that structure within the previous year or, if that is not applicable; 2) an appraisal within the last two years or, if that is not available; 3) the amount for which the structure was insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction; or, 4) an alternative method determined acceptable by the Village. 
F.  Extension of Walls for Nonconforming Single-Family and Two-Family Dwellings 
Where a single-family or two-family dwelling is deemed nonconforming because of encroachment into the required interior side or rear yard by 20% or less of that required by the district, the structure may be enlarged or extended vertically or horizontally along the same plane as defined by the existing perimeter walls, so long as the resulting structure does not increase the degree of the existing nonconformity or otherwise violate this Ordinance. 
16.4 - NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD 
A.  Definition 
A nonconforming lot of record is a lot of record that at one time conformed to the lot dimension requirements of the zoning district in which it is located, but because of subsequent amendments to the Ordinance no longer conforms to the applicable lot dimensions. 
B.  Use 
1.  Individual Nonconforming Lots of Record in Residential Districts. 
In residential districts, a single family dwelling may be constructed and maintained on a lot which is nonconforming as to minimum lot area and/or minimum lot width, if the lot was of record on the date of the adoption of the Village of Niles zoning ordinance-December 1, 1936, was in separate ownership on the effective date of this Title, and conforms to all other requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
2.  Nonconforming Lots of Record Held in Common Ownership in Residential Districts. 
If on the date of the adoption of the Village of Niles zoning ordinance-December 1, 1936, there are two (2) or more lots of record with contiguous frontage in single ownership, and one or more of the lots is non-conforming as to the minimum lot area and/or minimum lot width, the lots shall be considered to be a single undivided parcel for the purposes of this Title. 
A)  No portion of said single undivided parcel shall be conveyed which does not meet the lot width and lot area requirements established by this Title. No division of said undivided parcel shall be made which leaves the remaining lot(s) with lot width or lot area below the requirements of this Title. 
a.  No building permit shall be issued for the use of any lot or portion of a lot, transferred or conveyed in violation of this Section. 
B)  The entirety of said undivided parcel shall be treated as a non-conforming lot per section 1 above. 
3.  A nonconforming lot of record in a non-residential district may be used for any permitted or special use allowed in the district so long as it complies with all other dimensional requirements of the district. 
C.  Development 
Development of a nonconforming lot of record must meet all applicable dimensional regulations of the district in which it is located. 
D.  Common Ownership Limitation 
1.  If two or more abutting lots of record have contiguous frontage in common ownership as of the effective date of this Ordinance and one or more of the lots does not meet the requirements for lot area or width as established by this Ordinance, the abutting lots involved are considered to be a single zoning lot for the purposes of this Ordinance. 
2.  No portion of such zoning lot as described in item 1 can be used, transferred, or conveyed if it does not meet the lot width and lot area requirements established by this Ordinance. No division of such zoning lot as described in item 1 is permitted which will leave one or more lots of record resulting from such division nonconforming. 
3.  No building permit will be issued for the use of any lot, or portion of a lot, transferred or conveyed in violation of this Ordinance. 
16.5 - NONCONFORMING SITE ELEMENTS 
A.  Definition 
A nonconforming site element is a site development element, such as landscape, lighting, or parking, that at one time conformed to the requirements of this Ordinance, but because of subsequent amendments, has been made nonconforming. 
B.  Maintenance 
Normal maintenance and incidental repair to a nonconforming site element may be performed. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously existing nonconformity. 
C.  Required Conformance 
All nonconforming site elements must be brought into conformance when the following occurs: 
1.  All Nonconforming Site Elements 
a.  A new principal structure is constructed on a site 
b.  An existing principal structure is increased in total gross floor area by 30% or more. 
2.  Nonconforming Parking Lots 
a.  An existing parking lot of 15 or more spaces is fully reconstructed or an existing parking lot of 10 or more spaces is expanded by 50% (based on number of spaces). Resurfacing an existing parking lot which entails grinding-out and replacing less than two and one-half (2 1/2) inches of existing pavement and does not change the stone sub-base or the existing grading is not considered reconstruction, nor is resealing or re-striping of an existing parking lot considered to be reconstruction. 
b.  When an existing parking lot is required to provide landscape, which would result in creating a parking area that no longer conforms to the parking regulations of this Ordinance, such existing parking lot is not required to install all or a portion of the required landscape. The applicant is required to show that landscape cannot be accommodated on the site. If only certain requirements can be accommodated on the site, then only those elements are required. The Director of Community Development will make the determination that all or a portion of required landscape does not have to be installed. 
3.  Nonconforming Exterior Lighting 
For exterior lighting, nonconforming luminaires must be brought into conformance when 25% of the illumination system is to be replaced or modified, calculated as installation of new lighting posts and/or non-post mounted lighting fixtures. This 25% is calculated based on the total lighting installed by type of mounting. For example, if over 25% of the wall-mounted fixtures are to be replaced, all wall-mounted fixtures must be brought into conformance while freestanding fixtures may remain. 
Non-conforming parking lot lighting which includes only the replacement of the lamp and which meets ordinance requirements for intensity and for shielding shall be allowed on existing poles at existing mounting heights and shall not be required to be lowered to meet new ordinance requirements. 
SECTION 17. - ENFORCEMENT 

17.1 - ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL 
    This Ordinance is enforced by the Director of Community Development. The Director of Community Development may secure the assistance of the Village Attorney to seek an injunction, abatement, or other appropriate actions to enjoin, abate, or stop any violation of this Ordinance. At times, the aid of the Police Department may be sought to enforce this Ordinance. The property owner charged with the violation may be held responsible for any legal expenses incurred by the Village. 
17.2 - APPLICATION OF PENALTIES 
    Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Ordinance, upon conviction, will be fined for each offense. Each day that a violation continues constitutes a separate offense for the purposes of the penalties and remedies available to the Village. The accumulation of penalties for violations, but not the obligation for payment for violations already committed, ceases upon correction of the violation. 
17.3 - FINES 
    Each violation and each day that such violation continues is subject to a fine as established in the Village Code.
