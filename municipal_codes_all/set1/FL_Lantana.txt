PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the Town of Lantana of a general and permanent nature. The Code supersedes all ordinances of the town not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Town. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the town Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 3 is 3-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 8 and 9 it will be designated as Chapter 8.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publishers are most grateful to Paul Nicoletti and Trela E. White, Town Attorneys and other members of the town's staff, for their cooperation and assistance and for the interest shown by them in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication. Credit is gratefully acknowledged also to the members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout this project.

The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on your property. If you sell or lease such building within 1 year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances.

SECTION 114 
VIOLATIONS 
Any person, firm, corporation or agent who shall violate a provision of this code, or fail to comply therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, or who shall erect, construct, alter, install, demolish or move any structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, or has erected, constructed, altered, repaired, moved or demolished a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, without full compliance with applicable codes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, shall be found in violation of this code. Each such person shall be considered in violation of a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of the provisions of applicable codes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations is committed or continued, and upon a finding of any such violation such person shall be punished within the limits and as provided by state laws. Nothing in this section shall prevent the authority having jurisdiction from imposing fines, liens, or seek injunction relief, or exercising other enforcement powers as permitted by law. Code enforcement and penalties of 162 Florida Statutes Part I shall be authorized if building work begins without payment of all required fees, and for the purposes of enforcing this code, code officials licensed under Florida Statute 468 Part XII are deemed "Code Inspectors", as defined in Florida Statute 162.04. 
SECTION 115 
STOP WORK ORDER 
115.1 Stop work orders. Upon notice from the building official, work on any building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system that is being done contrary to the provisions of this code or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall immediately cease.

Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall immediately cease.

Where an emergency exists, the building official shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work. 
115.3 Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall be subject to penalties as prescribed by law. 
SECTION 116 
UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT 
116.1 Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems. All such unsafe buildings, structures or service systems are hereby declared illegal and shall be ordered by the building official to be abated by the owner, through repair and rehabilitation or by demolition in accordance with the this Code. The extent of repairs shall be determined by the building official. 
116.1.1 When the building official determines a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof is unsafe, as set forth in this Code he/she shall provide the owner, agent or person in control of such building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system a written notice of violation stating the defects thereof. This notice shall require the owner within a stated time either to complete specified repairs or improvements, or to demolish and remove the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof. At the option of the local government, the processes and procedures for code enforcement under Florida Statute 162 may be utilized to abate a violation under this section. If this statutory method of enforcement is invoked, the building official, or authorized designee, shall act in the role of code inspector as authorized in Section 104 of this code to initiate enforcement proceedings, and notice shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Statute. 
116.1.2 If necessary, the notice shall also require the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing systems or portion thereof to be vacated and/or disconnected, and not reoccupied and/or reconnected until the specified repairs and improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the building official. The building official shall post at each entrance to the building a placard stating: THIS BUILDING IS UNSAFE AND ITS USE OR OCCUPANCY HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE BUILDING OFFICIAL. This placard shall remain posted until the required repairs are made or demolition is completed. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation or its officers, agents, or other servants, to remove the posting without written permission of the building official, or for any person to enter the building, or use the building or system(s) except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing same. 
116.1.3 In case the owner, agent, or person in control cannot be found within the stated time limit, or, if such owner, agent, or person in control shall fail, neglect, or refuse to comply with notice to repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish, and remove said building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof, the building official, acting as a code inspector, shall notify an enforcement board and request a hearing. In the case of the violation posing a serious threat, and after having ascertained the cost, the building official may take action to cause such building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof, to be demolished, secured, repaired, or required to remain vacant or unused. Taking such action does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the building official to continue with maintaining such building, structure, or system; or create liability for any damage to the property. 
116.1.4 The decision of the building official shall be final in cases of emergency, which, in the opinion of the building official, involve imminent danger to human life or health, or the property of others. He/she shall promptly cause such building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof to be made safe or cause its removal. For this purpose he/she may at once enter such structure or land on which it stands, or abutting land or structures, with such assistance and at such cost as he may deem necessary. He/she may order the vacating of adjacent structures and may require the protection of the public by appropriate fence or such other means as may be necessary, and for this purpose may close a public or private way. 
116.2 Enforcement proceedings; hearings. Violation proceedings and hearings for unsafe structures and equipment will be conducted before the code enforcement board or special magistrate in accordance with the provisions set forth in Florida Statute 162. The owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, special magistrate, or court is required to make disclosures as outlined in Florida Statute 162 before a transfer of property, and failure to make the required disclosures creates a presumption of fraud. 
116.3 Administrative fines; costs to repair; liens. All costs associated with taking a case before the enforcement board shall be recovered where the jurisdiction prevails. Whenever one of the orders of the enforcement board or the special magistrate has not been complied with by the time set for compliance, for each day thereafter during which each violation continues past the date set for compliance, the enforcement board or the special magistrate may impose a fine. All costs incurred as a result of actions taken per Section 116.1.3 are charged to the violator. A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair, and the costs of prosecuting the case, may be recorded in the public records and shall thereafter constitute a lien against the land where the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection, and it has been complied with by the date subsequent to the recording of the order, the enforcement board or special magistrate may issue an order releasing such lien that shall be recorded in the public record. A hearing is not required for the issuance of such recorded document. 
116.4 Appeal. An aggrieved party, including the local governing body, may appeal a final administrative order of an enforcement board or special magistrate to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the enforcement board. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
SECTION 117 
VARIANCES IN FLOOD HAZARD AREAS 
117.1 Flood hazard areas.

Sec. 6-101. - Floodplain ordinance. 
    The town council of the Town of Lantana hereby adopts the Floodplain Management Ordinance through the adoption of the following chapters and sections generally conforming to the format of the Florida Building Code which is referenced therein. Further administrative amendments to Chapter 1. Administration, of the Florida Building Code related to Floodplain Management Ordinance may also be found at section 6-17 of the Town Code. 
CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION 
SECTION 101 GENERAL 
101.1 Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the Town of Lantana, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." These regulations are arranged to reflect the organization of the Florida Building Code (2010), with administrative provisions in Chapter 1, definitions in Chapter 2, and technical provisions in Chapter 3. 
101.2 Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
101.3 Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
2.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
3.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
4.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
7.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
8.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
101.4 Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
101.5 Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60, may be revised by Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance. 
101.6 Disclaimer of Liability. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Town Council of the Town of Lantana or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
SECTION 102 APPLICABILITY 
102.1 General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
102.2 Areas to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the Town of Lantana as established in Section 102.3 of this ordinance. 
102.3 Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Lantana dated October 5, 2017, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this ordinance and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the office of the Town Clerk. 
102.3.1 Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to Section 105 of this ordinance the Floodplain Administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
1.  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this ordinance and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
2.  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a Letter of Map Change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
102.4 Other laws. The provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
102.5 Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances, including but not limited to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This ordinance shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this ordinance. 
102.6 Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

6.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
7.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
8.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
10.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
107.7 Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
1.  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
2.  Determination by the Construction Board of Adjustments and Appeals that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
4.  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. 
SECTION 108 VIOLATIONS 
108.1 Violations. Any development that is not within the scope of the Florida Building Code but that is regulated by this ordinance, that is performed without an issued permit, that is in conflict with an issued permit, or that does not fully comply with this ordinance or the Florida Building Code, as applicable, shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance.

Sec. 7.5-16. - Purpose; generally. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of these purchasing regulations is to: 
(1)  Provide a uniform means of acquiring goods and services in a manner which protects the interests of taxpayers; 
(2)  Ensure that qualified vendors have access to the municipal market on a fair and equitable basis; 
(3)  Apply the regulations to all purchases of the town irrespective of the source of funding; and 
(4)  Provide guidelines to user departments; 
(b)  Role of department heads. The town has a decentralized purchasing system, which empowers the department heads most familiar with their operations to acquire the goods and services they need, so long as the town council has appropriated adequate funds for the purchase. 
(c)  Finance department. The finance department serves as the purchasing gateway to provide assistance and technical expertise in purchasing procedures, and to ascertain that user departments understand and comply with established budgetary, purchasing and accounting procedures for overall internal control. No town employee shall order goods or services without the required authorization, funding, purchasing/finance documents and/or without complying with the terms of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. O-05-06, § 1(Exh. A), 9-11-06)

(Ord. No. O-05-06, § 1(Exh. A), 9-11-06) 
Sec. 7.5-18. - Bid specifications. 
(a)  Preparation. The preparation of specifications is the responsibility of the user department. Specifications are important and are intended to promote competition among vendors. Specifications should be written in terms which define the performance required or the design of the goods/services, rather than using specific brand names. Specifications should be clear and concise, and they should provide complete and detailed descriptions of the item(s) and/or services(s) being solicited, including quantity of items and/or dates of contractual services. 
(b)  Additional information required. If the goods or services desired are outside the expertise of the department personnel and specifications cannot be prepared by the department, the department head may contact prospective bidders with a written request for information and request recommended solutions to provide town staff with an adequate understanding to prepare the specifications. Prospective bidders and town personnel are not permitted to discuss pricing during this process. 
(c)  Bid package contents. In addition to the specifications, the bid package must contain the specific instructions and information to potential bidders. The bid package must: 
(1)  State the time, date and place where bids will be received. 
(2)  State evaluation criteria and the time line that will be used to determine the best bidder. 
(3)  Provide standard bid language to address Public Entity Crimes Act; drug-free work place; and non-discrimination.

(a)  Definition. Bid security is a document, usually in an amount of five (5) percent of the bid, which guarantees that the bidder will enter into a contract with the town if he/she wins the award. Bid security protects the town from erroneous or deliberate low bids which the vendor has no intention of honoring or performing within the time frame specified. 
(b)  Requirement for same. Each bid, where so required in the bid documents, must be accompanied by a bid bond, a cashier's check or a certified bank check in an amount of not less than five (5) percent of the total bid amount. The applicable bid documents will specify the details of individual bid requirements. Unless otherwise stated in the bid documents, the bid security of the successful bidder will be retained by the finance director, until such bidder has executed and furnished to the town, an agreement and required contract security. Upon receipt of the executed agreement and contract security, the bid security will be returned. If the successful bidder fails to execute and deliver the agreement and fails to furnish the contract security within the time required by the bid documents, after the notice of award, the town may cancel the notice of award and the bid security of that bidder shall be forfeited. The bid security of other bidders whom the town believes to have a reasonable chance of receiving the award may be retained by the town until the time specified in the bid documents. Bid security for bids which are not competitive will be returned within seven (7) days after the bid opening.

Unless otherwise approved by the town manager, in writing, the advertisement shall be placed in a newspaper of general circulation within the area and on the town's website. All advertisements shall provide a reasonable time for potential bidders to respond. Nothing herein shall prevent the town clerk or affected department head from directly sending an invitation to bid to known potential bidders. However, town officers and employees shall not disclose or use any information not available to the public for personal benefit of themselves or others.

(b)  Sole criteria. Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this chapter. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include additional criteria to determine suitability for a particular purpose. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in this chapter or the invitation for bids.

Sec. 7.5-23. - Addition, correction, cancellation, or withdrawal of bids. 
(a)  Addition to bids. After bid opening, an otherwise low bidder shall not be permitted to delete exceptions to bid conditions or specifications which affect price or substantive obligations. However, such bidder shall be permitted to furnish other information requested by the town so long as it was called for by the invitation for bids and does not affect responsiveness as set forth below. 
(1)  Information required to determine the responsibility of the vendor. 
(2)  Information shall not be considered after the bid opening if such information was specifically requested in the invitation for bids or if it is determined that the omission of such information renders the bid unresponsive. The bid shall be considered responsive only if it substantially conforms to requirements of the invitation for bids as it relates to pricing, surety, insurance, specifications, and any other matter unequivocally stated in the invitation for bids as a determinant of responsiveness. A minor or non-substantive lack of conformity on these matters may be considered a technicality or irregularity which may be waived by the authority empowered to make the award. 
(b)  Correction on bids. 
(1)  Mathematical errors. Errors in extension of unit prices or mathematical calculations may be corrected by the finance director prior to award. The unit prices shall not be changed. 
(2)  Clerical errors. A bidder shall be permitted to correct clerical mistakes of fact in their bid. 
(3)  Voluntary reduction of price. The town may accept a voluntary reduction from a low bidder after bid opening, if such reduction is not conditioned on, nor results in, the modification or deletion of any condition contained in the invitation for bids. A voluntary reduction may not be used to ascertain the lowest responsive, responsible bidder. 
(c)  Cancellation of bids. 
(1)  Any time prior to bid opening date and time, the town may cancel or postpone the bid opening or cancel the invitation for bid in its entirety. 
(2)  After bids are open, any or all bids may be rejected by the town. 
(d)  Withdrawal of bids. 
(1)  Any bidder may voluntarily withdraw or amend his bid at any time prior to the bid opening by providing written notice to the town. Amendments should be forwarded to the town clerk, sealed and identified. 
(2)  After bid opening, vendors shall not be allowed to withdraw a bid in less than ninety (90) days, or such specific time period stated in the invitation to bid with the following exception: the bid is so outrageous as to be a prima facie evidence of a bid mistake, but a mistake that cannot be corrected by correction of mathematical computation.

(Ord. No. O-05-06, § 1(Exh. A), 9-11-06) 
Sec. 7.5-45. - Conflict of interest. 
(a)  Generally. The appearance of a conflict can be as damaging as a real conflict of interest. All questions concerning conflicts of interest or gifts should be directed to the town manager or the finance director, as soon as they arise. Any employee actions or contacts with vendors or potential vendors, or the offer or acceptance of otherwise permissible gifts which a reasonable person would perceive as advancing personal interests, regardless of actual intent, can give rise to the appearance of impropriety. 
(b)  Insider information. Providing insider or privileged information to select vendors which may provide them an unfair advantage in the purchasing or bidding process, is prima facie evidence of a violation of this chapter. 
(c)  Financial gain. 
(1)  It shall be unethical for any town employee to participate directly or indirectly in a procurement contract when the employee knows that: 
a.  The employee or any member of the employee's immediate family has a financial interest in the procurement contract; or 
b.  Any other person, business, or organization with whom the employee or any member of a employee's immediate is negotiating or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment is involved in the procurement contract;

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 10.5-1. - Generally. 
(a)  Declaration of legislative intent. It is the purpose and intent of the town council to promote the health, safety and welfare of existing and future residents of and visitors to the Town of Lantana by establishing minimum standards for the installation and continued maintenance of landscaping on all property within the town in order to: 
(1)  Improve and preserve the aesthetic appearance of residential neighborhoods and commercial and mixed-use properties to ensure attractive streetscapes and vistas throughout the town in order to promote a more pleasant environment; 
(2)  Improve environmental quality by recognizing and encouraging the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment, including: 
a.  The improvement of air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; 
b.  Maintaining the ability of the soils to contribute to aquifer recharge; 
c.  Reducing and reversing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacity of trees and other vegetation; 
d.  Promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade, the reduction of heat gain in or on buildings and paved areas, and reducing the temperature of the micro-climate through the process of evapotranspiration; 
e.  Reducing the erosion of soils; 
f.  Reducing surface velocity of winds; and 
g.  Other beneficial effects; 
(3)  Maintain and enhance property values by camouflaging the harsh outlines of masonry, metal and glass construction materials; providing for increased economic value by serving as a capital asset when properly incorporated into site design; providing for an attractive, landscaped appearance of commercial, industrial, residential, and mixed-use areas; and providing for buffering of incompatible land uses; 
(4)  Encourage the preservation of acceptable existing native vegetation and conserving natural ecosystems by incorporating these into the landscape design and encourage the utilization of "Xeriscape" landscaping techniques, whenever possible; 
(5)  Encourage the eradication or control of certain enumerated exotic plant species which have become nuisances because of their tendency to damage public and private improvements or to destroy native ecosystems; encourage sound development and forestry practices, in particular with respect to tree protection, and discourage poor land development practices such as speculative grubbing, razing or clear cutting of lots when no bona fide site development plans have been prepared; 
(6)  Establish minimum landscaping standards and criteria for all development within the town; 
(7)  Implement the goals, objectives and polices of the comprehensive plan; and 
(8)  Promote the conservation of irrigation water through the utilization of "Xeriscape" principles. 
(b)  Applicability. The landscape regulations set forth in this chapter shall apply to the following properties. Additionally, all properties in the town which have installed landscaping, if not specifically included in the listing set forth hereinbelow, shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Articles II and III, except for sections 10.5-21 and 10.5-22. 
(1)  All new construction; 
(2)  Property where there exists a change of use or where any new use is begun or structure constructed in lieu of any previously non-conforming use or structure which has been discontinued for a period of more than six (6) months; 
(3)  Property where landscape-related work of over two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) in value is initiated, either for new landscaping or for landscape renovations; 
(4)  Property where a renovation of an existing structure is valued at twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or more; 
(5)  Property previously approved for site plans or development orders (either developed or undeveloped) which subsequently receives approval from the town for revisions to increase the number of residential units by twenty-five (25) percent or increases the gross square footage of non-residential uses by twenty-five (25) percent. 
(c)  Exemptions. Exemptions may be allowed from certain requirements only as specifically set forth in this chapter. 
(d)  No increase in nonconformity. No existing property shall be permitted to increase the degree of nonconformity as it pertains to this chapter. 
(e)  Permits required. Permits shall be required for the following landscape related activities (the cost of such permits shall be established by resolution of the town council): 
(1)  The removal of any tree on any property within the town limits. 
(2)  Activities related to protected trees as outlined in section 10.5-4 of this chapter.

(Ord. No. O-15-05, § 1, 9-26-05) 
Sec. 10.5-23. - In general. 
(a)  Plant selection (plant palette) and placement. The selection of plants to be included in the plant palette should be based on the plant's adaptability to the existing conditions present at the landscaped area (Lantana is in hardiness zone 10a) and, soil type and moisture conditions, light, mature plant size, desired effect, color and texture. Plant species that are drought and freeze tolerant are recommended. Plants shall be grouped in accordance with their respective water and maintenance needs. Plants with similar water and cultural (soil, climate, sun, and light) requirements shall be grouped together. The water use zones (hydrozones) shall be shown on the landscape and irrigation plans. 
    With the exception of areas used for permissible driveways or sidewalks leading to a structure on the property, all required setback areas shall be landscaped, planted and maintained with a combination of sod, flowerbeds, shrubs, hedges and ground cover not to exceed three (3) feet in height; and trees which shall be planted so as not to obscure vision of traffic. All swales shall be sodded; no trees or other plant material shall be allowed in swale areas except upon approval by the town. (See Art. II. of Chap. 17 for additional swale regulations). Furthermore, the town encourages the use of "Xeriscape" in the planning and planting of landscaping following seven fundamental practices. Xeriscape is meant to be accomplished by: 
(1)  Planning and designing the landscaping for water conservation and beauty from the start; 
(2)  Creating practical turf areas of manageable sizes, shapes, and using appropriate grasses; 
(3)  Selecting low water requiring plants and grouping plants of similar water needs together; and then experimenting to determine how much and how often to water the plants; 
(4)  Using soil amendments if needed on the particular site and/or with the plant palette; 
(5)  Using mulches, such as woodchips, in order to reduce evaporation and to keep the soil cool; 
(6)  Irrigating efficiently with properly designed systems (including hose-end equipment) and applying the right amount of water at the right time; and 
(7)  Maintaining the landscape properly by mowing, weeding, pruning and fertilizing. 
(b)  Installation and phasing . All landscaping shall be installed according to acceptable industry standards in a manner designed to encourage vigorous growth. Soil improvement measures may be required to ensure healthy plant growth. A plant or tree's growth characteristics shall be considered before planting to prevent conflicts with buildings, views, lighting, utility lines (overhead and underground) or signage. All plants (including turf) require watering during establishment. Temporary irrigation facilities may be installed to facilitate establishment. Required landscaping may be installed in phases as follows. 
(1)  Planned developments. The number of trees required to be planted or preserved in a construction phase of a planned development, shall be a proportion of the total number of trees required to be planted in the overall planned development. This proportion shall be determined by comparing the area of the phase plan to the area of the entire planned development as shown on its current, controlling preliminary development plan. Areas of vegetation required to be preserved shall be excluded from the calculation of the area of a phase or subdivision plan of the planned development. 
(2)  Other developments. The entire perimeter landscaping shall be installed for residential and nonresidential developments, prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy or completion or in accordance with an approved phasing plan by the PRC. 
(3)  Preserved areas. Areas of vegetations that are to be preserved must be protected during site construction through the use of appropriate protection devices, such as tapes, fences, or other barriers. 
(c)  Maintenance. Proper landscape and irrigation maintenance will preserve and enhance a quality landscape and help to ensure water-efficiency. The land owner or successors in interest, or tenant or agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the following. 
(1)  Regular maintenance of all landscaping in a way that presents a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. All landscaping shall be maintained free from disease, pests, weeds and litter. This maintenance shall include weeding, watering, fertilizing, pruning, mowing, edging, mulching, pest control, or other maintenance, as needed and in accordance with acceptable horticultural practices. In no case shall turf and/or grass be permitted to grow to a height greater than twelve (12) inches. 
(2)  The maintenance of required landscape structures (e.g., walls, fences) in a structurally sound condition. 
(3)  The regular maintenance, repair, or replacement, where necessary, of landscape barriers required by this section. 
(4)  Perpetual maintenance to prohibit the reestablishment of prohibited and non-native invasive species within landscaping and preservation areas. 
(5)  Continuous maintenance of the site. 
(6)  All trees shall be allowed to grow to their natural mature height and a full canopy. Maintenance shall be limited to periodic pruning to maintain healthy trees, removal of diseased limbs, or removal of limbs or foliage that present a hazard. 
(7)  Landscape buffers shall be maintained and preserved along the entire length of the property. 
Landscape areas which are required to be created or preserved by this section shall not be used for the storage/display of materials or sale of products or services. 
(d)  Pruning . Pruning shall be permitted to allow for healthy growth, and to promote safety considerations. Trees which cause a conflict with views, signage or lighting shall not be pruned more than the maximum allowed. The town manager, development services director or building official may suspend the provisions of this section in case of a natural disaster. 
(1)  A maximum of one-fourth (1/4) of tree canopy may be removed from a tree within a one-year period, provided that the removal conforms to the standards of crown reduction, crown cleaning, crown thinning, crown raising, vista pruning, and crown restoration pruning techniques. All pruning shall comply with the American National Standards Institute, ANSI 300 (Tree, Shrub and other Woody Plant Maintenance), as amended.

(Ord. No. O-23-2012, § 1, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 10.5-48. - Findings. 
    As a result of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's determination that certain water bodies within Palm Beach County are impaired for excessive nutrient levels, the Town Council of the Town of Lantana finds that the best management practices contained in the most recent edition of the "Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries", are required in this division. 
(Ord. No. O-23-2012, § 1, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 10.5-49. - Purpose and intent. 
    This division regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; and specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer-free zones, and exemptions. This division requires the use of best management practices to minimize negative environmental effects associated with excessive nutrients in our water bodies. These environmental effects have been observed in and on Palm Beach County's natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, lakes, estuaries and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset important to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of Palm Beach County residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, is anticipated to help improve and maintain water and habitat quality. 
(Ord. No. O-23-2012, § 1, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 10.5-50. - Applicability. 
    This division shall be applicable to and shall regulate any and all applicators of fertilizer and areas of application of fertilizer to urban landscapes within the area of the Town of Lantana unless such application is specifically exempted by section 10.5-56 of this division. This division shall be prospective only, and shall not impair any existing contracts. 
(Ord. No. O-23-2012, § 1, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 10.5-51. - Timing of fertilizer applications. 
(a)  No applicator shall apply fertilizers containing nitrogen and/or phosphorus to turf and/or landscape plants during the prohibited application period or to saturated soils. 
(b)  Fertilizer containing nitrogen and/or phosphorus shall not be applied before seeding or sodding a site, and shall not be applied for the first thirty (30) days after seeding or sodding, except when hydro-seeding for temporary or permanent erosion control in an emergency situation (wildfire, etc.), or in accordance with the stormwater pollution prevent plan for that site. 
(Ord. No. O-23-2012, § 1, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 10.5-52. - Fertilizer free zones. 
    Fertilizer shall not be applied within ten (10) feet, or three (3) feet if a deflector shield or drop spreader is used, of any pond, stream, water body, lake, canal, or wetland as defined by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection at Chapter 62-340, Florida Administrative Code, or from the top of a seawall or lake bulkhead. Newly planted turf or landscape plants may be fertilized in this zone only for a sixty (60) day period beginning thirty (30) days after planting if needed to allow the vegetation to become well established. Caution shall be used to prevent direct deposition of fertilizer into the water. 
(Ord. No. O-23-2012, § 1, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 10.5-53. - Fertilizer content and application rates.

(b)  Nitrogen or phosphorus fertilizer shall not be applied to turf or landscape plants except as provided in section (a) above for turf, or in UF/IFAS recommendations for landscape plants, vegetable gardens, and fruit trees and shrubs, unless a soil or tissue deficiency has been verified by an approved test. 
(c)  Fertilizer used for sports turf at golf courses shall be applied in accordance with the recommendations in "Best Management Practices for the Enhancement of Environmental Quality on Florida Golf Courses", published by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, dated January 2007, as may be amended. Fertilizer used at park or athletic fields shall be applied in accordance with Rule 5E-1.003(2), Florida Administrative Code. 
(Ord. No. O-23-2012, § 1, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 10.5-54. - Fertilizer application practices. 
(a)  As required in section 10.5-52 of this division, spreader deflector shields shall be used when fertilizing via rotary (broadcast) spreaders. Deflectors must be positioned such that fertilizer granules are deflected away from all impervious surfaces, fertilizer-free zones and water bodies, including wetlands. Any fertilizer applied, spilled, or deposited, either intentionally or accidentally, on any impervious surface shall be immediately and completely removed to the greatest extent practicable. 
(b)  Fertilizer released on an impervious surface must be immediately contained and either legally applied to turf or any other legal site, or returned to the original or other appropriate container. 
(c)  In no case shall fertilizer be washed, swept, or blown off impervious surfaces into stormwater drains, ditches, conveyances, or water bodies. 
(d)  Property owners and managers are encouraged to use an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy as currently recommended by the University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service publications.

ARTICLE II. - NOISE 

Sec. 12-16. - Purpose. 
    The intent and purpose of this article is to eliminate, regulate and restrict sources and occurrences of noise and disturbances which interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of residential property and which are contrary to public welfare and constitute a nuisance to the public at large. 
(Ord. No. O-12-86, § 2, 5-12-86) 
Sec. 12-17. - Definitions. 
    Ambient noise means the all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from many sources at a given location. Certain zoning districts, therefore, will have varying ambient noise levels associated with the uses permitted in such districts. 
    Loud and raucous noise means any sound which because of its volume level, duration and character disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, health, peace or safety of reasonable persons of ordinary sensibilities within the limits of the town. This term includes the kinds of noise generated by the activities enumerated in section 12-19, whenever such loud noise is also "raucous", as characterized by noise's accompanying rough-sounding, harsh, boisterous and disorderly qualities. 
(Ord. No. O-10-03, § 1, 12-8-03) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-10-03, § 1, adopted Dec. 8, 2003, repealed § 12-17, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, § 12-17 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. O-12-86, § 2, adopted May 12, 1986; and Ord. No. O-05-94, § 1, adopted Dec. 12, 1994. 
Sec. 12-18. - Noise limitations; generally. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or create any loud and raucous noise which disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, health, peace or safety of reasonable persons of ordinary sensibilities anywhere within the town. The term "disturbs" shall be interpreted objectively to mean that there is an actual or imminent interference with peace or good order or that the noise would unreasonably disturb the peace and quiet of persons in the vicinity thereof. The phrase "loud and raucous" shall be interpreted objectively by considering the volume, intensity and duration of the noise; whether the noise is usual or unusual for the location; and the volume and intensity of the ambient noise at the location. Additionally, the fact that the property from which the noise originates is adjacent to a waterfront area shall be a factor for consideration as to whether a neighborhood is being unreasonably impacted by noise, (i.e. whether such sounds are audible across the water in residentially zoned neighborhoods situated across the water from commercially zoned waterfront businesses due to unbroken air spaces across the span of water and the unique characteristics of the transmission of sound across water surfaces). Alleged noise violations shall be reviewed in accordance with a "reasonable person" standard.

Editor's note- Ord. No. O-10-03, § 1, adopted Dec. 8, 2003, repealed § 12-18, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, § 12-18 pertained to noise limitations and derived from Ord. No. O-12-86, § 2, adopted May 12, 1986; and Ord. No. O-05-94, § 1, adopted Dec. 12, 1994. 
Sec. 12-19. - Prohibitions; categories of noise prohibitions: special regulations for mixed use zoning districts. 
    The following activities are prohibited when such are found to unreasonably disturb the peace and quiet of persons in the audible vicinity thereof. In addition, a rebuttable presumption exists that the ambient noise level of the town is reduced during the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays and on Sundays between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 12:00 midnight; and the ambient noise level at the time the noise is created shall be considered in an objective determination as to whether the noise levels are loud and raucous causing actual or imminent interference with the general peace and good order: 
(a)  Commercial, industrial, manufacturing, and construction noise. It shall be unlawful for any commercial, industrial, construction or manufacturing activities to be conducted within the town in such a manner that the noise resulting from such activity is determined to be unreasonably loud and raucous, and the reasonableness of such commercial, industrial, construction or manufacturing noise will be determined, in part, based upon the rebuttable presumption that the ambient noise level of the town is significantly reduced within the residential zoning districts R1A, R1, R3, and R15 during the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays and during the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays and on designated Town holidays, and for all other zoning districts during the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Furthermore, in determining whether unreasonably loud and raucous noise is associated with specific construction activities, the reasonableness of the noise will be determined, in part, based upon the presumption that such construction noise is normally associated with work done between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Finally, all such activities addressed in this subsection shall be conducted in a controlled manner so as not to create unreasonably loud, raucous, jarring, and disturbing noise or any like noise which is a nuisance to persons within the area of audibility. 
(b)  Noise from buildings, premises or property. No person owning or in possession or control of any building or premises shall use the same or rent the same to be used for any business or employment or residential use or for the purpose of pleasure or recreation, if such use shall, by its nature, be loud and raucous and thereby unreasonably disturb the peace of the neighborhood in which such building or premises is situated. 
(c)  Radios, electronic audio equipment and musical instruments. No person shall use, operate or play any radio, phonograph, stereo set, tape player, television set, sound amplifier or other electronic audio device or any musical instrument, whether amplified or not, which produces or reproduces sound in such a manner as to cause loud and raucous noise and thereby unreasonably disturbs the peace of the neighborhood in which such building or premises is situated. The reasonableness of the musical sound/noise will be determined, in part, based upon the rebuttable presumption that the ambient noise level of the town is reduced between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Unreasonable noise caused by operation of radios or other mechanical soundmaking devices within a motor vehicle shall be regulated by the provisions of state law as set forth at F.S. § 316.3045. 
(d)  Noisy and boisterous conduct. It shall be unlawful to knowingly and willfully cause or create loud and raucous noise by engaging in boisterous, jarring, noisy and loud conduct while upon a public street, sidewalk or parkway, so as to unreasonably disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of persons in any office, store, dwelling, hotel, motel or residence within the area of audibility. 
(e)  Nuisance by noise emitted by animals. It shall be unlawful for any person owning or having custody of any animal, domestic or otherwise, to permit such animal to create a nuisance by making loud and raucous noises which unreasonably disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. 
(f)  Noise determinations within the mixed use zoning districts. In making determinations as to whether violations regarding the above-referenced prohibitions (a) through (e) have occurred in the mixed use zoning districts, as defined at sections 23-101-23-104., the nature of this type of zoning district, representing a uniquely planned mix of uses to provide for residential, commercial and business uses situated in close proximity to each other, shall be considered as an additional factor in the determination as to the "reasonableness" of the noise created. Furthermore, the fact of the placement of the "MW waterfront mixed use district" adjacent to the waterfront shall also be a factor for consideration as to which neighborhoods are being unreasonably impacted by noises created within the MW district. (i.e. whether such sounds are audible across the water in other zoning districts situated across from the MW district due to the unbroken air spaces across the span of water and the unique characteristics of the transmission of sound across such water surfaces.)

(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders/predators are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders/predators commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender/predator victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this ordinance to serve and to protect the town's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the town by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

Sec. 13-23. - Prohibitions; penalties; exceptions.

(c)  Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding sixty (60) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment; for a second or subsequent conviction of a violation of this section, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment in the county jail not more than twelve (12) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

This police relief and pension fund shall consist of a defined benefit plan for the benefit of all town police officers. 
(b)  The fund shall be maintained in the following manner: 
(1)  By payment to the fund of the net proceeds of the 0.85 percent excise or other similar tax, which may be imposed by the town upon certain casualty insurance companies on their gross receipts of premiums from holders of policies, which policies cover property within corporate limits of the town as authorized by F.S. ch. 185, as amended. One hundred (100) percent of this tax money shall be allocated to this defined benefit plan each year upon receipt of the funds. Effective for the F.S. ch. 185 money received in calendar year 2016, the F.S. ch. 185 monies received annually shall be applied to reduce the town's annual required plan contributions, and all accumulated excess premium tax revenues on the effective date will be applied to reduce the town's annual required contribution to the plan for the 2015-2016 plan year.

Effective January 1, 2001, the contributions made by each participant shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the participant's gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of this division and other applicable laws, such contributions shall be considered participant contributions. 
(3)  By the payment of all fines and forfeitures imposed and collected from any police officer because of the violation of any rule and/or regulation promulgated by the board of trustees. 
(4)  By mandatory payment annually by the town of a sum, which together with the contributions from the police officers and the premium tax provided in Florida Statutes, § 185.08, and other income sources as authorized by law, will be sufficient to meet the normal cost and the amount required to fund over a period of forty (40) years or on a forty-year basis, any actuarial deficiency shown on a triennial actuarial valuation. 
(5)  By all gifts, bequests and devises when donated to the fund. 
(6)  By all accretions to the fund by way of interest or dividends on bank deposits, or otherwise. 
(7)  Under no circumstances may the town reduce the participant contributions to less than one-half percent of the compensation.

The payment of such services shall be determined by the board of trustees. No police officer shall be permitted to retire under the provisions of this section until he is examined by a medical board constituted in accordance with the provisions set forth in subsection a., above, of this section, and is found to be disabled in the degree and in the manner specified herein. Any police officer retiring under this section shall be examined periodically by a medical board to be selected by the board of trustees, as set forth in subsection a. above, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. 
d.  The benefit payable to a police officer who retires from service of the town with a total and permanent disability as a result of a disability commencing prior to his normal retirement date is two (2) percent of the sum of his or her average final compensation, payable until his death. The benefit for a police officer injured in the line of duty is the greater of the member's accrued benefit or forty-two (42) percent of average final compensation, with no minimum service requirement. The non-duty disability benefit is the greater of the police officer's accrued benefit or twenty-five (25) percent of average final compensation. 
e.  1.  This monthly retirement income to which a police officer is entitled in the event of his disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. 
2.  The last payment will be: 
i.  If the police officer recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
ii.  If the police officer dies without recovering from his disability or attains his normal retirement date while still disabled, the payment due next preceding his death. 
3.  Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled police officer shall be paid to the police officer's designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries), in accordance with the option the participant chose pursuant to section 14-83. 
f.  If the board of trustees finds that a police officer who is receiving a disability retirement income is, at any time prior to his normal retirement date, no longer disabled, as provided herein, the board of trustees shall direct that the disability retirement income be discontinued. Recovery from disability as used herein shall mean the ability of a police officer to render useful and efficient service as a police officer. 
g.  If the police officer recovers from disability and reenters the service of the town as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the town will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of this plan. 
(5)  Benefit limitations. 
a.  Basic limitations . Subject to the adjustments hereinafter set forth, the maximum amount of annual retirement income payable with respect to a participant under this plan shall not exceed the dollar amount as may be allowable for any calendar year pursuant to Section 415(b) of the Code, (one hundred seventy thousand dollars ($170,000.00) in 2005). 
For purposes of applying the above limitation, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits shall be adjusted, as provided by treasury regulations, so that such benefits are the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity. Notwithstanding any other plan provisions to the contrary, the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Section 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the Internal Revenue Code as set forth in this section of the plan and the applicable mortality table used for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code is the table prescribed in Rev. Rul. 2001-62. For purposes of this article, the following benefits shall not be taken into account: 
1.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
2.  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and treasury regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Section 415(b)(1) of the Code. 
b.  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limitation of this section with respect to any participant who at any time has been a participant in any other defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) maintained by the town shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all defined benefit plans in which the participant has been a participant were payable from one (1) plan. 
c.  Adjustments and limitations. In the event the participant's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the maximum amount of annual retirement income limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with the regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limitation (as reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income begins) which is equivalent to the Code Section 415(b) maximum amount of annual retirement income beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
1.  In the event the participant's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service, the adjustments provided for in subsection a. above shall not apply. 
2.  The reductions provided for in subsection a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
3.  In the event the participant's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limitation set forth in subsection (6) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). The adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury or his delegate. 
4.  Less than ten (10) years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any participant who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the department shall be the amount determined under subsection 1. of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the participant's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
5.  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a participant shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such participant under this plan and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the town contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the town has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contributions plan in which the participant participated. 
6.  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the participant's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which the participant participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the participant participated such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which the participant most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans, provided, however, that necessary reductions made in different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such participant. 
7.  Cost of living adjustments. The limitations as stated herein shall be adjusted to the time payment of a benefit begins in accordance with any cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to 415(d) of the Code. 
8.  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
i.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a participant of the plan on or after January 1, 1980, and who has not previously participated in such plan, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living adjustments. 
ii.  No participant of the Plan shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the participant is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits, military benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
9.  Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code shall be disregarded. The limitation on compensation for an eligible employee shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a participant of this plan before October 1996. 
(6)  Eligible rollover distributions . For any distribution made on or after January 1, 1993, notwithstanding any provision of the police pension fund and retirement plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. The terms "direct rollover," "distributee," "eligible retirement plan" and "eligible rollover distribution" have been included in the definitions section. 
(7)  Miscellaneous provisions. 
a.  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and participants and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
b.  Forfeitures arising from termination of service of participants shall serve only to reduce future town contributions. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. O-1-07, § 2, 2-26-07; Ord. No. O-01-2014, § 2, 1-27-14; Ord. No. O-02-2017, § 2, 3-27-17) 
Sec. 14-83. - Defined benefit plan-Options. 
(a)  Optional forms of retirement income. In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal, deferred or disability retirement, a participant, upon written request to the board of trustees, and subject to the approval of the board of trustees, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
(1)  Contingent annuitant option . A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the police officer during the joint lifetime of the police officer and a joint pensioner designated by the police officer, and following the death of the police officer, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six (66) percent, or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to the joint pensioner for life. 
(2)  Life annuity. The police officer may elect to receive an increased benefit payable for his life only. No benefit is ever paid to a beneficiary. 
(b)  The police officer upon electing any option of this section will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of the police officer's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time but any such change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to approval by the board of trustees. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a police officer has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and his or her retirement income benefits have commenced, he or she may thereafter change the designated joint pensioner or beneficiary but only if the board consents to such change and if the joint pensioner last previously designated by the police officer is alive when he or she files with the board of trustees a request for such change. The consent of a police officer's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. Each such designation will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board of trustees, and on completion will be filed with the board of trustees. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form or such other notice, the board of trustees shall adjust the police officer's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the police officer's current benefit and there is no impact to the plan. Any costs associated with these benefit calculations shall be borne by the police officer. No police officer's current benefit shall be increased as a result of a change of beneficiary. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the police officer, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the police officer subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid as provided in F.S. § 185.162. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a retired member may change his or her designation of joint annuitant or beneficiary up to two (2) times as provided in F.S. § 185.341 without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree is not required to provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. Any retired member who desires to change his or her joint annuitant or beneficiary shall file with the board of trustees a notarized notice of such change. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form or such other notice, the board of trustees shall adjust the member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current benefit and there is no impact to the plan. The beneficiary or joint annuitant being removed will be assumed deceased by the actuary in determining the actuarially equivalent amount of the revised monthly payment. No retirant's current benefit shall be increased as a result of the change of beneficiary. 
(c)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a police officer dies prior to his or her normal retirement date, no benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 14-84. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the police officer(s retirement under the plan, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the police officer upon his or her retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the police officer prior to his or her retirement and within ninety (90) days after the death of the beneficiary. 
(3)  If both the retired police officer and the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a)1.(b), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 14-84. 
(4)  If a police officer continues beyond his or her normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 14-82(2) and dies prior to actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section are in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the police officer in the amount or amounts computed as if the police officer had retired under the option on the date on which death occurred. 
(5)  No police officer may make any change in his or her retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his or her first retirement check. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. O-1-07, § 3, 2-26-07; Ord. No. O-04-2010, § 3, 4-12-10; Ord. No. O-02-2017, § 3, 3-27-17) 
Sec. 14-84. - Same-Change in status of participant. 
(a)  Termination of employment. 
(1)  Should any police officer leave the service of the town before accumulating aggregate time of ten (10) years toward retirement and before being eligible to retire under the provisions of this plan, such police officer shall be entitled to a refund of all of his or her contributions made to the municipal police officers' retirement trust fund, less any benefits paid to him or her. A participant who has ceased to be employed by the department as a police officer may elect to voluntarily leave his or her contributions in the participant's deposit account for a period of up to five (5) years pending the possibility of being rehired by the department. If the participant is not re-employed as a police officer with the same department within five (5) years, his or her contributions shall be returned to him or her, without interest, less any benefits paid to him or her. 
(2)  Should any police officer who has been in the service of the town for at least ten (10) years and has contributed to the fund for at least ten (10) years elect to leave his or her accrued contributions in the municipal police officers' retirement trust fund, such police officer upon attaining age fifty (50) years or more may retire at the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement income otherwise payable to him or her. 
(3)  Participants are one hundred (100) percent vested at ten (10) years of service. 
(b)  Death prior to retirement. Should any police officer die before being eligible to retire under the provisions of this plan, the beneficiaries of such deceased police officer shall be entitled to a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the contributions, made to the municipal police officers' retirement trust fund by such deceased police officer. If any police officer dies prior to retirement but has at least ten (10) years of contributing service, his or her beneficiary is entitled to the benefits otherwise payable to the police officer at early or normal retirement age. However, the benefits as provided in F.S. § 112.19, shall not be included as death or retirement benefits under the provisions of this plan. If the police officer dies and there is not a valid designated beneficiary or the designated beneficiary is not alive, then the benefit will be paid in accordance with section 14-78(b) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. O-01-2015, § 3, 3-9-15) 
Sec. 14-85. - Termination of fund. 
    Termination of the fund for any reason shall be accomplished in accordance with F.S. § 185.37, as amended. Upon the termination or partial termination of the plan, each affected participant's accrued benefit shall become one hundred (100) percent vested. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 14-86. - Rights and benefits not subject to legal process. 
    The rights and benefits provided herein are vested rights of participants in the fund, and shall not be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution or any other legal process. However, the following shall apply: 
(a)  The board shall honor court income deduction orders for the payment of alimony or child support in accordance with rules and procedures adopted by the board; or 
(b)  Upon written request by the retiree, the board of trustees may authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the monthly retirement payment funds necessary to: 
(1)  Pay for benefits being received through the town; 
(2)  Pay the certified bargaining agent; or 
(3)  To pay for premiums for accident health and long-term care insurance for the retiree, the retiree's spouse and dependants. A retirement plan does not incur liability for participation in this permissive program if its actions are taken in good faith pursuant to § 185.05(6), Florida Statutes. 
(4)  However, any and all additional costs associated with processing and/or making the requested payments will be paid by the retiree and not the fund. 
(Ord. No. O-04-2010, § 4, 4-12-10) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-04-2010, § 4, adopted Apr. 12, 2010, repealed § 14-86, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, § 14-86 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for derivation. 
Sec. 14-87. - Responsibility of town. 
    The town shall have no responsibility for the operation of the fund, except as specified herein, and shall bear no expense in the operation of the fund. However, the town shall be responsible to make contributions to the fund equal to the normal cost and the amount required to fund any actuarial deficiency shown by an actuarial valuation as provided in part VII of Ch. 112. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 14-88. - Previous participants. 
    The rights of all police officers previously employed by the town and eligible to receive benefits from those funds previously received by the fund shall be governed by, and calculated pursuant to, this division as in effect at the time of such police officers last date of employment. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 14-89. - Monthly supplemental benefits. 
    Any retiree or beneficiary who begins receiving pension benefits after October 1, 2000 is entitled to a monthly supplemental pension benefit equal to thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per year of service. The monthly supplemental benefit paid to police officers hired after March 27, 2017 will be limited to a maximum benefit of three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) per month. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. O-02-2017, § 4, 3-27-17) 
Sec. 14-90. - Deferred retirement option plan (DROP). 
(a)  Eligibility to participate in the DROP. 
(1)  Any participant who is eligible to receive a normal retirement pension may participate in the DROP. Participants shall elect to participate by applying to the board of trustees on a form provided for that purpose. 
(2)  Election to participate shall be forfeited if not exercised within the first thirty-two (32) years of combined credited service. 
(3)  A participant shall not participate in the DROP beyond the time of attaining thirty-five (35) years of service and the total years of participation in the DROP shall not exceed five (5) years. For example: 
a.  Participants with thirty (30) years of credited service at time of entry shall only participate for five (5) years. 
b.  Participants with thirty-one (31) years of credited service at time of entry shall only participate for four (4) years. 
c.  Participants with thirty-two (32) years of credited service at time of entry shall only participate for three (3) years. 
(4)  Upon a participant's election to participate in the DROP, he or she shall cease to be a participant and shall no longer accrue any benefits under the pension fund. For all fund purposes, the participant becomes a retirant. The amount of credited service and final average salary freeze as of the date of entry into the DROP. 
(5)  DROP participation shall end at the attainment of thirty-five (35) years of credited service or five (5) full years of DROP participation, which ever comes first. 
(b)  Amounts payable upon election to participate in DROP. 
(1)  Monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had the participant terminated employment with the Department and elected to receive monthly pension payments will be paid into the DROP and credited to the retirant. Payments into the DROP will be made monthly over the period the retirant participates in the DROP, up to a maximum of sixty (60) months. 
(2)  Payments to the DROP earn interest at the same percentage as interest is earned (or lost) by the fund as a whole, unless the board dedicates a separate investment portfolio for DROP payments, in which case the investment earnings (or losses) shall be measured by the investment earnings (or losses) of the separate investment portfolio. Costs, fees, and other expenses of administration shall be debited from the individual retirant accounts on a proportionate basis taking the cost, fees and expenses of administration of the fund as a whole, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in all individual retirant accounts and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund. The proportionate share of costs, fees and expenses of administration shall be debited to each retirant DROP account on a pro-rata basis. If a police officer does not terminate employment at the end of participation in the DROP, interest credits shall cease on the current balance and there shall be no future DROP deposits. 
a.  Interest shall be credited or debited to the member's average daily DROP balance on a quarterly basis at the net rate determined by the investment consultant quarterly and reported annually to the state. A participant's quarterly rate of return is calculated in a two (2) step process. Step 1 is to calculate each month's rate of return using the Modified Dietz formula. Step 2 is to link the monthly returns together. 
Step One (calculate the monthly returns using the modified Dietz Formula): 

Where: 
EMV is the ending market value. 
BMV is the beginning market value. 
F is the net external inflow for the period (contributions to a portfolio are entered as positive flows while withdrawals are entered as negative flows). The investment manager fee is not included in this calculation (net of fees). Other expenses including, but not limited to investment consultant, custodial, actuarial, administrative and legal fees are included. 

The sum of each flow F i multiplied by its weight W i . 
Where: 
Weight - W i is the proportion of the time period between the point in time when the flow F i occurs and the end of the period. 
W i can be calculated as: 

Where CD is the number of calendar days during the return period being calculated, which equals end date minus start date plus 1. D i is the number of days from the start of the return period until the day on which the flow F i occurred. This assumes that the flow happens at the end of the day. The investment manager fee is not included in this calculation (net of fees). Other expenses including, but not limited to investment consultant, custodial, actuarial, administrative and legal fees are included. 
Step Two (link the monthly returns) link the returns geometrically in the following fashion: 
[(1+R 1 ) x (1 + R 2 ) x (1 + R 3 )] - 1 = Quarterly rate of return 
Where: 
R1 = Return of month 1. 
R2 = Return of month 2. 
R3 = Return of month 3. 
b.  The rate is net of the investment manager fees are paid. The amount of the investment fees are reported monthly by the custodian and are reported annually by the auditor. Investment management fees are generally paid quarterly in arrears and are accounted for on a cash, not accrual basis. 
c.  Statements are effective December 31st, March 31st, June 30th, and September 30th. 
(3)  No payments will be made from DROP until the participant terminates employment with the department. 
(4)  Upon termination of employment, participants in the DROP will receive the balance of the DROP account in accordance with the following rules: 
a.  Participants may elect to begin to receive payment upon termination of employment or defer payment of DROP until the latest day under subsection c. below. 
b.  Payments shall be made in either: 
1.  Lump sum. The entire account balance will be paid to the retirant upon approval of the board of trustees. 
2.  Installments. The account balance will be paid out to the retirant in three (3) equal payments paid over three (3) years, the first payment to be made upon approval of the board of trustees. 
3.  Annuity. The account balance will be used to purchase an annuity to be paid monthly, the first payment to be made upon approval by the board of trustees. 
c.  Any form of payment selected by a police officer must comply with the minimum distribution requirements of the IRC 401(A)(9), and are subject to the minimum distribution requirements of the Code [e.g., payments must commence by age seventy and one-half (701/2)]. 
d.  The beneficiary of the DROP participant who dies before payments from DROP begin shall have the same right as the participant in accordance with section 14-87. 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. O-10-2015, § 1, 10-12-15) 
Sec. 14-91. - Cost of living adjustments. 
(a)  Subject to the conditions set forth in this section, the board of trustees shall annually authorize a cost of living adjustment, the amount of which shall be determined as of each September 30. The amount of the cost of living adjustment shall be equal to the actuarial present value of future pension payments to current eligible pensioners multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the rate of investment return and eight (8) percent. The actuary shall determine whether there may be a cost of living adjustment based on the following factors: 
(1)  The actuary for the pension fund shall determine the rate of investment return on the pension fund assets during the twelve-month period ending each September 30. The rate determined shall be the rate reported in the most recent actuarial report submitted pursuant to F.S. ch. 112, pt. VII. 
(2)  The actuary for the pension fund shall, as of September 30, determine the actuarial present value of future pension payments to current eligible pensioners (retired before October 1, 2017 and not a current employee on that date). The actuarial present values shall be calculated using an interest rate of eight (8) percent a year compounded annually, and a mortality table approved by the board of trustees and as used in the most recent actuarial report submitted pursuant to F.S. ch. 112, pt. VII. This will be the pool of funds available to fund the cost of living adjustment. 
(3)  If the actuary determines there may be a cost of living adjustment and provided that the present value of such benefits does not exceed the net actuarial experience accumulated from all sources of gains and losses, the board of trustees shall authorize such an adjustment unless the administrative expenses of distribution exceed the amount available for the distribution. 
(b)  Cost of living adjustments will be made to pensioners and beneficiaries. 
(c)  The cost of living adjustment will be made as a percentage of the benefit and the percentage will be the same for all recipients. The amount of the percentage increase will be determined by the fund's actuary in accordance with the above procedure. The percentage increase will be equal to the amount that can be fully funded by the pool of funds available and determined by that procedure. 
(d)  The cost of living adjustments shall be made as of July 1 and each July 1 thereafter, provided a person was retired for at least one (1) year on July 1. 
(e)  Members who retire (including entry into the DROP) on or after October 1, 2017 and DROP participants who are employed on October 1, 2017 shall receive an annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) equal to the preceding March's All Urban Consumer Price Index (CPI) in an amount not to exceed two and one-half (2.5) percent effective October 1 of each year. If the referenced CPI for March is negative, no adjustment shall be made. 
(f)  No police officer who is eligible for the COLA in section 14-91(e) will be eligible for the benefit provided in section 14-91(a)-(d). 
(Ord. No. O-18-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. O-02-2017, § 5, 3-27-17) 
Sec. 14-92. - Claims procedure.

Sec. 14-101. - Creation and maintenance of fund. 
(a)  There is hereby created a special pension fund for the firefighters of the town to be known as the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund. All assets of every description held in the name of the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund shall continue to be held along with such additions as are set forth herein and/or as may be added in the future shall be administered as set forth in this division of the Town of Lantana Code of Ordinances. There are three (3) distinct features of this plan: 
(1)  A defined benefit; 
(2)  A share account benefit; and 
(3)  A deferred retirement option plan (DROP). 
(b)  The financing of the fund shall come from the following sources of revenue which shall be allocated among the three (3) features of the plan as set forth hereinbelow: 
(1)  Taxes on insurance companies. The net proceeds of the one and eighty-five hundredths (1.85) percent excise tax which has been imposed by the town upon certain property insurance companies on their gross receipts of premiums from holders of policies, which policies cover property within the corporate limits of the town as authorized by Section 175.101, Florida Statutes, as amended. These amounts are to be deposited with the board of trustees within five (5) days of receipt. This tax money shall be allocated entirely to the defined benefit portion of the plan. 
(2)  Employee contributions. Ten (10) percent of the salary of each uniformed firefighter who is employed by the fire department of the town shall be deducted by the town from the compensation due to the firefighter and paid directly over to the board of trustees of the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund on a monthly basis. Of the total ten (10) percent contributed by each firefighter, two (2) percent shall be allocated to the defined benefit portion of the plan and the remaining eight (8) percent shall be allocated to the share account portion. The percentage deducted from the firefighters' salaries and deposited into the fund may be amended from time to time; however, under no circumstances may the town reduce the employee contribution to less than one-half (1/2) of one (1) percent of salary. Should an eligible member opt to participate in the DROP, the total ten (10) percent contributed by each firefighter shall be allocated to the share account portion. 
(3)  Fines and forfeitures. Any fines and forfeitures imposed and collected from any firefighters because of a violation of any rule and/or regulation promulgated by the board of trustees shall be allocated to the defined benefit portion of the plan. 
(4)  Town contributions. The town shall contribute to the defined benefit portion of the plan monthly an amount which together with the contributions from the firefighters and one hundred (100) percent of the amount derived from the premium tax provided for in Section 175.101, Florida Statutes, and other sources as authorized herein and by law will be sufficient to meet the normal cost of the defined benefit portion of the plan and to fund the actuarial deficiency over a period of not more than forty (40) years. An actuarial valuation of the retirement plan must be made at least once every three (3) years from the date of the last actuarial report. 
(5)  Gifts. All gifts, bequests and devises when donated to the fund shall be allocated to the defined benefit portion of the plan. 
(6)  Interests from deposits. All accretions to the fund by way of interest or dividends on bank deposits or otherwise will be allocated on a prorata basis equally among the defined benefit, share account and DROP portion of the plan. 
(7)  Other sources. All other sources of income now or hereafter authorized by law for the augmentation of the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund shall be allocated to the defined benefit portion of the plan. 
(Ord. No. O-6-92, § 1, 9-28-92; Ord. No. O-7-95, § 5, 9-25-95; Ord. No. O-11-97, § 1, 9-22-97; Ord. No. O-11-00, § 1, 8-14-00) 
Sec. 14-102. - Definitions. 
    The following words or phrases, as used in this division, shall have the following meanings: 
    Actuarial equivalence or actuarially equivalent shall mean that any benefit payable under the terms of this plan in a form other than the normal form of benefit shall have the same actuarial present value on the date payment commences as the normal form of benefit. For purposes of establishing the actuarial present value of any form of payment, all future payments shall be discounted for interest and mortality by using seven (7) percent interest and the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table for Males, with ages set ahead five (5) years in the case of disability retirees. In the case of a lump sum distribution, the actual present value shall be determined on the basis of the same mortality rates as just described and the pension benefit guaranty corporation's interest rates for terminating single employer plans, which rates are in effect (a) ninety (90) days prior to the member's date of termination if distribution is made within six (6) months of such date of termination, or (b) ninety (90) days prior to the distribution date if distribution is made later than six (6) months after the member's date of termination. 
    Aggregate number of years of service means the total number of years, and fractional parts of years, of service of any firefighters, omitting intervening years and fractional parts of years, when such firefighter may not be employed by the municipality. However, no firefighter will receive credit for years or fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his contributions to the defined benefit portion of the fund for those years or fractional parts of years unless the firefighter repays into the defined benefit portion of the fund the contributions withdrawn with interest, within ninety (90) days after his re-employment. 
    A firefighter may voluntarily leave his contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the fire department, pending the possibility of his being rehired by the same department and remaining employed for a period of not less than three (3) years, without losing credit for the time he has participated actively as a firefighter. If he does not remain employed for a period of at least three (3) years as a firefighter with the same department upon re-employment within five (5) years, his contributions to the defined benefit portion of the plan shall be returned to him without interest. 
    In determining the aggregate number of years of service of any firefighter, the time spent in the military service of the armed forces of the United States, or the United States Merchant Marine, while on official leave of absence in the event of a national emergency, shall be added to the years of actual service. However, credit for such military service shall not exceed five (5) years. Further, to receive credit for such service: 
(a)  The firefighter must return to his employment as a firefighter of the municipality within one (1) year from the date of his release from such active service; and 
(b)  The firefighter must contribute into the defined benefit portion of the fund the same sum which he would have contributed if he had remained a firefighter. Further, a request for credit for such military service must be made by the firefighter within ninety (90) days after reentering the service of the fire department from such leave of absence, or such military service credit shall be forfeited forever. 
    Annual rate of earnings or compensation means the total annual salary paid by the employer, before any payroll deductions for taxes or other purposes, to an employee for services rendered regardless of the intervals of payment. Annual rate of earnings or compensation will include: 
(1)  Overtime payments paid from a salary fund. 
(2)  Accumulated annual leave payments. 
(3)  Payments in addition to the employee's base rate of pay if all the following apply: 
a.  The payments are paid according to a formal written policy that applies to all eligible employees equally; 
b.  The policy provides that payments shall commence no later than the eleventh year of employment; 
c.  The payments are paid for as long as the employee continues his or her employment; and 
d.  The payments are paid at least annually. 
(4)  Amounts withheld for tax sheltered annuities or deferred compensation programs, or any other type of salary reduction plan authorized under the Internal Revenue Code. 
(5)  Payments made in lieu of a permanent increase in the base rate of pay, whether made annually or in twelve (12) or twenty-six (26) equal payments within a 12-month period, when the member's base pay is at the maximum of his or her pay range. 
When a portion of a member's annual increase raises his or her pay range and the excess is paid as a lump sum payment, such lump sum payment shall be compensation for retirement purposes. Annual rate of earnings or compensation, however, will not include fees paid professional persons for special or particular services or any bonuses or other payments prohibited from inclusion in the member's average final compensation and defined in Section 121.021(47), Florida Statutes. 
    Average final compensation, for a full-time firefighter, means the average of the five (5) highest fiscal years of compensation for creditable service prior to retirement, termination, or death or the date the firefighter begins participation in the DROP, whichever is earlier. For in-line-of-duty disability benefits, if less than five (5) years of creditable service have been completed, the term "average final compensation" means the average annual rate of earnings of the total number of years of creditable service. Each year used in the calculation of average final compensation shall commence on October 1. The average final compensation shall include accumulated annual leave payments not to exceed five hundred (500) hours and all payments defined as annual rate of earnings or compensation. The average final compensation shall not include compensation paid to professional persons for special or particular services; payments for accumulated sick leave made due to retirement or termination; payments for accumulated annual leave in excess of five hundred (500) hours; bonuses as defined in Section 121.021(47), Florida Statutes: third party payments made on or after July 1, 1990; or fringe benefits (for example, automobile allowances or housing allowances). 
    Beneficiary means any person who is entitled to receive a pension benefit payable from the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund upon the death of a member or participant. 
    Credited service means the number of years in months of a member's continuous service from date of employment until the date the member begins participation in the DROP or until the date of termination, whichever is earlier. Continuous service with the employer shall not be broken in the event of: 
(a)  Absence on an approved leave of absence; 
(b)  Absence from work because of occupational injury or disease incurred in employment for which a firefighter is entitled to workers' compensation payments; 
(c)  Absence due to service in the armed forces of the United States provided the firefighter shall re-enter employment with the town within one (1) year of discharge. 
    A firefighter shall not receive credited service in the case of any of the above absences or in the instance of receiving a disability retirement but shall retain all credited service previously accrued. Upon returning to work after any of the above absence periods, or upon re-entering service as a firefighter after recovering from a disability the firefighter will again accrue credited service in accordance with chapter 175, Florida Statutes. 
    Deferred retirement option plan (DROP): A portion of the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund which is optional for members who are eligible for normal retirement. Should an eligible member opt to participate in the DROP the town will cease all contributions to the fund on the member's behalf and the participant will also cease contributions to the defined benefit portion of the fund. Upon election to enter the DROP, participant's pension benefit will be calculated and pension payments payable to the member will be made directly to the DROP, not to the member. Administration of the DROP shall be as set forth hereinafter in this division of the Lantana Code of Ordinances.

    Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. (The term "Code" herein refers to the Internal Revenue Code; this definition applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.) 
    Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. (the term "Code" herein refers to the Internal Revenue Code; this definition applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.)

    Public safety service means the same as "firefighter service" as the term "firefighter" is defined herein but may also include service as a police officer with the town for the purposes of section 14-106(f)(5) only. 
    Retiree means a participant who retires from the defined benefit portion of the fund. 
    Retirement means a firefighter's withdrawal from the defined benefit portion of the plan payable from the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund directly to the member or to the DROP portion of the plan.

Each firefighter trustee may succeed himself as a trustee. Whenever the active firefighter membership falls below ten (10), an active firefighter member seat may be held by either a retired member or an active firefighter member of the plan who is elected by the active and retired members of the plan. If there are no active or retired firefighters remaining in the plan or capable of serving, the remaining board members may elect an individual to serve in the active firefighter seat. Upon receipt of such person's name, the town council shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the board of trustees.

(b)  Board vacancies; procedures to fill same. 
(1)  In the event a trustee provided for in Section 14-103(a)(2) ceases to be a firefighter in the employ of the Lantana fire department, he shall be considered to have resigned from the board of trustees. In the event such a trustee shall resign, be removed, or become ineligible to serve as trustee, the board shall, by resolution, declare that office of trustee vacated as of the date of adoption of such resolution. If such a vacancy occurs in the office of trustee within ninety (90) days of the next succeeding election for trustee, the vacancy shall be filled at the next regular election for the unexpired portion of the term; otherwise, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term at a special election called by the board. 
    In the event a trustee provided for in section 14-103(a)(1) and (3) shall resign, be removed or become ineligible to serve as trustee, the board shall, by resolution, declare that office of trustee vacated as of the date of adoption of the resolution.

Sec. 14-104. - Powers of the board of trustees. 
(a)  The board of trustees may: 
(1)  Invest and reinvest the assets of the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund in annuity and life insurance contracts of life insurance companies in amounts sufficient to provide, in whole or in part, the benefits to which all the participants in the fund shall be entitled under the provisions of this division and pay the initial and subsequent premiums thereon. 
a.  Only those firefighters who have been members of the firefighters' pension fund for one (1) year or longer may participate in the insured plan. 
b.  Individual policies shall be purchased only when a group insurance plan is not feasible. 
c.  Each application and policy shall designate the pension fund as the owner of the policy. 
d.  Policies shall be written on an annual-premium basis. 
e.  The type of policy shall be one which for the premium paid provides each individual with the maximum retirement benefit at his earliest normal retirement age. 
f.  An insurance plan may provide that the assignment of insurance contract to a separating firefighter shall be at least equivalent to the return of the firefighter's contributions used to purchase the contract. An assignment of contract discharges the fund and municipality from all further obligation to the participant under the plan even though the cash value of such contract may be less than the firefighter's contributions. 
g.  Provisions shall be made, either by issuance of separate policies or otherwise, that the separating firefighter does not receive cash values and other benefits under the policies assigned to him which exceed the present value of his vested interest under the retirement plan, inclusive of his contribution to the plan. The contributions by the state shall not be exhausted faster merely because the method of funding adopted was through insurance companies. 
h.

A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the attainment of twenty (20) years of credited service, any age; or age fifty-five (55) with at least ten (10) years of credited service. Members may retire on their normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter. 
(2)  Normal retirement benefit. The monthly amount of normal retirement benefit payable to a firefighter who retires on their normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to: 
a.  Retirement before October 1, 1992. One and one-half (1.5) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service.

c.  Retirement after October 1, 1997. Three (3) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service. 
d.  Retirement income shall be reduced for monies received under the disability provisions of this Chapter. 
(3)  Normal form of retirement benefit. 
a.  Unmarried member. The normal form of retirement benefit for an unmarried firefighter without dependent children or parents shall be a life annuity with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed. This form of annuity provides for a retirement benefit payable monthly to the retired employee during his lifetime with a guarantee that not less than one hundred twenty (120) monthly retirement payments shall be paid, even if the retired employee dies prior to the receipt of one hundred twenty (120) payments. (See section 14-105 and section 14-107.) The retirement income shall be reduced for moneys received under the disability provisions of this division. 
    The amount of monthly retirement income payable in the event of normal retirement will be payable on the 1st day of the month on the firefighter's normal retirement date or on the 1st day of the month coincident with or next following his actual retirement date, if later. 
b.  Married member. If the member is married, or has dependent children or parents, the normal retirement benefit shall be the fifty (50) percent "joint and survivor" annuity, as calculated in accordance with section 14-107(b)(1) unless the married member makes an affirmative written election of another option. 
(b)  Early retirement. 
(1)  Early Retirement Date. With the consent of the town, an employee who has attained age fifty (50) and completed at least ten (10) years of credited service may elect to terminate employment and retire on an early retirement date which may be the first day of any month after ten (10) years of service and attainment of age fifty (50). 
(2)  Early Retirement Benefit. The monthly amount of early retirement benefits payable to a firefighter who retires on the early retirement date shall be determined based on credited service to the early retirement date reduced in accordance with the following:

(c)  Disability retirement. 
(1)  Service incurred. A firefighter may retire from the service of the town under the plan, if prior to normal retirement date for the defined benefit portion of the plan, the firefighter becomes totally and permanently disabled in the line of duty as defined in subsection (3), by reason of any cause other than a cause set out in subsection (4), after the effective date of the plan. Such retirement shall herein be referred to as duty disability retirement. The provisions for disability retirement shall not apply to a member who has reached or passed normal retirement age of fifty-five (55) years or who is participating in the DROP portion of the plan. 
(2)  Nonservice disability. A firefighter must have five (5) years of credited service and must have contributed to the pension fund for five (5) years or more in order to receive nonservice disability benefits. The firefighter must be totally and permanently disabled as defined below. The provisions for nonservice disability shall not apply to a member who has reached or passed normal retirement age. 
(3)  Determination of disability. For purposes of this plan, a disability shall mean permanent and total disability as determined by the board of trustees, in accordance with the following standards: 
a.  A firefighter shall be deemed permanently and totally disabled, if in the opinion of the board of trustees he is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient service as a firefighter and is likely to remain so disabled continuously. 
b.  The board of trustees shall have the right to require the retiree or participant to submit to a physical examination at intervals determined by the board. The board's determination as to the existence and continuance of such disability shall be conclusive. 
(4)  Exclusions. A firefighter will not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the disability is the result of: 
a.  Excessive and habitual use by the firefighter of drugs, intoxicants or narcotics; 
b.  Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while committing a crime; 
c.  Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while serving in any armed forces; or 
d.  Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter after employment has been terminated. 
(5)  Medical review. No firefighter shall be permitted to retire under a disability retirement until examined by a duly qualified physician or surgeon to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose and found to be disabled in the degree and manner specified herein. 
(6)  Medical board. The board of trustees may designate a medical board to be composed of three (3) physicians (one selected by the member affected, one selected by the board and the third chosen by the aforementioned two (2) physicians), limited to medical doctors and/or doctors of osteopathy, who shall arrange for and pass upon all medical examinations required under the provisions of this division, shall investigate all essential statements or certifications made by or on behalf of a member in connection with an application for disability retirement and shall report in writing to the board of trustees its conclusions and recommendations upon all matters referred to it. The payment for such services shall be determined and paid by the board of trustees. 
(7)  Recovery. In the event of recovery from disability, as determined by the board, and in accordance with the recommendations and reports from the qualified physicians or surgeons who constitute the medical board and immediate reemployment by the town as an employee, a member's service will be deemed to have been continuous. However, the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the town's employ will not be considered as credited service for the purpose of this plan. Recovery from disability means the ability of the firefighter to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter. Upon recovery from disability at any time prior to normal retirement date, the board of trustees shall direct that the disability retirement income be discontinued. In the event of recovery, but without immediate re-employment as a firefighter, the member's future benefits shall be determined as though he initially terminated employment on his date of disability. 
(8)  Disability benefit. The disability benefit for non-service related disability shall consist of two (2) percent multiplied by the average final compensation multiplied by the years of credited service or a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of final average compensation and pension benefits. The disability benefit for a service related disability shall be seventy-five (75) percent of final average compensation, but in no event shall the disability benefit for a service related disability be less than the employee's accrued retirement benefit as provided in F.S. § 175.191(5). In no event should the single-sum value of such benefits as of the date of termination of service because of disability exceed one hundred (100) times the estimated normal monthly retirement income, based on the assumption that the present rate of compensation continues without change to normal retirement date. 
(9)  Payment procedures. The monthly retirement income to which a firefighter is entitled in the event of disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be, if the firefighter recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or if the firefighter dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled firefighter shall be paid to the firefighter's designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries). 
(d)  Death benefits. 
(1)  Vested active member. For any deceased actively employed member who was eligible for normal or delayed retirement as of his date of death, (i.e. had at least ten (10) years credited service) the benefit payable shall be that monthly amount which would have been payable had the deceased employee retired on the date of death, with the resulting benefit being payable to the beneficiary for ten (10) years. 
    If a firefighter dies prior to retirement, but has at least ten (10) years of contributing service the beneficiaries are entitled to the benefits otherwise payable to the firefighter at early or normal retirement age, whichever is applicable. The death benefit shall not be payable on behalf of any member who is participating in the DROP. 
(2)  Nonvested active member. If a firefighter dies before being eligible to retire under the provisions of this act, the heirs, legatees, beneficiaries, or personal representatives of such deceased firefighter shall be entitled to a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the contributions without interest made to the Lantana Firefighters' Pension Fund by such deceased firefighter. 
(e)  Separation from service. 
(1)  If a participant with ten (10) or more years of credited service who has contributed to the pension fund for at least ten (10) years terminates employment with the fire department either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under the fund, he may elect to leave his accrued contributions in the pension fund until he attains the age of fifty (50). Then, he may retire at the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement income otherwise payable to him. 
(2)  If participant terminates employment prior to the completion of ten (10) years credited service, such participant shall be paid within sixty (60) days of such termination, the total of his contribution made after July 1, 1963 less any disability benefits paid to him after July 1, 1963 without interest. 
(f)  A member may not receive a pension or disability benefit which exceeds the lesser of: 
(1)  Ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) (adjusted for cost of living in accordance with Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 415(d), but only for the year in which such adjustment is effective); or 
(2)  One hundred (100) percent of the average annual compensation for the member's three (3) highest paid consecutive years; however, benefits of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) a year can be paid without regard to the one hundred (100) percent limitation if the total retirement benefits payable to a member under all defined benefit plans (as defined in IRC, Section 414(j) maintained by the town for the present and any prior year do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and the town has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan (as defined in IRC, Section 414(i), in which the employee was a member. 
(3)  If the member has less than ten (10) years of service with the town, the applicable limitation in paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be reduced by multiplying such limitation by a fraction, not to exceed one (1). The numerator of such fraction shall be the number of years, or part thereof, of service with the town; the denominator shall be ten (10) years. 
(4)  For purposes of this subsection, "annual benefit" means a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity with no ancillary or incidental benefits and with no member or rollover contributions. To the extent that ancillary benefits are provided, the limits set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) above will be reduced actuarially, using an interest rate assumption equal to the greater of five (5) percent or the rate used for early retirement actuarial equivalence, to reflect such ancillary benefits. 
(5)  If distribution of retirement benefits begins before age sixty-two (62), the dollar limitation as described in paragraph (1) shall be reduced actuarially using an interest rate assumption equal to the greater of five (5) percent or the interest rate used for early retirement actuarial equivalence; however, retirement benefits shall not be reduced below seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) if payment of benefits begins at or after age fifty-five (55) and not below the actuarial equivalent of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) if payment of benefits begins before age fifty-five (55). For a member with fifteen (15) or more years of public safety service (see definitions) with the town, the reductions described above shall not reduce such member's benefit below fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) (adjusted for cost of living in accordance with IRS Section 425(d), but only for the year in which such adjustment is effective). If retirement benefits begin after age sixty-five (65), the dollar limitation of paragraph (1) shall be increased actuarially using an interest assumption equal to the lesser of five (5) percent or the rate used for early retirement actuarial equivalence. 
(6)  For the purposes of this subsection, the "average annual compensation for a member's three (3) highest paid consecutive years" shall mean the member's greatest aggregate compensation during the period of three (3) consecutive calendar years in which the individual was an active member of the plan. The sum of the defined benefit fraction and the defined contribution fraction for all qualified plans of the town for each common participant shall not exceed one (1). 
(7)  Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the IRC shall be disregarded. The limitation on compensation for a firefighter who was a member of this fund before October 1, 1996, shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account under this division as in effect on July 1, 1993. 
(g)  Eligible rollover distributions. For any distribution made on or after January 1, 1993, notwithstanding any provision of the Firefighters' Pension Fund to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. The terms "direct rollover," "distributee," "eligible retirement plan" and "eligible rollover distribution" have been included in the definitions section. 
(h)  Cost-of-living adjustment of benefits. For retirees or beneficiaries receiving an initial benefit on or after October 1, 2005, retirement income shall be increased by three (3) percent on October 1 of each year after the later of the date on which the retiree attains age 55 years or one (1) year after receipt of an initial benefit. As used in this section, "initial benefit" means the first monthly benefit payable to a retiree or beneficiary in accordance with the ordinance governing the determination of such benefit at the time of retirement or earlier death. In order to receive a cost-of-living adjustment of benefits, a participant must have been actively employed by Palm Beach County Fire-Rescue on or after October 1, 2005.

(f)  Death of participant. If a participant dies and is eligible for benefits from the individual participant account, the entire balance of the individual participant account shall be paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated in accordance with Section 14-105.(b).

(Ord. No. O-06-03, § 1, 10-27-03; Ord. No. O-06-04, § 1, 5-24-04) 
Sec. 16-2. - Purpose and scope of regulations. 
(a)  In general. The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communications in the town; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the town's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; to foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations and to promote the implementation of the town's comprehensive future land use plan. Additionally, this chapter provides for regulations to achieve the following: 
(1)  Property value protection. Signs should not create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, brightness or movement. They should be in harmony with buildings, the neighborhood and other conforming signs in the area. 
(2)  Communication. Signs should not deny other persons or groups the use of sight lines on public rights-of-way, should not obscure important public messages and should not overwhelm readers with too many messages. Signs can and should help individuals to identify and understand the jurisdiction and the character of its subareas. 
(3)  Preservation of community's beauty. Small towns such as this which include a public beach as well as small office, retail, residential and industrial uses rely heavily on their natural surroundings and beautification efforts to retain their economic viability. This concern is reflected by the active and objective regulations of the appearance and design of signs.

There shall be a publication of notice of the time, place and purpose of each hearing placed once in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing. 
(c)  The standards to be considered by the town council prior to granting a sign variance are as follows: 
(1)  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land on which the sign is proposed and that these conditions and/or circumstances are not applicable to other lands in the same zoning district or corridor. 
(2)  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
(3)  The granting of the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to others in the same zoning district or along the same corridor. 
(4)  Literal interpretations of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district or corridor under the terms of this chapter and would result in an unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(5)  The grant of the variance is not contrary to the intent of this chapter, will be in harmony with the purpose of this chapter and will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(d)  Violations; time limitations. Violations of such conditions and safeguards as prescribed by the town council when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and the variance shall be considered void. Variances shall become void if not exercised within six (6) months of the date granted. Before this six (6) month period has expired, the applicant may make a written request to the town council for an additional six (6) months extension. Any further extensions of time shall require a new application to be processed as a new case.

The town clerk shall provide written notice of such hearing to each of the property owners whose property is subject to being assessed. Such notice shall be provided by first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid, certified with return receipt requested, not less than two (2) days in advance of the hearing. In addition, notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given by two (2) publications approximately one (1) week apart in a newspaper of general circulation in Palm Beach County; the last publication shall appear not less than one (1) week prior to the hearing date; provided however that any mistake in such advertised notice or in any mailed notice shall not void any assessment levied in accordance with the provisions of this article. Said notice shall contain the date, time and place of the hearing, describe the area to be improved, and advise persons interested that the description of individual properties to be assessed and the amount of the assessment can be ascertained at the office of the town clerk. 
(b)  At such meeting, the town shall consider all objections relating to the assessments and shall make a final decision on whether to levy the special assessments. Thereafter, if the decision is to levy the special assessments, the town shall equalize or adjust such assessments where justice and right so dictate, and shall approve and confirm the assessment roll by resolution (the "assessment resolution"). When so equalized and approved, a final assessment roll shall be filed in the office of the town clerk, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid. 
(c)  A statement of the confirmed assessment shall be provided to each property owner listed on the roll. The property owner shall have such time as may be provided in the assessment resolution within which to pay the total assessment. 
(d)  The town shall determine in the assessment resolution when the payment of any special assessment levied pursuant to this article shall commence, and the frequency and amount of any scheduled collections of such assessments upon determination of the confirmed assessment roll, and the terms and conditions under which such assessments may be prepaid by the property owner.

Sec. 18-56. - Collection of payments; installment payments; certificate of indebtedness.

Promptly after adoption of the assessment resolution, a statement of the confirmed assessment shall be provided to each property owner listed on the confirmed roll. The special assessments shall bear interest and be payable at the time and in the manner stipulated in the assessment resolution, and shall remain liens, co-equal with the lien of all state, county, district, and municipal taxes, other non-ad valorem assessments which are duly levied and collected pursuant to the uniform method of levy, collection and enforcement of non-ad valorem assessments pursuant to Sections 197.3632 and 197.3635, Florida Statutes (the "uniform method"), superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims, until paid. The town may elect to either collect its own assessment or to utilize the uniform method. 
(b)  Installment payments. The assessment, subject to the interest provided in this section, may be satisfied through weekly, monthly or annual installments as provided for in the assessment resolution with such installment payment period to run not more than twenty (20) years from the completion date of the improvement or such other period as determined in the assessment resolution. 
(c)  Certificate issued for failure to pay assessment. In the event the town elects to collect its own assessments rather than utilize the uniform method whenever assessments are not paid within the time provided in the assessment resolution, a certificate of indebtedness shall be issued for each assessed lot or parcel. The certificate shall contain a description of the lot or parcel, the amount of the assessment, a description of the improvement, and shall identify the assessment resolution under which the assessment was made. Such certificate shall be recorded in the public records of Palm Beach County and shall constitute a lien coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and other municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid, and shall bear interest at a rate to be set forth in the assessment resolution. 
(d)  Enforcement of certificate. Upon failure of the property owner to pay any assessment installment due, any part thereof, or any interest, the procedures and remedies of the uniform method shall apply; or if the town has opted not to utilize the uniform method, then the town may cause the necessary proceedings to be brought to enforce payment of either the assessment or the certificate issued under section 18-56(c), together with all accrued interest and penalties thereon. As a part of such proceeding, the town shall be entitled to recover all costs and a reasonable attorney's fee. Default in the payment of any installment of the assessment or accrued interest shall result in the entire assessment plus interest and penalties thereon becoming immediately due and payable subject to foreclosure. Such foreclosure proceeding shall be instituted and prosecuted under Chapter 43 and Chapter 173, Florida Statutes. 
(e)  Validity. In no event shall the amount or validity of the lien or certificate of indebtedness as provided for by this article be questioned in any direct or collateral proceeding instituted more than thirty (30) days after the issuance of such certificate of indebtedness by the town, or such shorter time as may result from the filing of bond validation proceedings.

    The town is authorized to enter into interlocal agreements pursuant to Chapter 163, Florida Statutes, with other local agencies and governmental units in order to implement a special assessment program: (i) Where the improvement will be located within the municipal corporate limits of the town, but will benefit areas beyond the municipal corporate limits of the town, (ii) Where the improvement will be located outside the municipal corporate limits of the town, in an area which will not be serviced by the host governmental unit, (iii) Where other local agencies or governmental units are to provide funds to pay a portion of the total improvement costs, or (iv) Where another local agency or governmental unit is willing to waive an impact fee, concurrency fee or similar governmental charge and allow the town to levy a special assessment in lieu thereof to pay all or a portion of the total improvement costs of the proposed improvement to be constructed as part of the special assessment program. 
(Ord. No. O-6-95, § 1, 9-25-95) 
Sec. 18-61. - Specific provisions not a limitation. 
    Nothing in this article making specific provision and conditions for certain types of improvements to be made by special assessments shall be deemed or construed to limit or affect the power and authority of the town under Article VIII, Section 2(b) of the Florida Constitution, Chapter 166, Florida Statutes, and applicable law (i) to make the same or any other improvement apart from a special assessment, or (ii) to make any other type of improvement by special assessment. 
(Ord. No. O-6-95, § 1, 9-25-95) 
Sec. 18-62. - Irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any special assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the special assessment where the assessment roll has been confirmed by the town by adoption of the assessment resolution. The assessment roll as finally approved and confirmed shall be competent and sufficient evidence that the assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to the adoption of the assessment roll were duly had, taken and performed as required by this article, and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby.

Within twenty (20) days of the date that the motor vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to section 19-26 and whether or not a preliminary hearing is requested, the town shall mail notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the vehicle owner of record of the date, time, and location of a final hearing to be conducted pursuant to this subsection. The final hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless waived by the vehicle owner or continued by order of the special magistrate or alternate special magistrate, no later than forty-five (45) days after the date that the vehicle was seized and impounded. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the final hearing. The town shall have the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used as set forth in any of the sub-sections set forth in subsections 19-26(a)(1)-(6). If, after the hearing, a finding is made that the vehicle is subject to impoundment and seizure pursuant to section 19-26, and that none of the exceptions set forth in subsection 19-26(d) apply, then the special magistrate or alternate special magistrate of the Town of Lantana shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the town for hearing administrative penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), plus towing and storage costs as well as costs of the hearing. If, after the hearing, a finding is made that the town did not meet its burden of proof as set forth in this subsection or that one of the exceptions of subsection 19-26(d) apply, the vehicle shall be returned to the owner along with any bond posted. In such instance, no hearing costs shall be imposed. If the vehicle has been returned pursuant to section 19-27, and the owner has possession of the vehicle, the determination of the final hearing shall be whether the money or bonds remitted to the town shall be retained by the town or returned to the person remitting same. If the determination is made that the money or bonds shall be retained by the town, hearing costs shall also be assessed.

Editor's note- Ord. No. O-06-02, § 1, repealed art. I, §§ 21-1-21-3 in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, §§ 21-1-21-3 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1962, §§ 7-1, 7-2(a)-(e); and Ord. No. O-8-88, § 1, adopted May 9-1988. 

Sec. 21-1. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Average daily flow (ADF). The average daily flow used in determining average usage. All consumption data listed in the Uniform Water & Wastewater Service Policy which shall be adopted as a part of this ordinance shall be considered ADF, unless otherwise specified. 
    Base facilities charge. The charge to consumers for availability of service for any dwelling unit or commercial use, the amount of which shall be determined by resolution of the town council. 
    Capacity reservation. That capacity in the water/wastewater system reserved for the future for which the consumer is required to make reasonable payments based upon the fixed cost of the systems. 
    Contribution in aid of construction (CIAC). The sum of money and/or the value of the property represented by the costs of the water distribution and wastewater collection systems, including lift stations, constructed or to be constructed by a developer or the owner of a specified property, which such developer or owner transfers or agrees to transfer to the town at no cost to the town in order to induce the town to provide utilities service to specified properties. 
    Consumer installation. All facilities ordinarily on the consumer's side of the point of delivery. 
    Developer agreement. A written agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which water and wastewater service is provided. Such an agreement is required for all development except for single family homes up to and including fourplexes. 
    Dwelling unit (DU). A single unit or suite designed or intended for single family occupancy, including, but not limited to, one single family house, one side of a duplex, one apartment, one mobile home, one unit in a condominium, etc. 
    Equivalent residential unit (ERU). A factor used to convert a given average daily flow (ADF) to the equivalent number of residential connections. For this purpose, the ADF of one ERU is estimated to be three hundred fifty (350) gallons per day (GPD). The number of ERU's contained in a given ADF is determined by dividing that ADF by three hundred fifty (350) GPD. A residential, commercial, or industrial consumer may require a larger number of GPD than three hundred fifty (350) depending upon water demand characteristics. In any event, a single five-eights inch ( 5/8 ) meter or a single DU represents one ERU, as a minimum. When calculating the number of ERU's, all fractional numbers shall be rounded off to the next highest whole number. For clarification, the following equivalence table shall be utilized when dealing with the following customer classes and meter sizes: 
Customer Class Meter Size ERU's Assigned Single family 5/8 " or 3/4" 1.00 Single family Larger than 3/4": same as General service See below Multi-family 5/8 " or 3/4" .70 General service 5/8 " or 3/4" 1.00 General service 1" 2.50 General service 1 1/2" meter 5.00 General service 2" 8.00 General service 3" 16.00 General service 4" 25.00 General service 6" 50.00  
    Alternatively, where historical or engineering data is NOT available to calculate the appropriate number of ERU's needed for commercial establishments, the following equivalence table may be used: 
(1)  A washing machine is equivalent to one (1) fixture or one third ( 1/3 ) of an ERU. 
(2)  A dishwater is equivalent to one (1) fixture or one third ( 1/3 ) of an ERU. 
(3)  An inside or outside faucet or one (1) toilet is equivalent to one (1) fixture or one third ( 1/3 ) of an ERU. 
(4)  An automatic car wash: 
a.  If water re-circulated every three (3) drains is equivalent to one (1) ERU. 
b.  If water not re-circulated every one (1) drain is equivalent to one (1) ERU. 
    Fire line. A water line provided for the exclusive purpose of supplying fire sprinklers, standpipes, fire hydrants and/or fire hose stations or similar devices on privately-owned property structures. 
    Plant capacity charges. In addition to meter installation charges, all new water and wastewater system users are required to pay a fair share of the capital costs of expansion and improvement incurred through their new use. This capacity charge for new users shall be payable prior to the issuance of a building permit for structures and/or additions to existing structures where additional water and/or wastewater service is required. This charge shall also include the cost of purchasing new capacity from Lake Worth for wastewater disposal and is also known as an "impact fee." 
    Point of delivery. The point where the pipes or meters of the town are connected with the pipes of the consumer. Unless otherwise indicated, the point of delivery shall be the consumer's side or discharge side of the water meters that will be utilized for the delivery of water service, and the wastewater main or last manhole owned and operated by the town for wastewater service to the consumer. The town shall own all pipes and appurtenances to the point of delivery, unless otherwise agreed upon. The pipes and appurtenances outside the point of delivery shall belong to others. 
    Readiness to serve charge. The charge to recover costs related to maintaining currently unused capacity for the benefit of future customers of the town's water and wastewater systems. Such readiness-to-serve charge shall be calculated based on an equivalency basis (ERU) for carrying costs of related debt service along with operational maintenance and repair related costs, as well as capital costs, necessary to maintain the unused capacity of the system for the benefit of future customers. 
    Water only service. For those residences and business establishments utilizing potable water which is not returned as sewage, the following will apply: 
(1)  Residential: Potable water for irrigational purposes is not encouraged. However, for such use or for consumption with septic tanks or private sewage disposal systems, the consumer may have installed a second residential water meter [five-eights inch ( 5/8 ")] for irrigational purposes for which no wastewater use shall be charged. 
(2)  Commercial: Businesses such as industrial processes, garden nurseries, car washes, etc., which do not return the water to the town wastewater system shall have two (2) separate water meters; one (1) to serve the normal domestic usage (water and wastewater as applicable), and a separate water meter for water only uses, and shall be billed accordingly.

See section 21-5. for charges related to repair of water meters if same have been altered or tampered with by the customer. The town is responsible for all repairs to the actual wastewater main and/or water main itself regardless of where it is located and for all repairs to all laterals up to the property line and/or easement boundary; however, the customers are responsible for all repairs laterals on their own property or remainder of property beyond the easement boundary. Customers are responsible for presenting proof to the town that repairs are necessary with the areas assumed as the responsibility of the town. Any repair and/or new construction to be accomplished on the customer's property or on town-owned property, rights-of-way, easements, etc., must be permitted by the town building department. 
(Ord. No. O-06-02, § 1, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 21-5. - Water meters and curb stops; reading; tampering. 
(a)  All premises using the town's water supply must be equipped with an adequate water meter. All water meters shall be read by an employee of the town on a monthly basis. The customer shall be responsible to pay for all water consumption as indicated by his meter.

(Ord. No. O-06-02, § 1, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 21-8. - Refundable advances. 
    The town may require, in addition to the rates, fees and charges duly adopted by resolution of the town council, a refundable advance in cash or in property by developers or consumers to defray the cost of any off-site extension of water and/or wastewater mains and appurtenant facilities necessary to connect the developer's or consumer's property with the then terminus of the town's water and/or wastewater facilities. Such developers or consumers shall always be responsible for and shall not be refunded their hydraulic share of the cost of such off-site water and wastewater facilities. 
    However, in instances in which a developer or consumer may be required to advance the construction funds applicable for other undeveloped property in order that off-site facilities may be constructed to serve the developer's or consumer's property, amounts expended by such developer or consumer, over and above their hydraulic share and other applicable rates, fees and charges, are subject to refund to such developer or consumer, in accordance with the terms and conditions of a refunding agreement executed between such developer or consumer and the Town of Lantana in the format as described in section 21-2(e). The refund agreement shall be subject to negotiation between the town and such developer or consumer. In no event shall such developer or consumer recover an amount greater than the costs of such improvement contemplated herein, and the town shall not include any interest upon the refund of such developer's or consumer's advance. 
    The town will make refunds to such developers or consumers entitled to refundable advances on a pro-rata basis as others tie into the utility system and pay off-site charges to the town. In no event shall the town be required to refund more funds to a developer or consumer than the town has collected from others. Refunds made by the town to such developers or consumers shall be made as set forth within the refunding agreement. Furthermore, and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the town shall limit the life, within the terms of such refunding agreement, to a term of five (5) years, after which time any portion of the refund made to such developer or consumer by the terms and conditions of the refund agreement will become the property of the town, and such refund agreement shall be void.

Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the town for review, and shall be acceptable to the town before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the town under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the town prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
    The town shall annually publish in the largest local daily newspaper a list of the users which were not in compliance with any Pretreatment Requirements or Standards at least once during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same twelve (12) months. 
    All records relating to compliance with Pretreatment Standards will be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. 
(g)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
    When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets, or secret processes, shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
    Information accepted by the town as confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the town until and unless a ten (10) day notification is given to the user.

All development within the Town and all development orders, permits and public action related to such development shall be consistent with the Town's comprehensive development plan, as required by F.S. ch. 163.3194, as amended and/or renumbered from time to time. The effect of the comprehensive plan shall be to ensure that adequate potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, stormwater management, park, road, public school facilities, mass transit public facilities, and fire-rescue public facilities are available to accommodate development concurrent with the impact of development on such public facilities, consistent with the LOS standards for those public facilities adopted in the Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  LOS for public schools; exempted development orders. The following definitions of "Level of Service (LOS)" standards and "exempted development orders" shall apply to the review of public school facilities. 
LOS for public schools means the following for public school facilities: To ensure the capacity of schools is sufficient to support student growth at the adopted level of services for each year of the five-year planning period and through the long-term planning period for each concurrency service area ("CSA"), the school concurrency agreement established LOS as set forth below. The actual LOS for each type of school in each CSA shall be established each year in each CSA by the first student count of the second semester. 
(1)  Tiered levels of service shall be in force pursuant to the Tiered Level of Service Table in the Public School Facilities Element until August 1, 2004. Individual schools of each type may exceed the tiered LOS during the period in which tiered LOS are in effect, provided that the CSA's tiered LOS is not exceeded. However, each individual school's LOS which exceeds the tiered LOS, during the time that the tiered LOS is in effect, shall not exceed the utilization standards for that school type as shown in the maximum utilization table of the public school facilities element. During the time that the tiered level of service standard is in effect, the School District shall initiate necessary program and/or boundary adjustments so that the tiered LOS is not exceeded in each CSA. 
(2)  After August 1, 2004, the following LOS standards shall be established for all schools of each type within each CSA and each individual school: a.) 110% of capacity (utilization) as determined by the Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH); or b.) a higher LOS up to 120% of FISH capacity (utilization/LOS) for individual schools subject to the results of a School Capacity Study (SCS) undertaken by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in consultation with all local governments with jurisdiction within the CSA and the School District to determine if a particular school can operate in excess of 110% capacity. The SCS shall be required if a school in the first student count of the second semester reaches 108% or above of FISH capacity, once the level of service above is achieved. If the SCS concludes that the school can operate with the FISH guidelines and not exceed 120% LOS, then that school shall be considered to be operating within the adopted LOS and the CSA LOS shall be amended. 
(3)  School concurrency shall be measured and applied on the basis of twenty-one (21) CSAs as described in the Public School Facilities Element. In determining whether capacity is available, the School District shall consider any new capacity which will be in place or under actual construction in the first three (3) years of the School District Five-Year Capital Facilities Plan. In determining whether capacity is available, the School District shall consider adjacent CSA capacity as specified in the School Concurrency Agreement. 
(4)  These standards shall not apply to proposed new residential development until the commencement of the School Concurrency Program as specified in Article V, Section A of the Agreement. 
(c)  Exempted Development Orders . The following applications for development orders are exempted from the LOS for public school facilities: 
(1)  In the event termination or suspension of the School Concurrency Program occurs as set forth in the School Concurrency Agreement. 
(2)  Single-family lots of record, existing as such at the time this Ordinance is adopted. 
(3)  Any residential development that received final approval of a site-specific development order prior to the commencement of the School Concurrency Program, as specified in Article V, Section A of the School Concurrency Agreement, or is exempt from concurrency under a local government's concurrency regulations is considered vested for that which was previously approved and shall not be considered as proposed new residential development for purposes of school concurrency. Any residential development which is exempt from school concurrency under the Town's concurrency regulations shall not be considered as new residential development for purposes of school concurrency. 
(4)  Any new residential development that has filed a complete application for a site specific development order, or any amendment to any previously approved development order pending prior to the commencement of the School Concurrency Program, as specified in Article V, Section A of the School Concurrency Agreement. 
(5)  Any residential development which is restricted to elderly and meets the requirements under the Federal Fair Housing Act to be designated as an adults-only community. 
(6)  Any amendment to any previously approved residential development which does not increase the density of the development. 
(7)  Any previously approved residential development or any other previously approved development with a residential component located within any existing "Transportation Concurrency Exception Area," as defined in F.S. § 163.3180(5).

If the development is not in compliance, the Letter of Determination of Concurrency shall detail why the development is not in compliance and shall offer the applicant the opportunity to enter into a ninety (90) day negotiation period. During the ninety (90) day negotiation period, the applicant shall meet with the School District in an effort to mitigate the impact from the development. Mitigation shall be limited to those options which the School District recognizes and assumes the responsibility to operate and which will maintain the adopted LOS standards for the first five (5) years from receipt of the School District's Letter of Determination of Concurrency; however, the Town shall have the opportunity to review the mitigation options. If the School District and the developer agree to mitigation, the Letter of Determination of Concurrency shall be issued, conditional approval upon the agreed mitigation measures, and an agreement between the School District and the Developer. If mitigation is not agreed to, the Letter of Determination of Concurrency shall be detailed why litigation proposals were rejected and detail why the proposed new residential development is not in compliance. In this case, no development order shall be issued. 
f.  Letter of Determination of School Concurrency finding the development in compliance shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of issuance unless extended by the School District. Once the Town's site-specific development order is issued, the concurrency determination shall run with the development order. 
(3)  Development Order Approval. 
a.  No development order for a proposed new residential development shall be approved unless there is a valid Letter of Determination of Concurrency from the School District finding the development in compliance. 
b.  If the Letter of Determination of Concurrency requires conditions or mitigation to be placed on the Development, the development order issued by the Town shall incorporate those conditions. 
c.  If the Letter of Determination of Concurrency requires the development to be phased to mitigation, the conditions of approval of the development order shall implement the phasing requirements by specifying that building permits application will not be accepted if the conditions are not fulfilled. 
d.  In no case shall a development order be issued unless provisions are made through conditions of approval or by agreement between the developer and School District to provide Performance Security when required. 
(4)  Appeals . Applicants seeking relief from School District decisions shall appeal such decisions as provided for by law. 
(c)  Proportionate fair-share program. 
(1)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the Proportionate Fair-Share Program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
(2)  Applicability. The Proportionate Fair-Share Program shall apply to all developments that fail to meet the standards of this Chapter and the Town's Comprehensive Plan on a roadway within the Town that is not the responsibility of Palm Beach County, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) or another agency. The Proportionate Fair-Share Program does not apply to the following: 
a.  Collector and arterial roads which are not the responsibility of the Town pursuant to Section 1.3(4) of the Charter of Palm Beach County, Florida. However, a traffic concurrency letter from the county is required to be submitted by the applicant certifying compliance with the county-wide Traffic Performance Standards Ordinance adopted pursuant to the County Charter prior to the issuance of a development order by the Town. 
b.  Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12). 
c.  Projects exempted from this chapter by state law. 
d.  Projects that received traffic concurrency approval prior to December 1, 2006. 
e.  Individual single-family homes. 
f.  Vested projects. 
(3)  General Requirements. An applicant may choose to satisfy the LOS for transportation by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, so long as each of the following requirements are met: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
b.  The road improvement necessary to maintain the LOS for transportation is identified in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE. 
c.  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation shall meet the Town's design standards for locally maintained roadways. 
(4)  Intergovernmental coordination. Pursuant to policies in the Intergovernmental Coordination Element of the Comprehensive Plan, the Town shall coordinate with Palm Beach County and other affected jurisdictions such as FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(5)  Application process. 
a.  In the event of a lack of capacity, to maintain the LOS for transportation, the applicant shall have the opportunity to satisfy LOS for transportation requirements through the Proportionate Fair-Share Program subject to the requirements of subsection (c). 
b.  Prior to the submittal of an application, eligible applicants shall schedule a pre-application meeting with Town staff. Subsequent to the pre-application meeting, eligible applicants shall submit a completed development application and all documentation requested by the Town. The applicant shall be required to pay a reasonable fee for the cost of reviewing the application, said fee to be set by Resolution of the Town Council. If the impacted facility is on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), then FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. The Town shall also have the option of notifying and inviting Palm Beach County. 
c.  Town staff shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete within 14 working days. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the Proportionate Fair-Share Program as indicated in subsection (c), then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed withdrawn and all fees forfeited to the Town, unless the Town determines that the applicant is working toward a remedy of the stated deficiencies in good faith, in which case the Town may extend the deadline as deemed appropriate by the Town. 
d.  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
e.  When an application is deemed sufficient and complete in accordance with subparagraph 3, above, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement prepared by the Town shall be executed by the applicant and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility, no later than 60 days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient and complete application. If the agreement is not received by the Town within these 60 days, then the application will be deemed withdrawn and all fees forfeited to the Town, unless the Town determines that the applicant is working toward a remedy of the stated deficiencies in good faith, in which case the Town may extend the deadline as deemed appropriate by the Town. 
f.  No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the Town through an administrative approval. 
(6)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
a.  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for transportation LOS impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
b.  A development eligible for participation under the Proportionate Fair-Share Program shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
c.  The methodology used to calculate a development's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS. 
Mathematically stated as: 
Proportionate Fair-Share = S [[(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] x Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those peak hour trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the Town's concurrency management system; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Peak hour service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per subsection (c); 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering review, inspection, administration, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost, including contingencies, in the year it will be incurred. 
d.  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the Town Engineer shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual and/or anticipated cost of the improvement in the year that construction will occur. 
e.  If an improvement is proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineer's certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the Town engineer or by some other method approved by the Town engineer. 
(7)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
a.  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against road impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by road impact fees which may hereafter be established by the Town. 
b.  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed project. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed project cannot be transferred to any other project. 
(8)  Proportionate fair-share agreements 
a.  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement ("Agreement"), the applicant shall receive a certification of concurrency reservation for capital road facilities. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within twelve (12) months, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply, unless the Town and the applicant mutually agree to an extension. 
b.  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full no later than issuance of the first building permit, and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than ninety (90) days from the date of execution of the Agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment, pursuant to subsection f. and adjusted accordingly. 
c.  In the event an agreement requires the applicant to pay or build one hundred (100) percent of one or more road improvements, all such improvements shall be commenced prior to issuance of a building permit and assured by a binding agreement that is accompanied by a Performance Security, as determined by the Town, which is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. 
d.  Dedication of necessary rights-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement shall be completed prior to issuance of the first building permit. 
e.  Any requested change to a development subsequent to the issuance of a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require additional mitigation. 
f.  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs paid to the Town will be non-refundable. 
(9)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues 
a.  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. Proportionate fair-share revenues may be used as the fifty (50) percent local match for funding under the FDOT TRIP, or any other matching requirement for State and Federal grant programs as may be allowed by law. 
b.  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the Town that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c).

Sec. 23-48. - Minor modification of site plan approved previously by plan review committee. 
    The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for the minor modification of a site plan previously approved by the Plan Review Committee. Minor modifications are those types of amendments, corrections or changes that are not significant enough to warrant full site plan review and are listed in section 23-48(b). The Town will consider a request for minor site plan modifications upon receipt of a letter explaining the details, impacts and need for the modifications and payment of the fee established by the adopted fee schedule. The Plan Review Committee shall consider the requested minor modifications and may approve, disapprove or approve with changes. 
(a)  Applicability . The procedure established in this section may only be utilized to modify a site plan previously approved by the Plan Review Committee (PRC). Such a request may only be considered and granted one time per site plan without further review by the PRC. A request to modify a site plan previously approved by the Town Council as part of special exception approval will require a full special exception review as established in section 23-75. 
(b)  Minor site plan modifications are those which: 
(1)  Decrease the density, intensity and/or total floor area of any building, or reduce the number of principal structures, height, stories, or units; 
(2)  Cosmetically alter the external facade of an existing or proposed building, including new or renovated signage, awnings and architectural detailing, provided that the overall architectural character is not changed; 
(3)  Increase yards, setbacks or both, provided that the zoning district does not have a "build to" requirement. If the removal of any portion of a structure results in an increase in yard or setback, the original architectural and site character must be maintained and the department may impose conditions of approval to ensure this requirement is met; 
(4)  Relocate no more than ten (10) percent of the total building footprint on a site; 
(5)  Involve the demolition and replacement of a structure that was built according to a previously approved site plan and the new structure is the same total floor area or less than the original structure and meets the requirements of this subsection. If the demolished structure is not to be replaced, then this procedure is not required and only a demolition permit shall be required. 
(c)  Minor site plan modifications shall not: 
(1)  Increase negative impacts on adjacent properties; 
(2)  Increase traffic generated on the site; 
(3)  Increase parking demand or reduce the number of parking spaces on the site; 
(4)  Increase intensity or density on the site. 
Sec. 23-49. - Expedited permitting program. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The expedited permitting program provides qualifying projects an efficient and accelerated permitting process to resolve development issues in a timely manner without sacrificing any requirements established in this chapter. The expedited permitting program is available to qualifying companies that are expanding operations, relocating or establishing their business for the first time within the Town so that value-added employment may be created at a faster pace. 
(b)  Applicability. The Town shall utilize the following qualification criteria when determining whether a company qualifies for the expedited permitting program: 
(1)  The company must initially fall into one (1) of the following industry clusters: 
a.  Medical and pharmaceutical; 
b.  Aerospace and engineering; 
c.  Information technology; 
d.  Business and financial services; 
e.  Education activities related to any qualifying industry clusters; 
f.  Research and development activities related to any qualifying industry clusters; or 
g.  Any other industry cluster or company headquarters receiving approval by the Town Council. 
h.  Developments including buildings obtaining a Leadership in Environmental Engineering and Design ("LEED") certification shall qualify for expedited permitting. At the time of application for the expedited permitting program that applicant shall provide a letter from the U.S. Green Building Coalition ("USBC") stating that the applicant has submitted the design phase application and listing the anticipated credit achievement for the project. Such developments which qualify for LEED certification by USBC are eligible for expedited permitting regardless of whether or not they also satisfy the requirements of sub-sections (2) or (3) below. 
(2)  The following additional requirements or definitions are also applicable to initially qualifying industry clusters seeking acceptance into the expedited permitting program: 
a.  The company must also demonstrate the capability to create at least ten (10) new, value-added positions in the Town of Lantana within the first two (2) years of operation; or expand its operation within the Town as a result of creating at least ten (10) new positions in the two (2) years prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the new or expanded facilities; or a combination thereof. 
b.  Positions created will be considered value-added employment based on the average wages and/or compensation paid by the employer. Value-added employment is defined as whenever the average compensation package of positions created is at least ten (10) percent higher than the average current per capita income level in Palm Beach County or ten (10) percent higher than the industry average as reported by the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, University of Florida. 
c.  Companies must submit sufficient financial information to establish solvency and credibility prior to acceptance into the program. Due diligence reports to establish such financial credibility or solvency may include a Dun & Bradstreet report or other such reports as deemed necessary by the Town; and such reports must be reviewed by the Town Manager, development services director, and/or finance director for the Town. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the criteria above, a company may still qualify for the expedited permitting program if the company is a sanctioned project by the State of Florida or other officially sanctioned economic development organization (e.g. Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade & Economic Development ("OTTED"), Enterprise Florida, or the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County). 
(c)  Benefits. Companies that have been accepted into the expedited permitting program shall receive the following benefits: 
(1)  The Town Manager or development services director shall appoint a single point of contact at the Town who shall be kept apprised of all developments relating to the review of the project by the Town's Plan Review Committee ("PRC") in order to keep the project on track and provide a periodic status report to the company's project manager; and 
(2)  The development services department shall establish the necessary steps required for project approval in a pre-application meeting, and subsequently, prepare an itemized timetable for the project's completion of the development review process; and 
(3)  The project shall receive priority at every phase of the review process by Town staff, including face-to-face meetings; and 
(4)  The Town's PRC shall review and provide comments relative to the project within a timeframe not to exceed seven (7) business days after submission of plans by the applicant deemed sufficient by the development services director; and 
(5)  In the case that major issues arise at any point during the development review process, a face-to-face meeting of all concerned parties will be called within three (3) business days so that a resolution may be accomplished in a timely and efficient manner.

(Ord. No. O-08-2010, § 1(Exh. A), 7-12-10) 
Sec. 23-63. - Same-Powers and duties. 
    The zoning board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
(a)  Administrative review. To hear and make recommendations to the Town Council when it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by administrative officials in the enforcement of this chapter. 
(1)  Public hearing, zoning board of appeals. Administrative appeals shall be taken within thirty (30) days of the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, by filing with the zoning board of appeals a written application specifying the grounds of the appeal. The appeal shall be in such form as prescribed by the rules of the zoning board of appeals. After such filing of the appeal, the Town clerk shall forthwith transmit to the board all materials constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Such materials shall also be transmitted to the plan review committee for recommendation to the zoning board of appeals. The board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing and give due public notice thereof. 
(2)  Notice requirements. Due public notice as herein required shall be deemed sufficient when a notice is published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the Town, approximately ten (10) days before the public hearing date. A copy of such notice shall be mailed by certified mail to the parties in interest and to all property owners as shown on the records of the county property appraiser within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved in the application. If the property involved in the application is a condominium, then the required notice shall be by certified mail to the condominium association and by regular mail to the individual owners. The notice shall state the substance of the administrative appeal and shall state the time and place for the public hearing before the zoning board of appeals and may include the hearing date for the Town Council, if known, since the zoning board of appeals must submit its recommendation to the Town Council for final hearing on the matter. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney at the public hearing. 
(3)  Public hearing, Town Council. The zoning board of appeals shall transmit its written recommendation to the Town Council within ten (10) days of the hearing with a copy to the applicant, which shall include the date of the final hearing before the Town Council.

The Town Council shall consider the recommendations of the zoning board of appeals but shall not be bound thereby. The date for the public hearing before the Town Council shall, whenever feasible, be set at the same time the hearing date is set for the zoning board of appeals, and may be included in the advertisement for the zoning board of appeals hearing, if known. One (1) additional advertisement of the public hearing before the Town Council shall be placed in a local newspaper approximately ten (10) days prior to the final public hearing. The Town Council shall make a final determination of approval, approval with conditions attached, or denial at the final public hearing and a written order shall be issued within ten (10) days of the hearing date. 
(b)  Variances. The zoning board of appeals shall have the duty and authority to hear applications for variances as set forth herein and make recommendations to the Town Council within the guidelines in this chapter. When an application for variance is submitted to the Town, such application shall be submitted to the plan review committee for recommendation to the zoning board of appeals. Upon determination by the Town that the application is complete, a public hearing shall be set in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. 
(1)  Public hearing, zoning board of appeals. A public hearing shall be held by the zoning board of appeals on all applications for variances. In considering recommendations of approval or denial of the application, the zoning board of appeals must consider that variances may only be permitted where there are unusual and practical difficulties in carrying out the provisions of this chapter due to an irregular shape of the lot, topographical irregularities, or other specific site conditions. The zoning board of appeals shall consider, whether, owing to these special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. In order to authorize any variance from the terms of this chapter, the zoning board of appeals must find that: 
a.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land structure or building involved and that these conditions and/or circumstances are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district. 
b.  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
c.  The granting of the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
d.  Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this chapter and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
e.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
f.  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter and that such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. In recommending variances to the Town Council, the zoning board of appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity of this chapter. 
(2)  Notice of requirements. Notice requirements for public hearings on variance applications before the zoning board of appeals shall be the same as those for administrative review, as specifically set forth in section 23-63(a)(2) above. 
(3)  Public hearing, Town Council. The zoning board of appeals shall transmit its written recommendation to the Town Council within ten (10) days of the hearing with a copy to the applicant, which shall include the date of the final hearing before the Town Council. The Town Council shall hold a final public hearing on all applications for variances submitted from the zoning board of appeals after a hearing has been held by that board. The Town Council shall consider the recommendations of the zoning board of appeals but shall not be bound thereby. The date for the public hearing before the Town Council shall, whenever feasible, be set at the same time the hearing date is set for the zoning board of appeals, and may be included in the advertisement for the zoning board of appeals hearing, if known. One (1) additional advertisement of the public hearing before the Town Council shall be placed in a local newspaper approximately ten (10) days prior to the final public hearing. In making a final determination on approval, approval with conditions attached, or denial of any application for variance, the Town Council shall follow the same procedures and standards utilized by the zoning board of appeals as set forth herein. A final determination shall be made by the Town Council at the final public hearing and a written order shall be issued within ten (10) days of the hearing date. 
(4)  Violations; time limitations. Violations of such conditions and safeguards as prescribed by the Town Council when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and the variance shall be considered void. Variances shall become void if not exercised within six (6) months of the date granted. Before this six (6) month period has expired, the applicant may make a written request to the Town Council for an additional six (6) months extension. Any further extensions of time shall require a new application to be processed as a new case.

When an application for special exception is submitted to the Town, such application shall be submitted to the plan review committee for recommendation to the Town Council. Upon determination by the Town that the application is complete, a public hearing shall be set in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. 
(b)  Standards for granting special exceptions . Prior to recommending approval of a special exception, the Town Council shall insure that: 
(1)  All structures shall be separated from adjacent and nearby uses by appropriate screening devices.

In granting special exceptions, the Town Council may prescribe reasonable conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this chapter. A final determination shall be made by the Town Council on each application for special exception at the final public hearing and a written order shall be issued within ten (10) days of the hearing date. 
(d)  Violations; time limitations. Violations of such conditions and safeguards as prescribed by the Town Council, when made a part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and the special exception shall be considered void. Special exceptions shall become void if not exercised within six (6) months of the date granted. Before this six-month period has expired, the applicant may make a written request to the Town Council for an additional six (6) months' extension. Any further extensions of time shall require a new application to be processed as a new case.

(c)  Airport protection overlay zones . In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby created and established certain "protected zones" that include all lands in the town lying beneath the primary, runway protection, horizontal, conical, approach and transitional surfaces as they apply to a particular public-use airport. The boundaries of the airport protection overlay zone shall apply to all zoning classifications established in chapter 23 of the Town Code of Ordinances. An area located in more than one (1) of the airport protection overlay zones is considered to be in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The airport protection overlay zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Primary zone. A rectangular area located at each end of a runway, longitudinally centered on the runway. For hard surface runways, the primary surface extends two hundred (200) feet beyond each end. For runways without a hard surface, the primary zone ends at each runway end. The width depends on the existing or planned approach and runway type, as follows: 
a.  Precision instrument runways: One thousand (1,000) feet. 
b.  Non-precision instrument runways: Five hundred (500) feet. 
c.  Public utility visual runways: Two hundred fifty (250) feet. 
d.  Private utility visual runways: One hundred (100) feet. 
No structure or obstruction that is not part of the landing and takeoff area and is of a greater height than the nearest point on the runway centerline will be permitted within the primary zone. 
(2)  Runway protection zone. A trapezoidal area at ground level beginning two hundred (200) feet beyond the end of a runway and centered about the extended runway centerline, with the shortest side of the trapezoid closest to the runway. The runway protection zone dimension for a particular runway end is a function of the type of aircraft and approach visibility minimum associated with that runway end. Its width corresponds to that approach zone. Its length varies as follows: 
a.  Precision instrument runways: Two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet. 
b.  Non-precision instrument runways: One thousand (1,000) to one thousand seven hundred (1,700) feet. 
c.  Public utility visual runways: One thousand (1,000) feet. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. An area around each airport with an outer boundary, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs or specified radii from the center of each end of the primary zone of the airport's runways and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius for each arc for the horizontal surface is five thousand (5,000) feet for visual approach runways, and ten thousand (10,000) feet for all other approach types. The horizontal zone extends outward from the transitional zone to the edge of the conical zone. No structure or obstruction can extend one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation. 
(4)  Conical zone. The area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. Height limitations on structures or obstructions begin at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation at the inner edge, with permitted height increasing one (1) foot vertically for every twenty (20) feet of horizontal distance. 
(5)  Approach zone. An area longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, and extending outward and upward from the end of the runway's primary surface. The approach surface begins at the end of the primary surface. An approach zone is designated for each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. Permitted height limitation within the approach zones is the same as the runway end height at the inner edge and increases with horizontal distance outward from the inner edge as follows: 
a.  Precision instrument runways : Permitted height increases one (1) foot vertically for every fifty (50) feet horizontal distance for the first ten thousand (10,000) feet and then increases vertically for every forty (40) feet horizontal distance for an additional forty thousand (40,000) feet. 
b.  Non-precision instrument runways : Permitted height increases one (1) foot vertically for every thirty-four (34) feet horizontal distance for a total distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet. 
c.  Visual runways : Permitted height increases one (1) foot vertically for every twenty (20) feet horizontal distance for a total distance of five thousand (5,000) feet. 
(6)  Transitional zone. The area extending outward and upward at a 7:1 slope from the sides of the primary zones and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal zone. Height limits within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one (1) foot vertically for every seven (7) feet horizontally, extending out at right angles to the runway center line and extended center line for a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet. 
(d)  Permitting, administration and enforcement. 
(1)  Administration and enforcement. It shall be the duty of the town development services director or designee to administer and enforce the requirements prescribed herein within the territorial limits over which the town has jurisdiction through the permitting process. 
(2)  Permit required. Any person proposing to construct, alter, or allow an obstruction in an airport hazard area, as determined by the Federal Aviation Administration, shall apply for a building permit. No permit shall be issued if it would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or if it would permit a nonconforming obstruction to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable airport protection zoning regulation was adopted which allowed the establishment or creation of the obstruction, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
(3)  Permit application. In addition to the standard submittal documents associated with a building or development permit application, permit applications under this section shall include documentation showing compliance with the federal requirement for notification of proposed construction or alteration of structures and a valid aeronautical study. All such applications shall be accompanied by the appropriate review fee established by council resolution. 
(4)  Review criteria. The following criteria shall be considered when determining whether to issue or deny a permit: 
a.  The safety of persons on the ground and in the air; 
b.  The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace; 
c.  The nature of the terrain and height of existing structures; 
d.  The effect of the construction or alteration on the state licensing standards for a public-use airport contained in F.S. ch. 330 and rules adopted thereunder; 
e.  The character of existing and planned flight operations and developments at public-use airports; 
f.  Federal airways, visual flight rules, flyways and corridors, and instrument approaches as designed by the Federal Aviation Administration; 
g.  The effect of the construction or alteration of an obstruction on the minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport; and 
h.  The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing obstructions and all known proposed obstructions in the area. 
i.  Additional requirements adopted by the town or administrative agency pertinent to evaluation and protection of airspace and airport operations. 
(5)  State department of transportation review. Upon receipt of a complete permit application, a copy of the application shall be provided to the state department of transportation aviation office by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a delivery service that provides a receipt evidencing delivery. Pursuant to F.S. § 333.025(4), the department of transportation shall have fifteen (15) days to review the application and provide comments, if any, to the town, said time running concurrently with the review of the application by the town. 
(6)  Obstruction marking and lighting. The owner of a permitted obstruction shall be required to install, operate, and maintain thereon, at his or her own expense, marking and lighting in conformance with the specific standards set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(7)  Nonconforming uses. This section may not require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any obstruction not conforming to the regulation when adopted or amended, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use, except as provided in subsection 23-83(d)(2). 
(8)  Abandonment. A nonconforming obstruction that has been abandoned or is more than eighty (80) percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed shall not be granted a permit if it would allow the obstruction to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the airport protection zoning regulations. Whether or not an application is made for a permit under this section, the owner of the nonconforming obstruction may be required, at his or her own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, alter, or equip such obstruction as may be necessary to conform to the current airport protection zoning regulations. If the owner of the nonconforming obstruction neglects or refuses to comply with such requirement for ten (10) days after notice, the town may proceed to have the obstruction so lowered, removed, reconstructed, altered, or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owner of the obstruction or the land whereon it is or was located. 
(9)  Variances and modifications. Unless otherwise provided in this section, a petition for variance from the requirements of this section shall be governed by the provisions of section 23-63. 
(10)  Exemptions. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, the following activities and structures shall be exempt from the permitting requirements of this section: 
a.  Existing structures that received construction permits from the Federal Communications Commission that exceed federal obstruction standards before May 20, 1975. A permit is not required for any necessary replacement or repairs to such existing structures if the height and location are unchanged. 
b.  Nonsubstantial improvements of existing residential structures and parcels, and nonresidential structures or parcels provided the principal use of the property has not been is continued for a period of no less than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. 
c.  Cranes, construction equipment, and other temporary structures in use or in place for a period not to exceed eighteen (18) consecutive months are exempt from review by the state department of transportation, unless requested by the state department of transportation. 
(e)  Landfill regulations. 
(1)  New landfills shall not be located: 
a.  Within ten thousand (10,000) feet from the nearest point of any runway used or planned to be used by turbine aircraft; 
b.  Within five thousand (5,000) feet from the nearest point of any runway used by only nonturbine aircraft; 
c.  Outside the perimeters defined in subparagraphs a. and b., but still within the lateral limits of the civil airport imaginary surfaces defined in 14 C.F.R. § 77.19. Such landfills shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
(2)  The landfill operator of any landfill that is located and constructed in a manner that attracts or sustains hazardous bird movements from feeding, water, or roosting areas into or across the runways or approach and departure patterns of aircraft shall incorporate bird management techniques or other practices to minimize bird hazards to airborne aircraft. 
(3)  Where an airport authority or other governing body operating a public-use airport has conducted a noise study in accordance with 14 C.F.R. part 150, or where a public-use airport owner has established noise contours pursuant to another public study approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, the prohibition of incompatible uses, as established in the noise study in 14 C.F.R. part 150, Appendix A or as a part of an alternative Federal Aviation Administration-approved public study, within the noise contours established by any of these studies, except if such uses are specifically contemplated by such study with appropriate mitigation or similar techniques described in the study. 
(4)  Where an airport authority or other governing body operating a public-use airport has not conducted a noise study, the prohibition of residential construction and any educational facility, with the exception of aviation school facilities, within an area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half (1/2) the length of the longest runway on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline. 
(5)  The restriction of new incompatible uses, activities, or substantial modifications to existing incompatible uses within runway protection zones. 
(f)  Appeals and judicial review. 
(1)  Any person, political subdivision or administrative agency, or joint airport zoning board that contends a decision or determination on a permit made under this section is an improper application of airport zoning regulations shall use the process established for administrative review as set forth in section 23-63 of this chapter. 
(2)  The town council, in conformity with this section, may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision or determination on the permit or other determination from which the appeal is taken. 
(3)  Pursuant to the requirements of F.S. ch. 333 any person, political subdivision, or joint airport zoning board affected by a decision of the town council may apply for judicial relief to the circuit court within thirty (30) days after rendition of the town council's decision.

Sec. 23-130. - Downtown overlay design requirements. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of the downtown overlay design requirements is to provide a basis for evaluating redevelopment proposals and act as a guide for making decisions about public and private improvements within the downtown. The requirements promote the preservation and enhancement of the form, scale, and visual character that make the Lantana Downtown area unique within the Town and the region. It is the intent of the design requirements to ensure that each new building or public space will reinforce the Town center's unique identity. 
These requirements will be used as an overlay on the existing zoning categories. The requirements are the site design and building design standards for each of the current zoning sub-areas defined in subsection (b) below. 
In particular, the requirements are designed to support the following objectives in accordance with the Town of Lantana Comprehensive Plan: 
  Assure long-term economic vitality of the downtown area; 
  Create a vibrant mixed-use environment; 
  Create an aesthetically pleasing and vibrant pedestrian oriented town center; 
  Provide improved visual and physical connectivity between sub-areas; 
  Encourage the creation of exciting and inviting public urban spaces; 
  Develop an urban character that is unique to Lantana; 
  Provide interesting architectural design diversity within a continuity of urban design principals; 
  Provide safe, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing accommodations for vehicular access and parking; and 
  Provide incentives (road right-of-way, easements, etc....) for older sites to encourage redevelopment. 
(b)  Downtown overlay zone (DOZ) and sub-areas. The boundaries of the downtown overlay zone are: Lantana Road on the north; Pine Street on the south; Intracoastal Waterway on the east; and North Third Street south to Ocean and including four (4) parcels west of North Third Street, to the west.

(1)  Train depot sub-area (TD)-A mixed-use area with railroad station-based design criteria on the East side of Third St. between Ocean Avenue and Lantana Road; 
(2)  Dixie Highway Corridor mixed use sub-area (DC)-A mixed-use area on the east side of Dixie Highway from between Pine Street and Lantana Road, except the properties at the Ocean Avenue intersection; 
(3)  Cottage Commercial sub-area (CC)-A small-scale commercial area with retail shops, restaurants, offices with unique design criteria along Ocean Avenue between Oak Street and Lake Drive and including seven (7) lots south of Ocean Avenue on the west side of Oak Street; 
(4)  North Lake Drive sub-area (NL)-A multifamily area with design criteria along the East side of North Lake Drive and including eight (8) lots along the west side of North Lake and four (4) lots fronting on Oak Street, between the alley north of Ocean Avenue and Lantana Road; 
(5)  South Lake Drive sub-area (SL)-A single-family area along the East side of South Lake Drive; 
(6)  Ocean Avenue mixed use sub-area (OMX)-A mixed-use area with design criteria located along the Ocean Avenue corridor from Lake Drive eastward to the Town's public park and boat ramp; 
(7)  East Ocean Avenue public recreation sub-area (OPR)-A publicly-owned area along both sides of Ocean Avenue in which Sportsman Park and Bicentennial Park are located.

(Ord. No. O-08-2010, § 1(Exh. A), 7-12-10) 
Sec. 23-131. - Off-street parking and loading requirements. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. It is the intent of this section to provide for the health, safety, welfare and convenience of the public by requiring each development to provide on-site space and facilities for the parking, loading, queuing and on-site vehicular circulation demand it generates. All other town regulations in conflict with the minimum requirements of this section are hereby superseded to the extent that most stringent shall apply. 
(b)  General standards. 
(1)  Minimum standards. A minimum amount of area for off-street parking, loading and queuing shall be provided, and continuously maintained upon all developed lands in the Town as provided in this section. 
(2)  Access standards. Access to vehicular use areas shall conform to the standards established in this section. 
(3)  Construction and design standards. Each vehicular use area shall be constructed and maintained according to the standards established in this section. 
(4)  Parking design and relation to other uses. The design of vehicular use areas shall provide for logical, impediment free vehicular circulation and shall conform to the requirements of this section. 
(5)  Engineering expertise required. Where the responsibilities of the Plan Review Committee (PRC) require engineering expertise, the director shall consult with a licensed engineer. All costs associated with such consultation shall be borne by the applicant. 
(6)  Change of use. When the use of a portion or all of a structure or a lot, lot of record or parcel of land is changed, additional off-street parking facilities shall be provided to the extent that the off-street parking required for the new use exceeds the off-street parking for the previous use. Additionally, in accordance with the requirements of this section, no change or expansion of the use or structure on an existing site shall be permitted if such change results in either an increase in nonconformity (for sites already failing to satisfy the minimum off-street parking facilities requirements) or nonconformity with off-street parking facilities requirements. 
(c)  Off-street parking. 
(1)  Generally. The off-street parking standards of this section shall apply to all lands that are developed, to all lands on which a change of use occurs, or on which existing development is modified in any manner that changes or modifies the off-street parking requirements for that site. All off-street parking areas established by this section shall be continuously maintained according to the standards of this section. 
(2)  Parking is an accessory use. 
a.  Except as provided in subsection (c)(12) of this section (commercial lots), off-street parking shall be considered accessory to a principal land use. 
b.  Except as provided in subsection (c)(8)a of this section (shared parking) and subsection (c)(8)c of this section (valet parking), all accessory off-street parking shall be provided upon the same lot as the principal land use. 
(3)  Use of off-street parking. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided for the use of residents, customers, patrons and employees. Required parking spaces shall not be used for: 
a.  Outdoor storage of goods and materials; 
b.  Sale, repair or servicing of vehicles, other than on an emergency basis; or 
c.  Sale or display of goods or services. 
Required off-street parking spaces shall be free from encroachment of all structures. The location of required off-street parking shall not interfere with normal traffic flow, queuing and backup space. Required parking stalls and aisles shall not be used to park commercial vehicles conducting any business in the parking lot. A portion of the required parking stalls may be used on a temporary basis pursuant to a special permit issued by the development services department for the outdoor sale of goods, fairs and/or other temporary events. 
(4)  Parking in driveways in residential zoning districts. Driveways may be counted to satisfy minimum off-street parking standards for dwelling units provided: 
a.  The dwelling unit does not share the driveway with adjacent dwelling units; and 
b.  Sufficient space is available on the driveway to satisfy the residential parking space dimensional requirements of subsection (c)(9)c.1 of this section. 
(5)  Calculating minimum number of required off-street parking spaces. 
a.  Multiple land uses. Except as provided in subsection (c)(8)a of this section (shared parking), when more than one land use occupies the same structure or lot, the total number of required parking spaces shall be the sum of the required off-street parking spaces for each land use as if provided separately. 
b.  Fractional requirements. When the calculation of the number of required off-street parking spaces results in a fractional number, a fraction of one-half space or greater shall require one full additional space. 
c.  Calculations based on number of employees or occupants. When the calculation of parking spaces is based in whole or in part upon the number of employees or persons occupying or residing on premises, the calculation of the minimum number of spaces shall be based upon the maximum number of employees or persons on duty or legally residing on the premises at any one time. 
d.  Calculations based on number of seats. When the calculation of parking spaces is based in whole or in part upon the number of seats, each 22 inches of lineal length on a bench, pew, or similar seating facility shall be considered to be one seat. 
e.  Calculations based on gross lot area. When the calculation of parking spaces is based upon gross lot area, the amount of lot area dedicated to off-street parking shall not be included in the calculation. 
f.  Uncertainty or indefiniteness about a land use. If the standard for the number of parking spaces for a particular land use is not included in this section, the standards for the most nearly comparable land use shall be applied by the development services director. In making this determination, the development services shall consider such factors as evidence of actual parking demand for similar land uses and such other reliable traffic engineering and planning information which may be available. 
g.  Additions to existing development. Off-street parking facilities shall be provided for any new building constructed, for any addition or enlargement of an existing building or use, or any change of occupancy or manner of operation that would result in additional parking spaces being required in excess of the number of existing parking spaces. The additional parking shall be required only for such addition, enlargement, or change, and not for the entire building or use. 
h.  Inadequate information at the time of request for zoning action. The determination of the actual number of required off-street parking spaces may be delayed until the submission of certified building plans in the following instances: 
1.  Where the formula for determining the minimum number of parking spaces is comprised of two or more different rates, and there is uncertainty about how some or all floor or lot area shall be used; or 
2.  When it is unknown which portions of a structure are to be deleted from gross floor area to calculate gross leasable floor area. 
If the added calculation of off-street parking spaces is delayed, an estimate of the number of required off-street parking spaces shall be accepted based on a preliminary plan using the applicable formula until the submission of certified building plans. 
(6)  Retention of off-street parking spaces. Required off-street parking spaces shall not be reduced in size, eliminated or made unusable in any manner, except as provided in subsection (c)(8)a of this section (shared parking). 
a.  Restriction to require off-street parking by fee. Except as provided in subsection (c)(8)a of this section (shared parking), subsection (c)(8)c of this section (valet parking), and subsection (c)(12) of this section (public, private or commercial lots), access to the minimum number of public parking spaces required by this section shall not be restricted by fees or other forms of compensation. Access to parking spaces provided in excess of the minimum standards of this section may be controlled by means of fees. 
(7)  Minimum number of required off-street parking spaces by land use. Unless otherwise provided in this section, the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for each land use is identified below in Schedule 23-131.1. A portion of the minimum number of required parking spaces may be used to satisfy the minimum number of required handicapped spaces required in subsection (c)(8)b of this section.

(2)  Space within a carport or garage may be counted. No building permit may be issued to convert a carport or garage to living area without provision for adequate parking spaces in the driveway or a common parking lot. Space to park all vehicles must be provided on the lot. All required parking shall be paved. 
(3)  Guest parking spaces may be grouped, provided that the spaces are located within three hundred (300) feet of the dwellings that they are intended to serve. Each space shall be provided with a wheel stop. All guest parking shall be prominently identified with an above grade sign or marking on the wheel stop. 
(4)  Vehicles shall not be stored in view. A fence or vegetation may be used to screen the vehicles from view. 
(5)  If a convenience store is associated with the service station, then one-half of the additional spaces will be adjacent to the store. 
(6)  Based on warehouse space. 
(7)  Such facilities shall provide clear ingress and egress and a convenient passenger drop-off area located adjacent to the building and out of the primary travel lanes. 
(8)  If service is a direct service provider and is frequented on a daily basis by the general public, then four spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of customer service space shall be provided. 
(8)  Special regulations for off-street parking. 
a.  Combined parking. Shared parking shall be allowed with the approval of the plan review committee, and shall be consistent with the following standards: 
1.  General. All land uses which participate in a single shared parking plan shall be located on the same lot, or on lots which share a common boundary. The parking lot shall be developed and used as though the land uses on the lots were a single unit. 
2.  Unity of title. A shared parking plan shall be enforced through unity of title. 
3.  Open space reserved for parking for all land uses. Enough land shall be reserved as open space to provide for the combined parking requirements of each land use, or an alternate plan may be provided, such as a plan to convert an existing lot to a structure. If reserved as open space, the reserved area shall not be used for on-site retention of stormwater runoff nor be counted to fulfill any landscaping requirements of the Town Code of Ordinances. Additionally, preservation areas designated and protected by any government shall not be used to satisfy this reserve requirement. The reserved area shall be landscaped and maintained to present an orderly appearance. 
4.  Combined parking study. A combined parking study acceptable to the development services director shall be submitted that clearly establishes which and what types of land uses will use the combined available spaces at what times of the day, week, month or year. The study shall: 
i.  Be based on the Urban Land Institute's methodology for determining combined parking or other generally accepted methodology; 
ii.  Address size and type of activities, composition of tenants, rate of turnover for proposed combined spaces, and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads to be encountered; 
iii.  Provide for reduction of paved area by not more than one-half (1/2) of the combined parking required for each use under subsection (c)(7) of this section; 
iv.  Provide for reduction of any required handicapped spaces; 
v.  Provide a plan to convert the open space reserved pursuant to subsection (c)(8)a.3 of this section to parking area. It may provide for construction of a parking structure to meet combined parking requirements; and 
vi.  Be approved by the development services director based on feasibility of the land uses to use combined parking due to their particular peak parking and trip generation characteristics. 
5.  Use change. Should any of the uses be changed, or the Town find that any of the conditions described in the approved shared parking study no longer exist, the owner of record shall have the option of submitting a revised parking study in accordance with the requirements of this section or providing on-site the required number of spaces for each use. 
b.  Handicapped parking. All handicapped parking regulations shall be governed by F.S. §§ 316.1957 and 553.511, and any rules promulgated thereunder, and such parking shall be paved. 
c.  Valet parking. Valet parking may be used upon any lot to satisfy, in part, off-street parking standards. The design of valet parking shall not cause customers who do not use the valet service to park off-premises or in the right-of-way or cause queuing in the right-of-way. In addition: 
1.  Maximum number of reserved stalls. A maximum of fifty (50) percent of the required off-street parking spaces may be reserved for valet parking. 
2.  Location of reserved stalls. Stalls reserved for valet parking may be located anywhere on site, except that handicapped parking spaces shall be the spaces located closest to the nearest accessible entrance of the building that the parking spaces are intended to serve. 
3.  Valet parking permit required. 
i.  A valet parking permit must be obtained from the Town by anyone desiring to provide valet parking using a public area for a staging area, for storing patrons' vehicles, or for traveling to or from storage or staging areas. A separate valet parking permit shall be required for each valet operation and for each staging area. All permits must be renewed annually and a renewal fee will be charged. 
4.  Valet parking permit application process and requirements. 
i.  Application process. 
a.  Prospective valet operators shall submit an application for a revocable valet parking permit to the Town, accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee, for each staging area at which valet parking is desired. The form of the application shall be supplied by the Town. A valet parking plan which accurately depicts the existing streetscape, surrounding streets, parking spaces and other physical elements that will be in the immediate area of the valet operation, as well as the travel route diagram and a travel time estimate, must be attached to the completed application form. 
b.  Within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of a complete application the Town shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. The town shall make this determination based on the criteria established herein. Notice of the decision shall be mailed to the applicant. 
c.  If an application is denied, an applicant must resubmit within fourteen (14) business days a revised application which modifies responses to those areas of concern which caused the application to be initially denied. No other resubmissions will be allowed without the express consent of the Town development services director. Failure to resubmit within fourteen (14) business days of the denial notice will result in a final denial. However, an applicant may subsequently reapply at any time without prejudice upon payment of a new application fee. 
d.  The decision of the Town to deny an application for a valet parking permit may be appealed by the applicant to the Town commission. The appeal must be submitted to the office of the Town auditor and clerk within fourteen (14) business days of the day the notice of decision was mailed to the applicant. 
ii.  Requirements for approval. 
a.  The town shall issue a valet parking permit to an applicant or renew a valet parking permit, if applicable, based upon a determination that the requirements of this section have been or will be fully satisfied. 
b.  Staging area. The staging area shall be no less than forty (40) feet in length if located on private property or forty-six (46) feet in length if on public right-of-way. The staging area shall be no less than ten (10) feet and no more than twenty (20) feet in width. The staging area shall not be located: 
1.  Closer than thirty (30) feet to the intersection of any two (2) or more streets; 
2.  On the same town block as any other valet operation; or 
3.  On the opposite town block face of any other valet operation. 
4.  Within handicapped accessible spaces or diagonal or angled parking spaces. Only parallel parking spaces may be used for a staging area. 
c.  Travel routes. Travel routes used for the transportation of vehicles between staging and storage areas shall comply with all traffic control regulations or devices and shall minimize any impediment to normal traffic flow. 
d.  Attendants. An adequate number of attendants shall be provided to prevent any impediment to normal traffic flow or the illegal parking of vehicles. 
e.  Insurance and indemnification. 
1.  The applicant/valet operator shall submit certificates of insurance to the Town's risk manager evidencing coverage for each valet operation that meets the following requirements: 
i.  Commercial general liability coverage in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per incident with a two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) maximum aggregate and naming the Town of Lantana, its departments, agents, officials and employees as additional insureds; 
ii.  If applicable, garage keepers liability coverage in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence. 
iii.  Policies shall provide that coverage cannot be canceled, materially modified or nonrenewed without providing the Town at least thirty (30) days prior written notice; and shall be issued by companies rated A.M. Best A- or better per Best's Rating Guide, latest edition. 
2.  The valet operator shall give written notice to the Town within five (5) calendar days of the date on which total claims by any party against the valet operator reduce the aggregate amount of coverage below the amounts required by this section. 
3.  A permit shall be automatically suspended without any requirement for action by the Town or notice to the valet operator for any period of time that any of the insurance required by this section is not in effect. In addition, the Town may cause the permit to be revoked for failure to maintain insurance pursuant to this section. 
4.

(a)  Open air junk yards, salvage yards, and/or scrap metal yards as hereinafter defined, whether operated as primary or accessory uses are hereby prohibited within the Town. Such storage uses, where otherwise permitted by this code, shall be permitted only when such use is entirely covered by a building conforming to the requirements of the building code of the Town.

Sec. 23-137. - Nonconforming status. 
    Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structure in combination, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment thereto.

(c)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Town Council shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Town Council may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; further, the applicant must meet all general standards for special exceptions as specifically set forth in Article IV of this chapter. 
(d)  Any structure or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which the structure is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
