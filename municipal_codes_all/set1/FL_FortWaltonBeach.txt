PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were furnished electronically by the City of Fort Walton Beach. The source of each section is included in the Table of Historical Notes and References following each chapter. The absence of a section in the table indicates that the section remains unchanged from the original codification. The text and tables of this Code were furnished electronically by the City of Fort Walton Beach. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the chapter, section, and subsection. Thus, section 6.04.050 is subsection .050, located in section 6.04 of chapter 6. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and sections are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Kayla Jewell, Editor, and Aline True, Quality Control Supervisor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kim Barnes, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

The present municipality of the City of Fort Walton is hereby abolished and in the place of the same municipality there is hereby created and established a municipality under the name of Fort Walton Beach within the territorial boundaries of the said City of Fort Walton as now established or as there may hereafter be established, the said Fort Walton Beach to succeed to and take the place of the abolished City of Fort Walton. The municipal corporation hereby established and created shall have perpetual succession, may use a common seal, may contract and be contracted with, and may sue and be impleaded in all matters whatsoever.  
Section 2. - Validation of ordinances, property rights, liabilities, etc. 
All laws, by-laws, resolutions and ordinances lawfully passed and in force in the City of Fort Walton under its former charter, not in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this charter, shall remain in force until repealed or altered in accordance with the provisions of this act. All rights, actions, prosecutions, contracts, and power and property of every description which were vested in it are vested in it under the charter herein provided for, as though there had been no change in form of government, and no neglect or liability, either in favor of or against the city, and no suit or prosecution of any kind, shall be affected by such change, unless expressly provided by the terms of this act.  
TITLE II. - LEGISLATIVE 
 
Section 3. - Creation and composition of council. 
Except as otherwise provided in this charter, all powers of the city shall be vested in a council of seven members who are elected at-large. The term of all councilmembers shall be for four (4) years, and an election shall be held each two (2) years for the purpose of electing members of the council as the terms expire. Until such elected members of the council shall take office, the present members of the council of the City of Fort Walton Beach shall continue in office until the expiration of their present terms of office. Members of the council shall be qualified electors of the city, and have resided in the city for at least six (6) months prior to qualifying for an elected office of the City of Fort Walton Beach with the Okaloosa County Supervisor of Election, and shall not hold any other city, state or federal office, except that of notary public or member of the state militia or member of the reserve forces of the United States. A member of the council ceasing to possess any of the qualifications specified in this section or convicted of crime, while in office, shall immediately forfeit his office.  
Section 4. - Limit on number of terms for city council and mayor. 
No person shall be elected to the office of city council or mayor of the City of Fort Walton Beach for more than two consecutive full terms.  
Section 5. - Filling vacancies in the city council or in the office of mayor. 
(a)  In the event a vacancy occurs on the city council, or in the office of mayor, after election of a person to fill the office concerned, the position shall be filled as follows: 
(1)  If a person elected has not yet been sworn into office, the office shall not be filled until that person would ordinarily have been sworn in. The council taking its seat at the time that person would have been sworn in shall determine the successor, by majority vote. 
(2)  If the person elected has been sworn into office, and if more than sixty (60) days remain before the next primary election to be held within the City of Fort Walton Beach, then that vacancy shall be filled by a vote of the majority of the council then sitting. 
(3)  Prior to any appointment by council, nominations shall be accepted during at least the two (2) general meetings following creation of the vacancies. The city council shall appoint the person to fill the vacancy at the third regular meeting after the vacancy is created. Voting will be confined only to those persons who were nominated and discussed at either or both the public meetings at which nominations were accepted. 
(4)  If fewer than sixty (60) days remain before the next primary election, no successor shall be appointed unless no one qualifies to run for the vacant position. 
(b)  All vacancies which occur on the city council, or in the office of mayor, shall be filled by majority vote of the council, but only until the next election held in the city. 
(c)  Whether or not the seat becoming vacant has been sworn into office, the appointment by a majority of the council shall be for a period extending only until the beginning of the first regular meeting after a successor is chosen by election as provided herein. That seat shall be open for qualification in the next election beginning sixty (60) days before the first primary and ending thirty (30) days before the first primary. Those candidates qualifying for that position shall run in a nonpartisan election. The candidate who receives a majority of the votes cast shall be elected to that position. In the event no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, then the two (2) candidates with the highest number of votes will participate in a runoff to be held at the next primary election, or if none, at the general election. The winner of that election shall fill the balance of the term of the seat in which the vacancy occurred.  
Section 6. - Regular and special meetings of council. 
On the first day of July, 1956, and thereafter on the first day of April in the years in which there are elections of councilmembers, the council shall meet in the council chamber of the city hall, and the newly elected members shall assume the duties of office. Thereafter the council shall meet at such times as may be prescribed by resolution. Special meetings shall be called by the clerk upon written request of the mayor, city manager or three members of the council. Any such notice shall state the subject or subjects to be considered. All meetings of the council and of the committees thereof shall be open to the public, and rules of the council shall provide that the citizens of the city shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard at any such meetings in regard to any matter considered thereat. Notice may be waived by written waiver signed by all members.  
Section 7. - Election of mayor and mayor pro tem; general duties of mayor. 
The mayor shall be elected by the qualified voters of the city at large every four (4) years. The mayor pro tem shall be chosen by and from the members of the council. In addition to the powers conferred on the mayor by this charter, the mayor shall also have the rights, privileges and immunities of a member of the council except that the mayor shall have the right to cast a deciding vote should any issue before the members of the city council end in a tie vote. The mayor shall be subject to the same prohibitions against interfering with or suggesting to the city manager. The mayor shall preside at meetings of the council and shall also have the power and perform the duties conferred and imposed by the charter and the ordinances of the city. The mayor shall be recognized as the head of the city government for all ceremonial purposes, by the courts for serving civil processes, and by the governor for purpose of military law. In time of public danger or emergency the mayor shall, if so authorized and directed by vote of the council, take command of the police, maintain order and enforce the law.  
Section 8. - General powers and rules of council. 
The council shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its members and, in such cases, shall have power to subpoena witnesses and compel the production of all pertinent books, records and papers, but the decision of the council, in any case, shall be subject to review by the courts. The council shall determine its own rules and order of business and keep a journal of its proceedings. It shall have power to compel the attendance of absent members, may punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, by vote of not less than six (6) members, may expel a member for disorderly conduct or the violation of its rules, but no member shall be expelled unless notified of the charges and given an opportunity to be heard in their own defense.  
Section 9. - Quorum; compelling attendance of members. 
A majority of the members elected to the council shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a lesser number may adjourn from time to time to compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner and under such penalties as may be prescribed by ordinance. No member shall be excused from voting, except on matters involving the consideration of their own official conduct, or when their financial interests are involved.  
Section 10. - Investigations of transactions of departments and officials. 
The council, the mayor or any committee, duly authorized and appointed by council or the mayor to do so, may investigate the financial transactions of any office or department of the city government and the official acts of any city official, and by similar investigation may secure information upon any matter relating to the city's business. In conducting such investigations the council, the mayor or any committee duly appointed may require the attendance of witnesses and production of books, papers, electronic files and other evidence, and for that purpose may issue subpoenas which shall be signed by the presiding officer of the council, the mayor or the chairperson of such committee, as the case may be, which may be served and executed by any police officer.

Section 17. - Administrative departments. 
There shall be such departments, boards and authorities as may be established by ordinance for the purposes of carrying out the legal, financial, public safety, public service and welfare functions of the city. The council may change any department, board, authority or office by ordinance and may prescribe, distribute or discontinue the functions and duties of departments, boards, authorities and offices so established, with the exception of the police or fire department, which shall require either a unanimous vote of the council or require a public referendum to discontinue. Additional functions and duties may be assigned by ordinance to departments, boards and authorities established by this charter, and departments, boards and authorities may be discontinued or the functions thereof changed by ordinance.  
Section 18. - Departments to be supervised by a director. 
At the head of each department there shall be a director who shall have the supervision and control thereof.

A member may be declared ineligible for disability benefits only at the time of the board's acceptance of membership in the plan, or at a later date if the board establishes that a condition existed at the time of the member's employment, and such declaration shall be recorded on the member's record of membership, a copy of which shall be provided to the member.

Each Firefighter trustee shall serve as Trustee for a period of two (2) years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the City as a Firefighter or his position as Trustee, whereupon his successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing member. Each Firefighter may succeed himself in office. The Board of Trustees shall meet at least quarterly each year. Each Board of Trustees shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
(2)  The Trustees shall by a majority vote elect a chairman and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board. The Trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
(3)  Each Trustee shall be entitled to one (1) vote on the board. Three (3) affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the Trustees at any meeting of the board. A Trustee shall have the right to abstain from voting as the result of a conflict of interest provided he complies with the provisions of F.S. § 112.3143.

(6)  The Board of Trustees shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The Board of Trustees shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event, to the authority and power of the Fort Walton Beach City Council to amend or terminate this Trust, provided that no amendment or plan termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this plan except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this plan.

The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the Trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the plan which it may deem to be to the best interest of the plan to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as Trustee under this Ordinance, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the City, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the plan to a member or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board.

For all other purposes of the plan, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions.

(h)  Disability. 
(1)  Disability Benefits On-Duty. Each member in the pension plan and who shall have become totally and permanently disabled while an active member of the Fort Walton Beach Fire Department to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Firefighter which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a Firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in no event shall the minimum amount paid to the member be less than fifty percent (50%) of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by tuberculosis, hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Disability Benefits Off-Duty. Each member in the pension plan with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall have become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Firefighter wherein such disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a Firefighter shall be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in no event shall the amount paid to the member be less than twenty-five percent (25%) of his average final compensation. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(3)  Conditions Disqualifying Disability Benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the Board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
a.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, narcotics or intoxicants. 
b.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections. 
c.  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime. 
d.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
e.  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a member with the City of Fort Walton Beach shall have terminated. 
(4)  Physical Examination Requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. 
Any member receiving disability benefits under provisions of this Ordinance may be periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If, prior to the member's normal retirement date, the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled, the board shall recommend to the City that the member be returned to the performance of duty as a member. In the event the retiree is ordered to return and shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit his right to all benefits under this plan. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming and/or receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the board of this pension plan. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as but not limited to transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the board. 
If the member recovers from disability and re-enters service as a member with the City, his service shall be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the City shall not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the plan. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(5)  Disability Payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of his disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the Board of Trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment shall be: 
a.  If the member recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
b.  If the member dies without recovering from his disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
A disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit as described in subsection (j)(1)b., which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of disability benefit. 
(i)  Vesting. If a member terminates his employment with the Fire Department, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this plan, he shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contribution or he may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has more than ten (10) years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent (2.50%) of his average final compensation for each year of credited service payable commencing at his otherwise normal retirement date, or as reduced for early retirement as provided in section (f) of this ordinance, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided he survives to his normal retirement date. 
(j)  Optional Forms of Benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a Firefighter, upon written request to the Board of Trustees, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
a.  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the Firefighter for his lifetime only. 
b.  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the Firefighter during the lifetime of the Firefighter and following the death of the Firefighter, 100%, 75%, 66.66% or 50% of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the Retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
c.  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his Beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated joint pensioner or beneficiary, but only if the board consents to such change; provided however, in no event may a member change his or her joint pensioner or designated beneficiary more than twice after retirement benefits have commenced. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(3)  The consent of a Firefighter's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the plan shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a member's beneficiary or joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the board shall adjust the member's monthly benefit by application of actuarial calculations to insure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the member's then-current benefit. Any such member shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses and shall make repayment of any overage of previously-paid pension benefits as a result of said recalculations. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the Board of Trustees and on completion will be filed with the Board of Trustees. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the Firefighter, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the Firefighter subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section (k). 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
a.  If a Firefighter dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section (g). 
b.  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the Firefighter's retirement under the plan, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the Firefighter upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the Firefighter prior to his retirement and within ninety (90) days after the death of the beneficiary. 
c.  If both the retired Firefighter and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the Board of Trustees may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section (k). 
d.  If a Firefighter continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f)(1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the Firefighter in the amount or amounts computed as if the Firefighter had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
e.  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70½) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the City. 
(6)  A Firefighter may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(k)  Beneficiaries. 
(1)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(2)  If a deceased member or retiree fails to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (1), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predecease the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the plan with respect to such deceased member or retiree shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(3)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(l)  Claims Procedures. 
(1)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("Claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(2)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(m)  Reports to Division of Retirement. Each year and no later than March 15th, the board shall file an annual report with the Division of Retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 175. 
(n)  Roster of Retirees. The Secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this Ordinance in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the Secretary shall keep a record of all members employed by the municipality in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date such employment is terminated. 
(o)  Maximum Pension. 
(1)  Basic Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the plan shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this plan. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to Basic Limitation for Form of Benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
a.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent (5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
b.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one half percent (5.5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the Plan Year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
c.  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections a. and b. above. 
(3)  Benefits Not Taken into Account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under §415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
c.  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
a.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
b.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
c.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the System in any-limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the plan, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other Adjustments in Limitations. 
a.  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
b.  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the City, the adjustments provided for in a. above shall not apply. 
c.  The reductions provided for in a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to susection (h), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to subsection (g). 
d.  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
6.  Less than Ten (10) Years of Participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below 10% of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to subsection (h), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to subsection (g). 
(7)  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000) Limit; Less Than Ten Years of Service. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (o), the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this System and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the City has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated 
(9)  Reduction of Benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service Credit Purchase Limits. 
a.  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the Plan, as allowed in subsections (u) and (v), then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
3.  For purposes of applying subparagraph 1., the plan will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subparagraph and for purposes of applying subparagraph (2) the Plan will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
1.  Recognized by the plan for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the plan, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the Plan, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause b.2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the plan. 
(11)  Contribution Limits. 
a.  For purposes of applying the limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the plan, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 2½ months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
(a)  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
(b)  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under the definition of "Salary" in subsection (a), Definitions. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a Member to make a contribution to the plan if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph 1. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
c.  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
d.  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (11) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(12)  Additional Limitation on Pension Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
a.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the plan and who has not previously participated in such plan, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
b.  No member of the plan shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of Direct Rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(p)  Commencement of Benefits. 
(1)  Unless the member otherwise elects, with such election being in writing and to the Trustees and specifying the form of retirement income and date on which the retirement income is to commence, the payment benefits under the plan to the member shall commence not later than the 60th day after the close of the plan year in which the latest of the following events occur: 
a.  The attainment by the member of age sixty-five (65); 
b.  The 10th anniversary of the date on which the member commenced participation in the plan; or 
c.  The termination of the member's service with the City. 
(2)  If the payment of a member's retirement income cannot begin on the date required under subsection (1) of this section because the Trustees either cannot ascertain the amount of the member's retirement income or cannot locate the member after making reasonable efforts to do so, the payment of the member's benefit shall begin not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the amount can be ascertained or the member is located, whichever is applicable. Any such payment shall be made retroactive to a date which is not earlier than the date on which the payment of the member's benefit was scheduled to begin but which is not later than the date specified under subsection (1) of this section. 
(q)  Minimum Distribution of Benefits. 
(1)  General Rules. 
a.  Effective Date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
b.  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
c.  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (1)c., distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(2)  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
a.  Required Beginning Date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70 ½) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the City. 
b.  Death of Member Before Distributions Begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (70 ½), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (2)b., other than subsection (2)b.1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (2)b., distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (2)b.4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1., the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
c.  Death After Distributions Begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
d.  Form of Distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year. 
a.  General Requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
2.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to subsection (f), subsection (g), subsection (i), or subsection (j) (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
b.  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection (g)) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

a.  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
b.  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five (25%) of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(5)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations.

(r)  Miscellaneous Provisions. 
(1)  Interest of Members in System. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(2)  No Reduction of Accrued Benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the City Council of the City of Fort Walton Beach which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(3)  Qualification of System. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(4)  Use of Forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future City contributions.

(6)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended.

a.  Member will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
b.  A member will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(8)  Electronic Forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)-21. 
(s)  Repeal or Termination of Plan. 
(1)  This ordinance establishing the plan and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said plan and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  If this ordinance shall be repealed, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, the board shall continue to administer the plan in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this ordinance who are designated by any of said members.

The board shall inform the City if additional assets are required, in which event the City shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
b.  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each Firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection c. 
c.  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection b. involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the Firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the Firefighter. 
d.  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection c., and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the City, less return to the State of the State's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the City and the State to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the City and the State. 
e.  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection b., the amounts determined under subsection c. 
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the City or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

b.  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order.

Chapter 175, and to make any payments for child support or alimony.

a.  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed had he been a member of the plan for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service.

(4)  Any member who has received benefits from the plan in excess of his accumulated contributions after his rights were forfeited shall be required to pay back to the fund the amount of the benefits received in excess of his accumulated contributions.

(z)  Direct Transfers of Eligible Rollover Distributions; Elimination of Mandatory Distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distribution. 
a.  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
b.  Definitions. 
1.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributes will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
2.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1,2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code; or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
3.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
4.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(2)  Rollovers or Transfers into the Fund. On or after January 1,2002, the plan will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
a.  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The plan will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The plan will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
b.  Member Rollover Contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(3)  Elimination of Mandatory Distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(aa)  Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(1)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following definitions apply: 
a.  DROP: The Fort Walton Beach Firefighters' Pension Trust Fund Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
b.  DROP Account: The account established for each DROP participant under subsection (3).

c.  Period of Participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (2)b., shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 36 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall be irrevocable and shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the City not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. Under no circumstances may a member continue employment with the City as a firefighter after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation. A member may participate only once. 
d.  Termination of Participation. 
1.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
(a)  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (2)c.; or 
(b)  Termination of his employment as a Firefighter.

3.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (2)d. shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
e.  Effect of DROP Participation on the plan. 
1.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the plan shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the plan (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the plan) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the plan, the City shall not continue to contribute to the plan on his behalf for future accruals, nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits. 
(2)  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the plan while the member is a participant in the DROP. If a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a Firefighter, no amounts shall be paid to him from the plan until he terminates his employment as a Firefighter. Amounts transferred from the plan to the member's DROP Account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a Firefighter. 
(3)  Funding. 
a.  Establishment of DROP Account. A DROP Account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP Account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (3)b., and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
b.  Transfers From Retirement Plan. 
1.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the plan had he terminated his employment as a Firefighter and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP Account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (2)d.2. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (2)c. and (2)d., but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a Firefighter. 
2.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2)d.2., during a member's participation in the DROP, the Member's monthly retirement benefit will be paid into the DROP account. The member's DROP account will increase in value at a rate equal to one-half percent (50%) of the assumed rate of return on pension fund investments during the immediately preceding plan year. The interest rate on the DROP account will be established by the pension board as of February 1 each year. The interest rate may be adjusted up or down during a member's participation in the DROP, which will result in a change in the prospective interest rate credit on the member's DROP account. 
3.  A member's DROP Account shall only be credited with interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous month and prior to distribution. 
(4)  Distribution of DROP Accounts on Termination of Employment. 
a.  Eligibility for Benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP Account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection upon his termination of employment as a Firefighter.

2.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP Account shall be paid to his Beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP Account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
c.  Date of Payment of Distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (4), distribution of a member's DROP Account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designed by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
d.  Proof of Death and Right of Beneficiary or Other Person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP Account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
e.  Distribution Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (4), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "Minimum Distribution of Benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
f.  Direct Rollover of Certain Distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the plan in subsection (y). 
(5)  Administration of DROP. 
a.  Board Administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as Trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A Trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
b.  Individual Accounts, Records and Reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP Account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
c.  Establishment of Rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP'S assets. 
d.  Limitation of Liability. 
1.  The Trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
2.  Neither the board nor any Trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(6)  General Provisions. 
a.  The DROP Is Not a Separate Retirement Plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the System may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP Account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP Account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
b.  Notional Account. The DROP Account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the System. There is no change in the System's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The Member has no control over the investment of the DROP Account. 
c.  No Employer Discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
d.  IRC Limit. The DROP Account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the System, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
e.  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the City at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP Account of any member. 
f.  Facility of Payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
g.  Information. Each Member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
h.  Prevention of Escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three (3) years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the City. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three (3) months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
i.  Written Elections, Notification. 
1.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
2.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP Account shall be responsible for furnishing THE Board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
j.  Benefits Not Guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP Account and neither the City nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
k.  Construction. 
1.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
2.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
l.  Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the PLAN. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits.

(a)  Definitions. As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions with interest at the rate of three percent (3%) per annum. Interest accrues only during periods when a member is accruing credited service. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions without the crediting of interest of three percent (3%) per annum. 
Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation report approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the City pursuant to the recommendation of the board using assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to City discretion. 
Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the highest five (5) years out of the last fifteen (15) years of credited service prior to retirement prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time Police Officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
Board means the Board of Trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
City means City of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. 
Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
Credited Service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a Police Officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the City as a Police Officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the Police Department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a Police Officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the System. If a vested member leaves the employ of the Police Department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a Police Officer with the Police Department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the Board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the System are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a Police Officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the Police Officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment. 
The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "Qualified Military Service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L.103-353), after separation from employment as a Police Officer with the City, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
A.  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
B.  The member returns to his employment as a Police Officer within one (1) year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
C.  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five (5) years. 
D.  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the City or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
Member means an actively employed Police Officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by City ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
Plan year means the twelve (12) month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
Police Officer means an actively employed full-time person, employed by the City, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a Police Officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic, or highway laws of the State of Florida. 
Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
Retirement means a member's separation from City employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
Salary means the total cash remuneration paid to the Police Officer for services rendered to the City as a Police Officer. For service earned on or after July 1, 2011, salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year accrued as of July 1, 2011 and attributable to service earned prior to the July 1, 2011, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after July 1, 2011. Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable.

Member contributions withheld by the City on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to §414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
b.  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(2)  State Contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for Police Officers of the City shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this System immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the City. 
(3)  City Contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the City shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required City contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(4)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required City contributions.

A Member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal: 
a.  For those members who retire on or before April 5, 1999, two and one-half percent (2.5%) of average final compensation for each year of credited service, not to exceed thirty (30) years of credited service. An employee shall not contribute to the plan after attaining thirty (30) years of credited service, and the period of average final compensation shall be those years immediately prior to the actual retirement date. 
b.  For those members who retire after April 5, 1999, two and three-fourths percent (2.75%) of average final compensation for each year of credited service, up to a maximum of seventy-five percent (75%) of average final compensation. A member shall contribute one-half of one percent (.5%) of compensation as defined in this section to the plan after accruing the maximum benefit percentage, and the period of average final compensation shall be those years immediately prior to the actual retirement date. 
c.  The normal retirement for a member who retires under this section shall in no event be less than two percent (2%) of average final compensation for each year of credited service. 
(3)  Early Retirement Date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service or the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service, regardless of age. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the City on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(4)  Early Retirement Benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
a.  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a Police Officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
b.  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph a. above, reduced by six percent (6%) for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a Police Officer. 
(5)  Required Distribution Date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70½) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the City. 
(6)  Cost of Living Adjustment. Each April 1st, the monthly amount payable to a retiree, normal and early service retirees, his joint pensioner or beneficiary, if applicable, is adjusted in accordance with the CPI increase during the previous calendar year. The cost-of-living adjustment (increase or decrease, whichever is applicable) shall not exceed three percent (3%) and no cost-of-living adjustment can reduce the retirement income payments below the base amount payable. 
(g)  Pre-Retirement Death. 
(1)  Prior to Vesting or Eligibility for Retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of one hundred percent (100%) of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(2)  Deceased Members Vested or Eligible for Retirement with Spouse as Beneficiary. This subsection (2) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
c.  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection (j)(7). 
d.  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in a. or b. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
e.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (70½). 
f.  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection a. or b. above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(3)  Deceased Members Vested or Eligible for Retirement with Non-Spouse Beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
c.  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection (j)(7). 
d.  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in a. or b. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
e.  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection a. or b. above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
f.  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
g.  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(h)  Disability. 
(1)  Disability Benefits In-Line of Duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a Police Officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and three-quarters percent (2.75%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be not less than fifty percent (50%) of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  In-Line of Duty Presumptions. 
a.  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
b.  Additional Presumption. The presumption provided for in this paragraph b. shall apply only to those conditions described in this paragraph b. that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (2)b., the following definitions apply: 
(a)  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
(b)  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full time by the City as a police officer, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. Chapter 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
(c)  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
(d)  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
(e)  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
(a)  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
(b)  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
(c)  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the City to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of Exposures. The City shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the City of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
(a)  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
(b)  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(3)  Disability Benefits Not-in-Line of Duty. Any member with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a Police Officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and three-quarters percent (2.75%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be not be less than forty percent (40%) of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(4)  Conditions Disqualifying Disability Benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
a.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
b.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
c.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
d.  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a Police Officer with the City of Fort Walton Beach shall have terminated. 
e.  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the City and arising out of such employment. 
(5)  Physical Examination Requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this ordinance may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer, the board shall recommend to the City that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a Police Officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the City as a Police Officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the City will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(6)  Disability Payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
a.  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
b.  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsection (j)(1)a. or (1)b., which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(i)  Vesting. If a member terminates his employment as a Police Officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(j)  Optional Forms of Benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
a.  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
b.  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five percent (75%), sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 ?%) or fifty percent (50%) of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
c.  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (1)b. above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(3)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in subsection (k). 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
a.  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under subsection (g). 
b.  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
c.  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with subsection (k). 
d.  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f)(1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
e.  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70½) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the City. 
(6)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(k)  Beneficiaries. 
(1)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(2)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (1), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(3)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(l)  Claims Procedures. 
(1)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("Claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(2)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(m)  Reports to Division of Retirement. Each year and no later than March 15th, the board shall file an annual report with the Division of Retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 185.221. 
(n)  Roster of Retirees. The Secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this ordinance in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the Secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(o)  Maximum Pension. 
(1)  Basic Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to Basic Limitation for Form of Benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
a.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent (5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
b.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half percent (5.5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the Plan Year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
c.  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections a. and b. above. 
(3)  Benefits Not Taken into Account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under §415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
c.  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
a.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
b.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
c.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other Adjustments in Limitations. 
a.  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
b.  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the City, the adjustments provided for in a. above shall not apply. 
c.  The reductions provided for in a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to subsection (h), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to subsection (g). 
d.  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than Ten (10) Years of Participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent (10%) of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to subsection (h), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to subsection (g). 
(7)  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000) Limit; Less Than Ten Years of Service. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (o), the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (8) if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the City has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the City, the limit under this subsection (8) shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(9)  Reduction of Benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service Credit Purchase Limits. 
a.  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in subsections (z) and (aa), then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph 1., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph 2. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
1.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause b.2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(11)  Contribution Limits. 
a.  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the System, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 2½ months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
(a)  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
(b)  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under the definition, of "Salary" in subsection (a), Definitions. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph 1. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
c.  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
d.  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (11) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(12)  Additional Limitation on Pension Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
a.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
b.  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of Direct Rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(p)  Minimum Distribution of Benefits. 
(1)  General Rules. 
a.  Effective Date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
b.  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
c.  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section other than this subsection (1)c., distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(2)  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
a.  Required Beginning Date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70½) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the City. 
b.  Death of Member Before Distributions Begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (70½), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (2)b., other than subsection (2)b.1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (2)b., distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (2)b.4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)b.1., the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
c.  Death After Distributions Begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
d.  Form of Distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year. 
a.  General Requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
2.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to subsection (f), subsection (g), subsection (i), or subsection (j) (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
b.  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection (g)) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(4)  General Distribution Rules. 
a.  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
b.  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(5)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 40l(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date.

(1)  Interest of Members in System. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(4)  Use of Forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future City contributions.

(6)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "Credited Service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply.

In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)-21. 
(r)  Repeal or Termination of System. 
(1)  This ordinance establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  If this ordinance shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. chapter 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this ordinance who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting one hundred percent (100%) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(3)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
a.  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the City if additional assets are required, in which event the City shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
b.

c.  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection b. involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the Police Officer's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the Police Officer. 
d.  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection c., and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the City, less return to the State of the State's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the City and the State to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the City and the State. 
e.  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection b., the amounts determined under subsection c. 
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the City or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section. 
(r)  Domestic Relations Orders; Retiree Directed Payments; Exemption From Execution And Non-Assignability. 
(1)  Domestic Relations Orders. 
a.  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the system's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a retiree, the member or retiree shall submit the proposed order to the board for review to determine whether the system may legally honor the order. 
b.  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(2)  Retiree Directed Payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the City, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the City, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. Chapter 185, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(3)  Exemption from Execution, Non-Assignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this ordinance/resolution and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this ordinance/resolution are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

(w)  Direct Transfers of Eligible Rollover Distributions; Elimination of Mandatory Distributions. 
(1)  Rollover Distributions. 
a.  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
b.  Definitions. 
1.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
2.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.

(1)  Any retiree who is retired under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the City, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the City shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(2)  After Normal Retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(3)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the City after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, discontinue receipt of benefits during any subsequent employment period. 
(4)  After Early Retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the City in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If by virtue of that reemployment, the retiree is eligible to participate in this system, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, credited service and early retirement reduction factor as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(5)  Reemployment of Terminated Vested Persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit.

This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Fort Walton Beach Economic Development Incentive Ordinance." 
It is the intent of the City to establish and further a sound business and industrial tax base in the City of Fort Walton Beach, of which said tax base will benefit all residents in the City by better broadening the distribution of the burden of said taxes. 
This intent and purpose is accomplished by attracting those businesses and industries that pay greater than the average annual Okaloosa County wage to locate in the City. 
The Legislature of the State of Florida enacted Section 166.021(8) of the Florida Statutes to facilitate the growth and creation of business enterprises in the municipalities of the State of Florida. 
The City desires to participate in and promote economic development incentive programs that will assist in accomplishing the purposes of attracting targeted industries with value-added employment opportunities. 
It is the intent and purpose of this ordinance to provide the authority and mechanisms within the parameters of federal, state and local laws, to allow the expenditure of public funds for promotions and incentives to attract industries or businesses to locate within the City and through expansion of certain existing industries or businesses, particularly when such industries and businesses pay above average annual wage to locate or expand in the City.  
4.07.03 - Economic Development Ad Valorem Tax Exemption (EDATE). 
Subject to the provisions of this ordinance, certain new businesses or expansions of an existing business or industry due to relocation to the City or through expansion of existing facilities within the City may be granted an ad valorem property tax exemption of up to 100% of the increased value added to the tax roll for up to ten (10) years. 
To comply with statutory requirements, eligible applicants must meet the job creation threshold of 10 full-time (or full-time equivalent) jobs for a business that manufactures, processes, compounds, fabricates or produces for sale items of tangible personal property at a fixed location and which comprises an industrial or manufacturing plant; 25 full time (or full-time equivalent) jobs for other industries with a sales factor less than 0.50 for each year that the exemption is claimed; 50 full time (or full-time equivalent) jobs for an office use provided that such business or organization office first begins operation on a site clearly separate from any other commercial or industrial operation owned by the same business or organization; or any business or organization located in an enterprise zone or brownfield area that first begins operation on a site clearly separate from any other commercial or industrial operation owned by the same business or organization. 
The City Council, in its sole discretion, shall determine and set guidelines to insure continued consistency with statutory requirements and to integrate local input within the guidelines to achieve the desired results of offering this incentive. No precedent shall be implied or inferred by the granting of an exemption to a New Business or Expansion of an Existing Business.  
4.07.04 - Administration and Procedures. 
A supporting Policy & Procedures Manual to implement the exemptions and incentives provided for in this ordinance shall be developed upon adoption of this ordinance.  
4.07.05 - Performance Demonstration and Review. 
Following adoption of an ordinance granting an Economic Development Ad Valorem Tax Exemption or following execution of a grant of exemption agreement as required by this ordinance, the City may periodically conduct site visits and audits of the New Business or Expansion of an Existing Business to ensure that the business is satisfactorily performing under the ordinance or grant of exemption agreement and this ordinance. As a prerequisite of receiving an exemption or incentive from the City in year one and each year thereafter, the New Business or Expansion of an Existing Business shall demonstrate: 
(a)  That it has fully satisfied all terms and conditions contained in the agreement as described in this ordinance continuing through the subject funding period; 
(b)  That it has not been, nor is, in breach or default of the grant of exemption agreement or any other incentive agreement with the City pursuant to this ordinance; and,

(2)  For any existing building or facility, the New Business or Expansion of an Existing Business shall demonstrate that it has created the number of eligible new jobs promised no later than twelve (12) months from moving into its building or facility and commencing operations, or from the date of completing its multi-year expansion.  
4.07.06 - Cessation of Operations During Exemption Term. 
In the event the New Business or Expansion of an Existing Business ceases its operations, closes its business, moves out of the City, loses its status as a New Business or Expansion of an Existing Business at any time during the ordinance or agreement period, or is in breach or default of any ordinance or grant of exemption agreement with the City under this ordinance, then the New Business or Expansion of an Existing Business shall forfeit any and all funding/incentives which may be remaining under its agreement and any other incentive pursuant to this ordinance.  
4.07.07 - Incentives Non-Exclusive. 
The incentive in this ordinance is not exclusive and eligible businesses or industries may apply for as many incentives as they qualify for under other resolutions, ordinances or provisions of the Code. Further, the incentive in this ordinance does not preclude an industry or business from applying or qualifying in other federal, state or local programs. City Council, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit or restrict the number of applicants and the total number and dollar amount of all grants of exemption, deferrals and incentives under this ordinance which may be awarded in any given City fiscal year.

(a)  General authority. 
(1)  The City Council is hereby authorized to impose a fire services assessment to fund all or any portion of the fire services cost for assessed property upon benefited nongovernment property at a rate of assessment based on the benefit accruing to such property from the City's provision of fire services, facilities, or programs. 
(2)  All fire services assessments shall be imposed each fiscal year in a subsequently adopted fire services fee rate resolution. Such fire services fee rate resolution shall determine the amount of the fire services assessment against assessed property pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a classification of property designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of fire services cost for assessed property among properties on a basis reasonably related to the benefit provided by fire services, facilities, or programs funded with assessment proceeds. 
(3)  The fire services fee rate resolution shall also establish the method by which the fire services fee will be calculated for non-profit and government properties. Nothing contained in this ordinance shall be construed to require the imposition of assessments against government property.

(2)  So long as the development and articulation of any method of apportionment, rates of assessment, the assessment roll or methods of notice have been reasonably undertaken and otherwise promulgated to the public in accordance with the time periods and provisions hereof, the fire services fee rate resolution may be adopted at the same meeting of the City Council, or at any subsequent meeting of the City Council, immediately after adoption of this ordinance, or any amendment hereto. 
(c)  Assessment Roll. 
(1)  The City Manager shall prepare, or direct the preparation of, the fire services assessment roll, which shall contain the following: 
a.  A summary description of all assessed property by tax parcel conforming to the description contained on the tax roll. 
b.  The name of the owner of the assessed property. 
(2)  The extension or application of the rates of the proposed assessment to be imposed against each such tax parcel of assessed property. 
(3)  The assessment roll shall be retained by the City Manager and shall be open to public inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the assessment roll be in printed form if the amount of the assessment for each tax parcel of property can be determined by use of the internet, a computer terminal available to the public or similar technology available to the public. 
(d)  Notice by Publication. At least twenty (20) days prior to the public hearing for the fire services fee rate resolution, the City shall notice the public hearing by publication in a newspaper generally circulated within the boundaries of the City. The notice shall provide:

At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the City Council, the City Council shall receive any written comments or objections of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the City Council, adopt the fire services assessment rate resolution which shall (A) establish the rate or rates of assessment to be imposed in the designated fiscal year; (B) approve and adopt the assessment roll, with such amendments and directions as it deems just and right; and (C) provide direction as to the method of collection. All parcels assessed shall derive a special benefit from the fire protection services, facilities, or programs to be provided or constructed and the assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned between the properties that receive the special benefit. All objections to the annual assessment resolution shall be made in writing and filed with the City Manager at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The annual fire services assessment resolution as confirmed shall constitute the final action necessary annually to impose or re-impose assessments hereunder. 
(f)  Effect of Annual Assessment Resolution. The fire services assessments for the initial fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year shall be established upon adoption and confirmation of the annual fire services assessment rate resolution. The adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate or rates of assessment, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the City Council action adopting and confirming on the annual assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be delivered for collection using the traditional direct billing method of collection described in Section 4.08.030(a) hereof to collect the assessments, or such other method as the City Council by resolution shall designate. 
(g)  Adoption of Subsequent Annual Assessment Resolutions. The City Council may adopt subsequent annual assessment resolutions as a part of and during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which an assessment is imposed hereunder. The annual fire services assessment resolution shall approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year. The assessment roll may be prepared in accordance with the methods of apportionment set forth in the prior assessment resolution but may include modifications as a matter of policy as to what, if any, portion or portions of the City's budget is paid for from legally available funds other than assessment revenues. Failure to adopt an annual assessment resolution during the budget adoption process may be cured at any time. 
(h)  Lien of Fire Service Assessments. Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, until paid such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims. The lien for an assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the City Council of the annual assessment resolution. The lien for an assessment collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Method shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for an assessment collected under the traditional method of collection provided in Section 4.08.030(a) hereof shall be deemed perfected upon adoption and confirmation by the City Council of the annual assessment resolution, after a public hearing, and shall attach to the property on such date of each such annual assessment resolution. 
(i)  Revisions to Fire Services Cost Assessments. If any fire services assessment made under the provisions of this ordinance is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the City Council is satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the City Council has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the City Council may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any property benefited by the fire service assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this ordinance and in case such second assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the City Council may obtain and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
(j)  Procedural Irregularities. Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under the provisions of this ordinance shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this ordinance; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any party objecting to an assessment imposed pursuant to this ordinance must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(k)  Correction of Errors and Omissions. 
(1)  No act of error or omission on the part of the Property Appraiser, Tax Collector, City Manager, City Council, or their agents, employees, or deputies shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the City Council under the provision of this ordinance. 
(2)  When it shall appear that any assessment should have been imposed under this ordinance against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire protection services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll, the City Council may, upon provision of notice to the owner by first class mail, impose the applicable assessment for the fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years. 
(3)  Such total assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the expiration of sixty (60) days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The assessment so imposed shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and may be collected as provided in Section 4.08.030 hereof. 
(4)  The City Manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to an assessment, based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, to correct any error in annually applying the assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of mailed notice pursuant to this ordinance or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Additionally, because the size and nature of the tax roll may yield anomalies, the City Manager is authorized to apply sound public administration judgment and delete or remove individual tax parcels from the assessment roll that due to specific circumstances do not receive a special benefit, are not developable (e.g. subsurface rights, submerged, slivers, right-of-way, common elements) or are reasonably determined to be inappropriate, infeasible or impracticable to assess, and do not merit the expenditure of public funds and resources to impose or collect such assessments. Any such corrections shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this ordinance. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the City Manager and not the Property Appraiser or Tax Collector. 
(5)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the Tax Collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the City Manager. 
(l)  Interim Assessments. 
(1)  An interim fire services assessment may be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after adoption and confirmation of the fire services fee rate resolution. The amount of the interim assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the fire services fee rate resolution for the fiscal year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim assessment shall also include an estimate of the subsequent year's assessment. If the Council determines to impose an interim assessment, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the interim assessment is received by the City. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the interim assessment, shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(2)  Exclusive of property for which an interim assessment was paid pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, an interim assessment may also be imposed against any property which for any reason was omitted from the fire service assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual tax parcel as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual assessment resolution for any upcoming fiscal year. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed due and payable and shall constitute a lien against such property for which it is imposed. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(m)  Administrative Hardship Deferment. 
(1)  Annually upon application of the owner of a tax parcel subject to the assessments contemplated herein, the City Manager may grant a hardship deferment, in which case the tax parcel in question will receive a deferral. The owner shall be required to execute a binding agreement encumbering the tax parcel and otherwise assure the City that payment in full of the assessment and any recording cost, plus interest at an estimated cost of City funds compounded annually, shall be due over a period of time or upon sale or transfer of the property. Such agreement or a memorandum thereof shall be recorded in the Official Records of Okaloosa County, Florida. Dependent upon the volume or demand for such deferment, the City Council may determine to release such deferments in the future. However, all funding for such hardship deferment, or the consequences of the deferment or any future release, shall be from legally available funds other than direct proceeds of other assessments. The Assessment Coordinator is authorized to use sound public administration judgment in applying this authority and considering such applications. 
(2)  This provision serves to promote a public purpose and the general welfare, morals and contentment of the inhabitants and residents of the City. 
(Ord. No. 2017 , § Art. II(517), 9-10-19)  
4.08.030 - Collection of Fire Service Assessments. 
(a)  Collection. Unless otherwise directed by the City Council, the assessment shall be collected pursuant to the utility billing method provided in subsection (b) hereof. Any hearing or notice required by this ordinance may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by this ordinance or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(b)  Collection of Fire Services Charges on the Utility Bill. 
(1)  The fire services charge may be billed to and collected on a monthly basis along with the City's Utility in the regular utility billing cycle, appearing as a separate line item. 
(2)  The utility customer of record and the owner of such property subject to a fire services charge are responsible for payment of the fire services charge as the charge is either a fire services fee on non-profit or government property which is in exchange for services and facilities furnished to such property to manage and control the fire services burden generated by the use and development of such property, or alternatively, the charge is a fire services assessment on nongovernment property for which the property receives a benefit from the provision of fire services, facilities and programs by the City. 
(3)  Bills for the fire services charge shall be payable at the same time, in the same manner, and subject to the same penalties as have been heretofore established for other utility fees charged and administered by the City. The owner and utility customer of record shall be notified of any deficiency in the payment of the fire services charge in the same manner as other delinquent utility bills. The failure to pay such a fire services charge shall subject the property to the discontinuance of other utility services and all other penalties and charges available under law relative to the discontinuance of such utility services. The administrative appeal and hearing procedure applicable to the discontinuance of other utility services in the City shall be applicable to the discontinuance of such services for any delinquencies resulting under this article. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the City may make alternative collection arrangements with property owners or tenants or both for the payment of the fire services charge. 
(c)  Alternative Method of Collection of Fire Assessments. In lieu of utilizing the utility bill, the City Council may elect to collect fire services assessments by the uniform assessment collection act or any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this section. 
(1)  The City shall provide fire assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
a.  A brief explanation of the fire services assessment; 
b.  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire services assessment; 
c.  The number of units contained within the parcel; 
d.  The total amount of the fire services assessment imposed against the parcel for the appropriate period; 
e.  The location at which payment will be accepted; 
f.  The date on which the fire services assessment is due; and 
g.  A statement that the fire services assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the fire services assessment shall be recorded in the official records of Okaloosa County. Nothing in this article shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The City shall have the right to collect all delinquent fire services assessments in the manner provided for the delinquent utility bills or in any manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. 
(4)  A fire services assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within sixty (60) days from the date any installment is due. The City or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of the fire services assessment within ninety (90) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the City or its agent will either: 
a.  Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent fire services assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or 
b.  Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire services assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(5)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described in this article shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the City may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The City or its agent may join in one (1) foreclosure action for the collection of fire services assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions of this article. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire services assessments and any other costs incurred by the City as a result of such delinquent fire services assessments and the costs shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(6)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent fire services assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that (i) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article, and (ii) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent fire services assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the City's use of an alternative method of collection, the City Manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to them or other City officials in Section 4.08.020(k). 
(8)  Any City Council action required in the collection of fire services assessments may be by resolution. 
(d)  Fire Services Fee on Non-Profits and Government Property. Legislative declarations as to fire services fee on government property. It is hereby ascertained and declared that the fire services fee as authorized in this article is reasonably related to the cost of providing fire services, facilities and programs to non-profits and government property. The fire services fee is not a special assessment; it is a fee for services available and rendered to property owned and operated by non-profit and government owners. 
(e)  Fire Services Assessments on Nongovernment Property. Legislative declarations as to the existence of special benefit. It is further hereby ascertained and declared that the fire services, facilities, and programs provide a special benefit to nongovernment property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building based upon the following legislative determinations: 
(1)  Fire services possess a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of improved property by: 
a.  Protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the provision of available fire services; 
b.  Protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of improvements and structures within improved parcels; 
c.  Lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and comprehensive fire services program within the City; and 
d.  Containing the spread of fire incidents occurring on vacant property with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of improved property. 
(2)  The fire services of the City under its existing fire services program enhances and strengthens the relationship of such services to the use and enjoyment of buildings within improved parcels of property within the areas served by the City. 
(3)  Within the areas served by the City, the fire services of the City under its existing fire services program enhance the value of business and commercial property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building, which enhanced value can be anticipated to be reflected in the rental charge or value of such business or commercial property. 
(Ord. No. 2017 , § Art. III(1820), 9-10-19)  
4.08.040 - General Provisions. 
(a)  Applicability. This ordinance and the City's authority to impose assessments pursuant hereto shall be applicable throughout the City. 
(b)  Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are severable; and if any section, subsection, sentence, clause or provision is held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby. 
(c)  Alternative Method. This ordinance shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized hereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing or which may hereafter come into existence. This ordinance, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of the City, shall be liberally construed to affect the purposes hereof. 
(d)  Effective Date. This ordinance shall be in force and take effect immediately upon adoption by the City Council on second reading and signature by the Mayor.

5.03.02 - Penalty. 
Unless stated otherwise, violations of this chapter are punishable as provided in chapter 1.05.

Prosecution for a violation of any of the provisions of this division shall be initiated by the enforcement agency officer who witnesses such offense or has sufficient probable cause to believe that such offense has been committed, or who discovers an article of litter bearing the name or address of a person on the property of another or on any public property. It shall be presumed that any article of litter so discovered is the property of such person whose name or address appears thereon and that such person placed or caused to be placed such article of litter on the property of another or public property. This presumption is based on the tenet that all generators of such litter are responsible for such litter until such time as it has been properly disposed of.  
5.03.05 - Corrective Notice Alternative. 
In lieu of arrest, a corrective written notice may be issued to a violator of any of the provisions of this division to correct the offense.

All such notices issued shall be maintained by the issuing authority for public inspection during normal office hours. Notices mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the violator's last known place of residence, shall be deemed personal service upon the person for the purposes of this division.  
5.03.06 - Remedy for Noncompliance with Corrective Notice. 
If a person served with a written corrective notice fails to comply with the notice within the period stipulated, and in those cases in which no notice can be served because the location of the owner or agent of the property in question is unknown, the council may cause the property to be cleaned up and the nuisance abated. The cost for such cleanup shall be billed and mailed via certified mail to the last known address of such owner or agent. If such bill is not paid within thirty (30) days from the mailing date, or if, because the location of the owner or agent is unknown and no bill can be sent, the council shall execute a lien on the property for the amount expended on the cleanup until the bill is satisfied.

(e)  Every person in possession, in charge of or in control of any place, public or private, where litter is accumulated or generated, shall have available, and at all times shall keep such litter in, adequate and suitable receptacles and/or containers capable of holding such materials until proper final disposal is accomplished. 
(f)  No person shall keep any unauthorized accumulation of litter on any property, vacant or occupied, any premises, a public street, alley or other public place or a private place.  
5.03.10 - Construction Debris Control, Removal. 
All construction and demolition contractors, owners and agents shall provide onsite control measures for the storage of loose debris, paper, tar paper, packaging and crating materials and other litter to prevent wind-driven scattering of such materials if the materials are otherwise not properly disposed of on a daily basis. All litter tarpaper, packaging and crating materials and similar materials shall be removed within thirty (30) days after the completion of the construction or demolition.  
5.03.11 - Responsibility for Surrounding Areas. 
Each operator, owner, lessee or agent of any business, industry or institution, private or public, profit or nonprofit, shall keep the adjacent and surrounding areas clean of wind-driven litter generated from such business, industry or institution.

5.03.12 - Unauthorized Disposal. 
No private property owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or agent shall grant permission to any person to dispose of litter on the property in any manner other than in permitted disposal sites.

The registrant shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice within which to address or eliminate the reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the City Manager, to accomplish the same. If the plan is rejected, the City Manager shall provide written notice of such rejection to the registrant and shall make a recommendation to the City Council regarding a decision as to termination of registration. A decision by the City to terminate a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the City Council. A registrant shall be notified by written notice of any decision by the City Council to terminate its registration. Such written notice shall be sent within seven (7) days after the decision.  
10.20.39 - Actions Upon Termination Required. 
In the event of termination, the former registrant shall notify the City of the assumption or anticipated assumption by another registrant of ownership of the registrant's Communications Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way; or provide the City with an acceptable plan for disposition of its Communications Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way. The registrant shall be responsible for any damage in the Rights-of-Way prior to termination. If a registrant fails to comply with this subsection, which determination of noncompliance is subject to appeal, the City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limited to taking possession of the facilities where another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the facilities or requiring the registrant within ninety (90) days of the termination, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the registrant, to remove some or all of the facilities from the Public Rights-of-Way and restore the Public Rights-of-Way to its original condition before the removal. 
In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every portion of the Communications Facilities remaining in the Public Rights-of-Way of the City.  
10.20.40 - Removal Limited to Terminated Registrant. 
In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not authorize the City to cause the removal of Communications Facilities used to provide another service for which the registrant or another person who owns or exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or license with the governing Federal or State agency, if required for provision of such service, and is registered with the City, if required.  
10.20.41 - Existing Facilities. 
A Communications Services Provider with an existing Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way of the City has sixty (60) days from the effective date of this Chapter [November 27, 2001] to comply with the terms of this Chapter, including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation thereof.  
10.20.42 - Insurance Required. 
A registrant shall provide, pay for and maintain satisfactory to the City the types of insurance described herein. All insurance shall be from responsible companies duly authorized to do business in the State and having a rating reasonably acceptable to the City.

This provision includes, but is not limited to, the City's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings. The City agrees to notify the registrant, in writing, within a reasonable time of the City receiving notice, of any issue it determines may require indemnification. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the City from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and at its own cost if in the City's reasonable belief there exists or may exist a conflict, potential conflict or appearance of a conflict. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted: (a) as denying to either party any remedy or defense available to such party under the laws of the State of Florida; or (b) as a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver provided in § 768.28, F.S., as it may be amended. The indemnification requirements shall survive and be in effect after the termination or cancellation of a registration.  
10.20.44 - Construction Bond. 
Prior to issuing a permit where the work under the permit will require restoration of Public Rights-of-Way, the City may require a construction bond to secure the restoration of the Public Rights-of-Way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a construction bond hereunder may only be required to the extent that the cost of the restoration exceeds the amount recoverable against the security fund. 
Twelve (12) months after the completion of the restoration in Public Rights-of-Way in accordance with the bond, the registrant may eliminate the bond. However, the City may subsequently require a new bond for any subsequent work in the Public Rights-of-Way. The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a rating reasonably acceptable to the City; shall be subject to the approval of the City Manager; and shall provide that: "For twelve (12) months after issuance of this bond, this bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty (60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew."  
10.20.45 - Reservation of Rights. 
The rights reserved by the City with respect to any construction bond established pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the City may have under this section or at law or equity. The rights reserved to the City under this section are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved in this Chapter, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the construction bond will affect any other right the City may have.  
10.20.46 - Security Fund. 
At or prior to the time a registrant receives its first permit to place or maintain a Communications Facility in Public Rights-of-Way after the effective date of this Chapter, the registrant may be required to file with the City, for City approval, an annual bond, cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit in the sum of $25,000.00 or other appropriate amount as determined by the City having as a surety a company qualified to do business in the State of Florida, and acceptable to the City Manager, which shall be referred to as the "security fund." The security fund shall be maintained from such time through the earlier of: (a) transfer, sale, assignment or removal of all Communications Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way; or (b) twelve 12 months after the termination or cancellation of any registration. The security fund shall be conditioned on the full and faithful performance by the registrant of all requirements, duties and obligations imposed upon registrant by the provisions of this Chapter. 
The security fund shall be furnished annually or as frequently as necessary to provide a continuing guarantee of the registrant's full and faithful performance at all times. In the event a registrant fails to perform its duties and obligations imposed upon the registrant by the provisions of this Chapter, subject to section 10.26.06 of this Chapter, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the security fund, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal, relocation or abandonment of any facilities of the registrant in Public Rights-of-Way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys fees, up to the full amount of the security fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may in its discretion not require a Security Fund or may accept a corporate guarantee of the registrant or its parent company.  
10.20.47 - Enforcement Remedies. 
A registrant's failure to comply with provisions of this Chapter shall constitute a violation of this Chapter and shall subject the registrant to the code enforcement. In addition, at the City's discretion, violation of this Chapter may be punishable as provided in section 1.05, of this Code. 
Failure of the City to enforce any requirements of this Chapter shall not constitute a waiver of the City's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies.  
10.20.48 - Abandonment of Facility. 
10.20.481  Notice of Abandonment: Upon abandonment of a Communications Facility owned by a registrant in Public Rights-of-Way, the registrant shall notify the City within ninety (90) days. The City may direct the registrant by written notice to remove all or any portion of such abandoned facility at the registrant's sole expense if the City determines that the abandoned facility's presence interferes with the public health, safety or welfare, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, a determination that such facility: 
(1)  Compromises safety at any time for any Public Rights-of-Way user or during construction or maintenance in Public Rights-of-Way. 
(2)  Prevents another person from locating facilities in the area of Public Rights-of-Way where the abandoned facility is located when other alternative locations are not reasonably available. The City may require the third person to coordinate with the registrant that owns the existing facility for joint removal and placement, where agreed to by the registrant. 
(3)  Creates a maintenance condition that is disruptive to the Public Rights-of-Way's use. 
10.20.482  Consent to Removal: In the event that the City does not direct the removal of the abandoned facility, the registrant, by its notice of abandonment to the City, shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by the City or another person at such third party's cost. If the registrant fails to remove all or any portion of an abandoned facility as directed by the City within a reasonable time period as may be required by the City under the circumstances, the City may perform such removal and charge the cost of the removal against the registrant.  
10.20.49 - Force Majeure. 
In the event a registrant's performance of or compliance with any of the provisions of this Chapter is prevented by a cause or event not within the registrant's control, such inability to perform or comply shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result, provided, however, that such registrant uses all practicable means to expeditiously cure or correct any such inability to perform or comply. For purposes of this Chapter, causes or events not within a registrant's control shall include, without limitation, acts of God, floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, fires and other natural disasters, acts of public enemies, riots or civil disturbances, sabotage, strikes and restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court. Causes or events within registrant's control, and thus not falling within this section, shall include, without limitation, registrant's financial inability to perform or comply, economic hardship, and misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by any of registrant's directors, officers, employees, contractors or agents.  
10.20.50 - Reservation of Rights and Remedies. 
The City reserves the right to amend this Chapter as it shall find necessary in the lawful exercise of its police powers. This Chapter shall be applicable to all Communications Facilities placed in the Public Rights-of-Way on or after the effective date of this Chapter and shall apply to all existing Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way prior to the effective date of this Chapter [November 27, 2001], to the full extent permitted by State and Federal law. The adoption of this Chapter is not intended to affect any rights or defenses of the City or a communications service provider under any existing franchise, license or other agreements with a communications services provider. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the remedies the City or the registrant has available under applicable law. Any person who uses the communications facilities of a registrant, other than the registrant that owns the facilities, shall not be entitled to any rights to place or maintain such facilities in excess of the rights of the registrant that places or maintains the facilities.  
10.30 - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL 
 
10.30.01 - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this Chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Air gap separation. An unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device, and the flood rim of the receptacle, and shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case shall the gap be less than one inch. This gap shall also be above the established 100-year flood level. 
ASSE. American Society of Sanitary Engineering. 
Atmospheric vacuum breaker. A backflow prevention device which is operated by atmospheric pressure in combination with the force of gravity. The unit is designed to work in a vertical plane only. The moving part consists of a poppet valve, which must be carefully sized to slide in a guided chamber and effectively shut off the reverse flow of water when a negative pressure exists. 
Auxiliary water supply. Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary water supplies may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well, spring, river, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted or contaminated or may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
AWWA. American Water Works Association. 
Backflow. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable supply of water from any source other than its intended source. 
Backflow prevention deviceApproved. A device to counteract back pressure or prevent back siphonage. "Approved" are devices that have met the requirements of one or more of the following standards and that have therefore been approved by the utilities director: 
(1)  AWWA  C506. Standard for Backflow Prevention Devices, Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Types 
(2)  ASSE  1001. Atmospheric Type Vacuum Breaker 
(3)  ASSE  1011. Hose Connection Vacuum Breakers 
(4)  ASSE  1020. Pressure Type Vacuum Breakers 
(5)  ASSE  1024. Dual Check Type Backflow Preventer 
(6)  ASSE  1013. Reduced Pressure Principle Back Pressure Backflow Preventers 
(7)  ASSE  1015. Double Check Valve Type Back Pressure Backflow Preventers 
(8)  Manual of Cross-Connection Control. By Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research University of Southern California. 
Back pressure. Backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler or other means that could create pressure greater than the supply pressure. 
Back siphonage. Backflow due to a negative or sub-atmospheric pressure within a water system. 
Containment. A method of controlling potential and/or confirmed cross connections by installation of a double check assembly or a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
Cross connection. Any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply system is connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture or other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, sewage or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality, which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply system as a result of backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over devices or any other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow could occur are considered to be cross connections. 
Double check valve assembly. An assembly composed of two single, independently acting check valves, including rightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the water tightness of each check valve. 
Health hazard. Any condition, devices or particles in any water supply system or in its operation which create or may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. 
Isolation. A method of controlling potential and/or confirmed cross connections by installation of an air gap separation or a vacuum breaker. 
Pressure vacuum breaker. Similar to an atmospheric vacuum breaker except that the checking unit "poppet valve" is activated by a spring. This type of vacuum breaker does not require a negative pressure to react and can be used on the pressure side of a valve. 
Public water supply. Any system or water supply intended or used for human consumption or other domestic use, including source, treatment, storage and distribution where water is furnished to any community, collection or number of individuals, or is made available to the public for human consumption or domestic use, but excluding supplies serving one single-family residence. 
Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. A device incorporating two or more check valves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two check valves or two shutoff valves and equipped with necessary appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at less than the pressure of the public water supply side of the device even at cessation of normal flow. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby providing an air gap in the device. This air gap shall also be above the 100-year flood level.  
10.30.02 - Intent and Purpose. 
The City, in its operation of a public potable water supply system, is required to ensure protection of public health through the provision of minimum requirements and standards for design, construction, operation and maintenance of its system. It is essential that physical cross connections, which create or have the potential to create an imminent and substantial danger to public health, be eliminated from the distribution system and plumbing systems of customers. Backflow can result in the potable water system becoming a transmitter of disease, toxic materials and other hazardous liquids. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and maintain a cross connection control program to protect the supply of water and the health of water consumers by the control of actual and/or potential cross connections through methods of containment and/or isolation.  
10.30.03 - Authority; Conflicts. 
Authority for implementing a cross connection control program is given by the Florida Safe Drinking Water Act [§ 403.850 et seq., F.S.] and the Florida Administrative Code, Chapter 17-22.107, section 4(b). In case of a conflict between any of the provisions of this Chapter and State law or regulation, the more restrictive requirement shall prevail.  
10.30.04 - City Responsibilities. 
The City is responsible for the protection of its public potable water distribution system from backflow of contaminants or pollutants through any water service connection. If, in the judgment of the City, an approved backflow prevention device is required in the water service connection to any of its customer's premises for the safety of the users of the water system, the City shall give notice in writing to the customer that an approved backflow prevention device shall be installed at the customer's expense. 
Compliance testing after initial installation of a backflow prevention device shall be performed by the City.  
10.30.05 - Consumer Responsibilities. 
Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to meet the City's time schedule for installation of such device shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of water service until such device have been properly installed. Any licensed plumber licensed to do business in the City may install the proper device in the correct manner. A permit for such installation is required. 
In the event of any known or suspected accidental pollution or contamination of the City's potable water system, the consumer shall promptly take steps to confine any further spread of pollution or contamination and shall immediately notify the City of the situation. The consumer shall be responsible for each incident and bear any cost incurred by the City relating to the incident.  
10.30.06 - Requirements for Installation. 
(1)  All backflow prevention devices shall be installed at a location designated by the City. Generally, this will be immediately on the customer's side of the meter. If circumstances make this location impractical, then the backflow prevention device may be placed further downstream from the meter. However, any piping between the meter and the backflow prevention device must be either exposed or readily accessible for inspection. 
(2)  All premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not as an additional source of water to the City system shall have an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device installed in order to protect the public water supply against backflow. 
(3)  For all premises where there is water or substances that could be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation, an approved double check valve assembly, or an approved vacuum breaker. 
(4)  For all premises where there is any material dangerous to health, which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. Examples of premises where these conditions have been found to exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants. 
(5)  For all premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved double check valve or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
(6)  For all premises where security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions make it impossible or impractical to perform a complete in plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected with an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
(7)  For all premises more than two stories high (excluding basements), the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.  
10.30.07 - Facility-Device Requirements.

10.30.08 - Inspection, Service. 
The City Utilities Director, Water Supervisor or designated representative shall conduct inspections of customers' premises where suspected cross connections or potential cross connections may exist. Should any cross connections or potential cross connections be detected, the customer shall be notified in writing of the appropriate type of backflow prevention device to be installed. Refusal by a customer to allow an inspection shall be considered prima facie evidence of the existence of cross connections, thereby requiring the installation of an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device or the disconnection of service. 
10.30.081  Existing Facilities: For existing facilities, customers will be asked to complete a questionnaire on their water usage in order to make a preliminary determination of the potential health hazard to the City's water distribution system. When such information or other knowledge indicates a potential health hazard, a survey of the customers' water system shall be conducted. Such surveys need not be a detailed inspection of the location or disposition of water lines, but can be confined to establishing the water use on the premises; the existence of any cross connections; the availability of auxiliary water supplies; the use or availability of pollutants, contaminants and other liquid, solid or gaseous substances that may be used industrially for stabilization of water supplies; and other procedures for determining the degree of health hazard. 
10.30.082  New Services: All new services shall be classified at the time of application to indicate the degree of hazard anticipated and, hence, the type of device required. This information shall be given to the applicant in writing. Any later change in water usage may require a change in the type of device. 
10.30.083  Changes in Water Use: All water customers of the City shall be required to notify the City, in writing, of any changes in their water usage. These changes will be evaluated to determine if there is an increase in the potential health hazard and if such increase requires the installation of a device. If a device is already in place, it will be determined if this device is adequate or if a different type of device is required.  
10.30.09 - Records. 
Appropriate records shall be maintained by the City of all potential and confirmed cross connections. Installations and tests of backflow prevention devices shall be recorded and filed for future reference.  
10.30.10 - Testing, Maintenance of Devices. 
Routine testing of backflow prevention devices shall be performed by the City. The frequency of testing will be dependent upon the type of device installed and the potential health hazard involved. 
Customers will be notified in advance of the date and approximate time that any testing will be performed. It will be necessary to shut off the water service for an approximate period not exceeding fifteen (15) minutes, and every effort will be made to schedule tests to suit the customers' convenience. If the customers' operations cannot permit an interruption of service, it will be the customers' responsibility to have two approved backflow prevention devices installed in parallel so that one may be used while the other is being tested. Bypasses around backflow prevention devices are expressly prohibited. 
If any devices tested are found to be faulty, the customer will immediately be notified and will be required to have the device promptly repaired or replaced at his or her expense. The customer shall be required to notify the Utilities Director of the progress of the repair or replacement every fifth (5 th ) work day from receipt of the notice of the failure of the device. In high hazard situations, it may be necessary to terminate service until a properly operating device is in place. The customer should notify the City as soon as any faulty device has been corrected so that it may be retested.

The City has the authority to grant a revocable and non-exclusive franchise to construct and operate a cable communications system in, under, over, along, across or upon the streets and public grounds within the City of Fort Walton Beach for the purpose of reception, transmission, collection, amplification, origination, distribution, or redistribution of audio, video, data, or other signals and for the development of broadband telecommunication services in accordance with the laws of the City of Fort Walton Beach, the State of Florida, and United States of America. In exercising rights pursuant hereto, grantee shall not endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, interfere with any installations of the City, any public utility serving the City or any other person permitted to use the streets and public grounds nor unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets and public grounds. The grant of one franchise does not establish priority for use over the other present or future permit or franchise holders or the City's own use of the streets and public grounds. The City shall at all times control the distribution of space in, over, under or across all streets or public grounds occupied by the cable communications system. All rights granted for the construction and operation of the cable communications system shall be subject to the continuing right of the City to require such reconstruction, relocation, change or discontinuance, of the appliances used by the cable communications system in the streets, alleys, avenues, and highways of the City, as shall in the opinion of the City be necessary in the public interest.  
10.41.02 - Non-exclusive Grants. 
No grant of any franchise shall affect the right of the City to grant to any other person a right to occupy or use the streets, or portions thereof, for the construction and operation of a cable communications system within the City or the right of the City to permit the use of the streets or public grounds of the City for any purpose whatever. By accepting a franchise, the franchisee thereby acknowledges the City's right to make such grants and permit such uses. No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed on grantee by the grant of a franchise.  
10.41.03 - Conflict. 
In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the franchise, the franchise shall control.  
10.41.04 - Subject to General Code Provisions. 
Any franchise granted by the City is hereby made subject to the general City code provisions now in effect and hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the City regarding permits, taxes, fees to be paid, or manner of construction.  
10.41.05 - Use of Public Streets and Ways. 
For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications system in the City, the grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the public streets and ways within the City such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary to the operation of the cable communications system, provided, however, that grantee complies with all design, construction, safety, and performance provisions contained in this Chapter, the franchise, and other applicable laws. The grantee shall also obtain pole attachment agreements for use of any utility poles or other utility facilities required in connection with the provision of services.  
10.41.06 - Use of Grantee Facilities. 
No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the City with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall be vested right; and such poles shall be removed, relocated or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the City determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. Grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The City shall have the right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee.  
10.41.07 - Term of Franchise. 
The term of the franchise shall commence upon execution of the franchise by the City and the grantee and shall continue for a period specified in the franchise, unless sooner terminated as provided herein. Grantee shall have no property right upon the expiration of the franchise term.  
10.41.08 - Franchise Required. 
No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets of the City or be allowed to operate within the City without a franchise.  
10.41.09 - Police, Regulatory Powers Reserved. 
Grantee shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations enacted by the City pursuant to any such power. Any conflict between the terms of this Chapter or the franchise and any present or future lawful exercise of the City's police and regulatory powers shall be resolved in favor of the franchise.  
10.41.10 - Right of Condemnation Reserved. 
Nothing in this Chapter or the franchise shall limit any right the City may have to acquire by eminent domain or otherwise any property of grantee, provided, however, that any such acquisition shall be for a price that values grantee's property at fair market value, exclusive of the value of the grant of the franchise.  
10.41.11 - City's Right to Perform Public Works. 
Nothing in this Chapter shall be a hindrance to the right of the City or any governmental authority to perform or carry on, directly or indirectly, any public works or public improvements of any description. Should the cable communications system in any way interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair of such public works or public improvements, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect or relocate its cable communications system, or part thereof, as reasonably directed by the City officials or any governmental authority.  
10.41.12 - Emergency Removal of Plant. 
If at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the City, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the City to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances or appurtenances of the cable communications system, the City shall have the right to do so at the sole cost and expense of grantee. The grantee shall bear all costs of reinstallation, repair, and other costs resulting from or arising out of the emergency cutting or removal of the cable communications system. The Grantor will make reasonable efforts to contact grantee prior to cutting or moving any of the grantee's facilities.  
10.41.13 - Removal and Relocation. 
The City shall have the power at any time to order and require grantee to remove or relocate any pole, wire, cable, or other structure that is dangerous to life or property. Restoration shall be made to original condition. In the event that grantee, after notice, fails or refuses to act within a reasonable time, the City shall have power to remove or relocate the same at the sole cost and expense of grantee.  
10.41.14 - Removal or Abandonment. 
Upon termination of the franchise by passage of time or otherwise, the grantee shall retain ownership of the cable communication system, except as otherwise provided herein or in grantee's franchise, but shall have no right to the use of Public Rights of Way. In such event and unless grantee transfers the cable communications system to a subsequent grantee approved by the City, grantee shall remove its supporting structures, poles, transmission and distribution systems, and all other appurtenances from the streets and Public Rights of Way and shall restore any property, public or private, to their original condition prior to the installation, erection, or construction of the cable communications system. Restoration of City property, including, but not limited to, the public rights-of-way, shall be in accordance with the directions and specifications of all affected departments and agencies of the City, and all applicable law. The grantee, at the option and direction of the City, shall accomplish such restoration at its expense. Such removal shall be made with the supervision of the City. If such removal and restoration is not completed within twelve (12) months after the notice by the City delivered in writing to grantee all of the grantee's property remaining in the affected public rights-of-way shall, at the option of the City, be deemed abandoned and shall, at the option of the City, become the property of the City. In the event the grantee fails or refuses to remove its system or satisfactorily restore all areas to the condition in which they existed prior to the original construction of the system, the City, at its option, may perform such work and collect the cost thereof from the grantee. No surety on any bond shall be discharged until the City has certified to the grantee in writing that the system has been dismantled, removed, and all other property restored to the satisfaction of the City.  
10.41.15 - Limitation on Use of Financial Commitments. 
Any financial commitments obtained by the grantee which have been confirmed to the City pursuant to a franchise for use in connection with the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable communications system or the grantee's performance of the terms, obligations, and conditions of this Chapter and the franchise shall be used only for such purposes.  
10.41.16 - Transfer of Ownership or Control. 
(1)  Transfer of franchise. No franchise granted hereunder, nor any interest therein, shall be transferred without the prior consent of the City, and then only under such conditions as the City may reasonably establish, however, consent may not be unreasonably withheld. 
(2)  Notice. The grantee shall promptly notify the City of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, ownership or control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of ownership or control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, or any owner(s) thereof, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of twenty-five (25) percent or more at one time of the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or fifty (50) percent cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting in concert. 
(3)  Conditions. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the City shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the City may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the grantee shall provide the City with all required information. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the City as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(4)  Assumption of control. The City agrees that any financial institution or private entities having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that it will take control and operate the cable television system. If the financial institution takes possession of the cable communications system the City shall take no action to effect a termination of the franchise without first giving to the lender written notice thereof and a period of six (6) months thereafter (unless otherwise provided herein below) (i) to allow the financial institution or its agent(s) to continue operating as the franchisee under the franchise and; (ii) to request the City, and for the City to determine whether, to consent to the assignment of the grantee's rights, title, interest and obligations under the franchise to a qualified operator. The City acknowledges that in order for the financial institution to realize upon the collateral accorded to it by the loan documents, the financial institution must be entitled to a reasonable period of time after taking possession of the franchise under the loan document to obtain the City's consent to an assignment of the franchise to a qualified operator. The City agrees that such reasonable period of time is six (6) months after the financial institution takes possession of the cable communication system and, further, agrees that the City shall use its best efforts to decide upon the assignment of the franchise to the new operator proposed by the financial institution within such period of time. The financial institution shall be entitled to such possession and other rights granted under this paragraph until such time that the City determines whether to consent to such assignment (the "extended time"). If the City finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the City will consent to the transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. During the six-(6) month period or extended time, the financial institution shall enjoy all the rights, benefits and privileges of the grantee under the franchise, and the City shall not disturb such possession by the financial institution, provided the financial institution complies in all respects with the terms and provisions of the franchise and the Chapter. The various rights granted to the financial institution under this paragraph are contingent upon the lender's continuous compliance with the terms and provisions of this Chapter and the franchise during the entire aforementioned six-(6) month period or extended time, if applicable. For example, should an agent of the financial institution take possession of the cable communication system pursuant to rights granted to the financial institution under this paragraph, and such agent fails to comply with the level of service requirements set forth in this Chapter or the franchise, the rights granted to the financial institution under this Chapter and the franchise may be terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Chapter. 
(5)  Consent. The consent or approval of the City or any other public entity to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the public property or public rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the franchise. 
(6)  New construction. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the City will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of any new construction or substantial completion of a rebuild required by a franchise. This provision shall not apply to routine minor line extensions. 
(7)  Purchase price. The City reserves the right to review the purchase price of any transfer or assignment of the cable system. Should the City decide in the future to regulate the rates of the grantee, any negotiated sale value which the City deems unreasonable will not be considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for rate increases, if permitted by applicable law. 
(8)  Approval. Any approval by the City of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
(9)  Right of first purchase. The City reserves the right of first purchase in any transfer of the system. If the City decides to exercise this option, it shall give the grantee notice of such intent within forty-five (45) days of receipt of notice from the grantee and thereafter the City and the grantee shall effect such transfer under the same terms and conditions as the proposed transferee or on such other terms and conditions as the parties may agree.  
10.41.17 - Rights Reserved to Grantor. 
10.41.171  Right to Purchase: In the event the City revokes a franchise, pursuant to provisions of this Chapter, or fails to renew a franchise under the provisions of § 626(c)(1), F.S., (1996), the City shall have the right to purchase the franchised cable communications system. The City shall provide the grantee with notification of the City's intent to purchase within one hundred and twenty (120) days of termination. 
The date of valuation shall be no earlier than the day following the date of expiration or termination of the franchise agreement and no later than the date the City makes a fair and reasonable offer for the system or the date of transfer of ownership, whichever occurs first. 
Upon receipt of notice of the City's intent to purchase the system, the grantee and the City shall have ninety (90) days within which to negotiate the purchase price of the system. 
Upon exercise of this option, and the payment of the agreed upon sum by the City and its service of official notice of such action upon the grantee, the grantee shall immediately transfer to the City possession and title to all facilities and tangible property, real and personal, of the cable communications system, free from any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the City in lieu of some portion of the purchase price set forth above; and the grantee shall execute such warranty, deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the City as shall be necessary for this purpose. 
10.41.172  Arbitration In the event the City and grantee are unable to agree upon the value of the cable communications system within the time limits set forth above, either party may require by written notice to the other that the value of cable communications system be submitted to arbitration in the following manner: 
(1)  The City and the grantee shall each within fifteen (15) days after such written notice select an arbitrator who shall be a disinterested person with reasonable knowledge and experience relative to cable system valuation. The two arbitrators thus selected shall immediately thereafter select a third arbitrator who shall likewise be a disinterested person having reasonable knowledge and experience relative to cable system valuation. 
(2)  Within thirty (30) days after appointment of all arbitrators and upon ten (10) days' written notice to the parties, the panel of arbitrators shall commence a hearing on the issue of valuation and shall receive all relevant information from the parties. 
(3)  The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the request of either party. 
(4)  If renewal of a franchise is denied, the value of the system for purposes of this subsection shall be the fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. If a franchise is revoked, the value of the system, for purposes of this subsection shall be an equitable price within the meaning of section 627 of the Cable Act. 
(5)  Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, the panel of arbitrators shall prepare findings and decision agreed upon by a majority of the panel which shall be filed with the City and served by mail upon the grantee. The decision of the panel regarding the value of the system shall be final and binding upon the parties. Should there be no majority decision, the proceedings shall become null and void and shall be started anew, unless the parties extend by mutual agreement the time which the panel of arbitrators has to make a decision. 
(6)  Either party may seek judicial relief in the following circumstances: 
a.  a party fails to select an arbitrator; 
b.  the arbitrators fail to select a third arbitrator; 
c.  one or more arbitrators is unqualified; 
d.  designated time limits have been exceeded;

i.  based upon the record, the panel abused its discretion. 
(7)  In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that judicial relief is appropriate to the circumstances set forth above, the court in its discretion may order the arbitration procedure repeated and issue findings, orders and directions. 
(8)  The expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne by the party appointing each, and the expenses of the third arbitrator and those expenses incurred by the panel as a whole shall be borne equally by the parties.  
10.41.18 - Renewal. 
Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this Chapter, the City shall proceed with the renewal process in accordance with the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act.  
10.41.19 - Franchise Fees. 
The grantee of any franchise shall pay to the City a franchise fee in an amount designated in the franchise because 
(1)  The public rights-of-way to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county, state, and City at great expense to its taxpayers; and 
(2)  The grant to the grantee to the said streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and 
(3)  The administration of this Chapter or the franchise imposes upon the City additional regulatory responsibility and expense. 
The franchise fee shall be in addition to any other fee and commence as of the effective date of the franchise.

10.41.193  Additional Compensation: In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the City primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
10.41.194  Payments: The franchise fee and any other cost or damages assessed shall be payable monthly to the City of Fort Walton Beach. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue within the City during the period for which said monthly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the City not later than fifteen (15) days after the expiration of each calendar month. 
10.41.195  Right of Inspection, Audit: The City shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit and to re-compute any amounts determined to be payable under this Chapter. Audits shall be at the expense of the City unless the audit discloses an underpayment which equals or exceeds seven and one-half (7-1/2) percent of the payments made, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the grantee. Any additional amount due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the City which notice shall include a copy of the audit report unless written notice of disagreement if filed with the City within that time,  
10.41.20 - Forfeiture or Revocation. 
The City reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under the Chapter and the franchise grant: 
(1)  If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the material obligations under this Chapter or under such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the City and the grantee. 
(2)  If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond as required herein.

Such user fees shall be used only to accomplish the functions of the stormwater management program and utility. Such user fees shall be a monthly fee as established by a separate resolution and set forth in the comprehensive fee schedule, in accordance with the following methodology. 
(a)  Residential property. Each residential property or unit, including any single-family dwelling or unit, of any kind, within a multi-family development, shall be considered one (1) ERU for billing purposes. Monthly service charges for each residential property shall be identical and billed according to the water meter assigned to the unit. 
(b)  Commercial properties. Commercial properties shall be charged a user fee equivalent to the following formula: Base ERU = Total impervious surface on property divided by the residential ERU of 3,200 or one (1) ERU, whichever is greater.  
10.54.04 - Exemptions. 
City-owned lots or parcels, except those leased to any entity that is required to pay utilities for the leased premises, public road rights-of-ways, vacant lots or parcels, and undeveloped lots or parcels shall be classified as exempt from stormwater utility user fees.  
10.54.05 - Right of Refusal to Connect to Utility; Procedures. 
Any property owner responsible for paying the stormwater user fee, who chooses not to use stormwater management program services, may elect to develop their property in a manner that retains all run-off on-site and prevents discharge to the City's stormwater infrastructure. The property owner must verify retention of all stormwater on-site by submitting, for review and approval by the City, certified engineering drawings and calculations demonstrating that one hundred (100) percent of the total volume of runoff from the property will be retained within the property. The engineering calculations shall be based on runoff volumes from the one-hundred-year frequency rainfall event, for the following durations: one (1), two (2), four (4), eight (8) and twenty-four (24) hours and one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4), seven (7) and ten (10) days.  
10.54.06 - Mitigation Credits. 
Stormwater fee credits of up to fifty percent (50%) may be given to developed properties, demonstrating stormwater control and management facilities which generate less volume of runoff and apply best management practices (BMPs) to improve surface water quality. The amount of each available credit shall be adopted by separate resolution and set forth in the City's comprehensive fee schedule. Credits will be awarded on a four-year basis and each property owner must reestablish the right to a credit every four (4) years. A property owner may apply for a credit by submitting an application for credit, on a form approved by the City Manager, along with certified engineering drawings and calculations sufficient enough to evaluate a claim for credit.  
10.54.07 - Collection of Fees. 
Stormwater utility fees shall be collected and enforced in the same manner that water, wastewater, and solid waste fees are collected and enforced. Failure to timely pay the monthly stormwater utility fees will result in the termination of water service and may also result in the disconnection of stormwater management service(s) to the subject property in accordance with section 10.53.02, of the City's Code, as amended. The City may, at its discretion, submit a separate notice to a property owner of the annual stormwater utility fees imposed on that owner's property if such notice will facilitate the billing and collection of imposed fees.  
10.54.08 - Stormwater Utility Fund. 
There shall be established a stormwater utility fund for the deposit of all fees collected pursuant to this ordinance for the stormwater management program. The stormwater utility fund shall be used exclusively to provide services and facilities related to the stormwater management program and for the following expenditures: operation or maintenance of stormwater management facilities; costs for the planning, evaluation, design, construction, and management of the stormwater management program; administrative costs related to the management of the stormwater management program; management services, such as permit review and planning and development review related to the stormwater management program; debt service financing of capital improvements related to the stormwater management program.  
10.54.09 - Inspection, Compliance, and Enforcement. 
The City's code inspectors and other City staff as required, upon presentation of proper identification, shall be granted access for inspection of facilities, structures, or properties, discharging or suspected of discharging to the City's MS4 or waters of the United States in order to effectuate the provisions of this ordinance, investigate violations or complaints of potential violations of the terms of this ordinance, and to collect samples for review and analysis. All structures and processes which allow discharges to the City's MS4, as well as records concerning them, shall be made accessible to authorized personnel for this purpose.  
10.55 - BILLING PROCEDURES 
 
10.55.01 - Initial Billing. 
After the meter deposit has been made with the City and service has been provided, a prorated minimum consumption bill based on the actual days of service will be sent for the initial bill. The final bill will be prorated based on the number of days of service from the last reading date to the day the services are terminated.  
10.55.02 - Disconnection for Nonpayment. 
Water will be shut off after thirty (30) days from the date of the bill for nonpayment of charges, in accordance with § 180.13, F.S.  
10.55.03 - Delinquency; Discontinuance of Service. 
Each occupant of property in the City using City water shall pay to the City a fee on an account that has not been paid by the due date or upon failure to put up a deposit. Water service will be discontinued to any place having a thirty (30)-day delinquent bill or upon failure of a customer to make the appropriate deposit. The service charge is due after 9:00 a.m., thirty (30) days from the date of the bill. Further, an additional service charge shall apply, payable in advance, for a broken meter lock, a pulled meter, straight lock up, water turned on after hours, and to recheck cutoff (water restored without payment).  
10.55.04 - Final billing. 
A final bill will be computed upon the period of time a customer occupies a building after the last regular monthly meter reading. If fifteen (15) days or less has passed since this reading, a minimum charge, or consumption for water only, whichever is greater, shall be made. If more than fifteen (15) days have passed since this reading, a minimum charge for all utilities (sewer, water and garbage service) or consumption, whichever is greater, shall be made. A final bill will be computed on the basis of a minimum bill or consumption, whichever is higher, regardless of the time period between the last meter reading and termination of service. Any outstanding amount at the time of final billing will be deducted from the meter deposit on file. Should the amount due be less than the amount of the deposit, a refund will be made to the customer. Any amount due over the amount of the deposit will be billed.  
10.55.05 - Payment of Other Charges; Delinquency, Surcharges. 
The charges for the refuse and recyclable materials services provided shall be paid monthly to the City, and the City is hereby authorized to include such charges on the regular monthly statements for water and sewage service. Upon failure to pay such bill within twelve (12) days after the billing date, a surcharge of five (5) percent of the total amount of such bill shall be added to the bill. Upon failure to pay the bill in full, together with any applicable surcharge, within thirty (30) days from the billing date, all public services shall be discontinued until all required payments are made in full, plus applicable service fees, deposits and/or surcharges as may be otherwise provided.

(c)  Mixed-use establishments (i.e. establishments which utilizes water and wastewater capacity under several categories) shall have their impact fees calculated based on the sum of the individual categories applicable to the establishment. The minimum customer capacity requirement (i.e. ERC) shall be based on the highest minimum for any applicable category. 
(d)  For existing establishments that are issued additional building or plumbing permits which will subsequently increase the amount of capacity needed, or if a facility formerly classified as residential is reclassified, the impact fee shall be computed based on the difference in ERCs between the old and new classification. Should the new classification result in a customer capacity demand that is less than the previous, no rebate for fees paid shall be applicable. 
(e)  For all establishments either not listed above or listed without specific ERC units and factors, the total ERC value for water customer capacity shall be determined by dividing the numerator that is equal to the average daily demand (as provided in a certificate from the architect or engineer) by 350 gallons per day (gpd). For example: 
Total Water ERCs = Average Daily Demand 
  
 350 gpd/ERC 
The Water Impact Fee shall be determined by using the following formula: 
Total Water ERCs × $700.00 = Water Impact Fee 
(f)  For all establishments either not listed above or listed without specific ERC units and factors, the total ERC value for wastewater customer capacity shall be determined by dividing the numerator that is equal to the average daily flow (as provided in a certificate from the architect or engineer) by 300 gallons per day (gpd). For example: 
Total Water ERCs = Average Daily Demand 
  
 300 gpd/ERC 
The Wastewater Impact Fee shall be determined by using the following formula: 
Total Wastewater ERCs × $807.00 = Wastewater Impact Fee  
10.56.07 - Establishment of Funds, Expenditure Guidelines and Pledge of Revenues. 
The water impact fees collected pursuant to this ordinance shall be deposited into a fund called the "Fort Walton Beach Water System Impact Fee Fund" and the Wastewater Impact Fees shall likewise be deposited into a fund called the "Fort Walton Beach Wastewater Impact Fee Fund."  
10.56.08 - Use of Funds.

10.70.02 - Purpose. 
This Chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the City and enables the City to comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403).  
10.70.03 - Objectives. 
The objectives of this Chapter are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge. 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system. 
(3)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system. 
(4)  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal wastewater system. 
(5)  Set rates for disposal. 
(6)  This Chapter shall apply to the City and to persons outside the City who are, by contract or agreement with the City, users of the City POTW. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the superintendent of the City POTW shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this Chapter.  
10.70.04 - Enforcement. 
The City's enforcement guide for sampling, monitoring, and reporting violations is outlined in their pretreatment enforcement response plan. These are the steps that will be taken in regards to a particular circumstance. The City may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the City, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of person, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.  
10.70.05 - Actions upon Notification of Suspension. 
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The City shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge at the user's expense. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City within 15 days of the date of occurrence.  
10.70.06 - Falsifying Information. 
Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document files required to be maintained pursuant to this Chapter or wastewater contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Chapter, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided by section 1.05.  
10.70.07 - Use of Public Sewer Required. 
(1)  Prohibited deposits on public or private property. No person shall place, deposit or permit to be placed or deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property in the City, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the City, any human or animal excrement, garbage or objectionable waste. 
(2)  Prohibited discharge to natural outlets. No person shall discharge to any natural outlet in the City, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the City, any wastewater or other polluted water, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with this Chapter. 
(3)  Buildings to be connected to sewerage system. The owners of all houses, buildings or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, situated in the City and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the City, are hereby required, at their expense, to install suitable toilet facilities therein and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer, in accordance with this Chapter, within 90 days after the date of official notice to do so. 
(4)  Connection required. The City will require all developed properties to be serviced by the City's central sanitary sewer system within one year of notice by the City of availability of service. 
(5)  Connection inspection. By the year 1995, the City will complete a City-wide inspection to ensure that all developed properties are, can be connected or cannot be connected to the central sewer system. 
(6)  Septic tank and package treatment plants prohibited. The City shall continue its prohibition of the installation of package treatment plants and septic tanks.  
10.70.08 - Maintenance of Laterals. 
The applicant, user or owner of the property serviced by the City sewer service shall be responsible for maintaining the sewer pipes between the plumbing fixtures on the property and the property line in good operating condition and free from all internal obstructions.  
10.70.09 - Sewer Line Extension Policy. 
The sewer extension policy of the City shall be that the developer or customer shall pay all costs of extensions but shall not pay less than the total tap fee as outlined in this section. 
When it is determined that a sewer extension is necessary to serve a proposed development, a rough estimate will be provided to the owner and developer upon request. If the developer wishes to have a detailed estimate, a written request must be made and a financial arrangement must be made with the Finance Director in the amount of ten (10) percent of the rough estimate or ten (10) percent of the total proposed tap fee, whichever is higher, to cover the cost of design and preparation of a detailed estimate of the sewer extension. After this detailed estimate is presented to the developer, he may choose to not go any further with the proposed extension, which will cause the developer to forfeit the amount paid for the preparation of the detailed estimate, or he may choose to continue the sewer extension process. At such time, the initial financial arrangement will apply toward the construction costs or tap fees. If the developer chooses to proceed with construction, and such construction is set up as a project, he will be required to provide additional financial arrangements with the Finance Director to cover the amount of the detailed estimate or the amount of the total tap fees, whichever is greater, before construction can begin. This will be considered to be the cost of the extension.  
10.70.10 - Septic Tanks, Portable Toilets, Pleasure Boat, Travel Trailer Waste. 
Septic tank, portable toilet, pleasure boat and travel trailer waste shall not be introduced into the City's wastewater system, except at the facility located near the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Robinwood Drive, or at a meter connection provided by the City. 
This sewage shall be metered and appropriate charges paid. Charges are due and payable immediately upon the acceptance of such waste by the City. Residential and commercial customers who have sewer service available to them, but who are not connected to the sewer system, shall be charged accordingly.  
10.70.11 - Industrial Permits. 
The initial permit fee plus the sampling fee will be established and set forth in the general fee schedule plus the sampling as listed in this section. The fees for the industrial permit shall be determined by the number of samples and types of tests required of that industry. A fee shall be charged for each sample collected by the City plus the cost of analysis of the sample plus ten (10) percent of the cost of analysis. This shall be billed after the results of the test have been received.  
10.70.12 - Major Industries. 
Major industries, as defined by 40 CFR 128, and any other regulation established from time to time by the Environmental Protection Agency, or another appropriate regulating agency, shall comply with 40 CFR 128.  
10.71 - BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS 
 
10.71.01 - Permit Required to Open Sewer. 
No person shall uncover, make any connection with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a permit.  
10.71.02 - Location of Existing Sewer Tap. 
Prior to installation of a building sewer service, information on the location of sewer taps will be provided by the division of engineering after a permit for a sewer line is issued. Verification of the elevation and location shall be the responsibility of the contractor or homeowner.  
10.71.03 - Use of Old Sewers. 
Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, upon examination and test by the City, to meet all the requirements of this Chapter.  
10.71.04 - Compliance with Code. 
The size, slope, alignment and materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing codes or other applicable rules and regulations of the City. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice 9 shall apply.  
10.71.05 - Connection Fees. 
A flat tap fee shall be charged to each development per unit. An additional fee shall be charged when it is necessary to cut any paved surface. In addition to these tap fees, an additional fee may be charged as authorized by resolution of the City council. 
(1)  Single-family residential. A tap fee shall be paid for any new tap or connection made to the City sanitary sewer line. Such fee shall include all costs for providing sewer service to the property line of the property to be served. Where an existing building is serviced by a septic tank and used at the time application for City sewer service is made, the tap fee shall be the same as is required for a new tap or connection. Where the front footage of a lot or parcel exceeds one-hundred (100) feet in width, the tap fee will be calculated based on a front footage cost. The cost per foot will be determined by dividing the flat tap fee by one-hundred (100) feet; thence multiplying the cost per foot by the front footage to determine the final tap fee for the lot or parcel. 
(2)  Multifamily residential. Where more than one residential unit is constructed, a sewer tap fee will be charged. Hotels, motels, guest houses and tourist courts shall be considered to contain residential units. 
(3)  Commercial. Where a commercial development is constructed, a sewer tap fee will be charged for each business unit of four thousand (4,000) square feet or less. Where a business unit exceeds four thousand (4,000) square feet of floor area, an additional tap fee shall apply for each four thousand (4,000) square feet and portion thereof. Where a development of multiple units is constructed, the total tap fee will be based on the fee per unit as described in this section. Where a warehouse is constructed, the tap fee shall be based on the square footage of the office space provided.  
10.71.06 - Payment before Connection. 
In all cases, the applicable connection fee shall be paid to the City before the service connection is made by the City.  
10.71.07 - Elevation. 
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the lowest floor. In all buildings in which a building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.  
10.71.08 - Polluted Surface Drainage Restricted. 
No person shall connect sump pumps, roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer, unless such connection is approved by the City for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage.  
10.71.09 - Regulation of Connections to Public Sewer. 
The connection of a building sewer to the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing codes or other applicable rules and regulations of the City, or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the City before the connection is made.  
10.71.10 - Inspection, Testing. 
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the City when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the City building official or his or her representative.  
10.71.11 - Excavations Guarding. 
All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.  
10.71.12 - Damage to City Property. 
If any sidewalk, street, curb or asphalt maintained by the City or any City utility is damaged, it will be repaired by the City and billed to the party responsible for the damage on a billing work order.  
10.71.13 - Inflow During Installation. 
In the process of installing a building sewer and connecting it to a sanitary sewer, no sanitary sewer shall remain open to inflow of groundwater, surface water and/or stormwater for more than one hour.  
10.71.14 - Capping of Unused Connection Points. 
Sanitary sewers installed with unused points of connection for building sewers shall have the points of connection capped for watertight integrity prior to connection of the building sewer. The method of capping shall be one approved by the City.  
10.71.15 - City Construction in City Right-of-Way. 
A sanitary sewer line or service installed on a City right-of-way or in an easement granted to the City for the purpose of sanitary sewer lines that are to be maintained by the City shall be constructed by the City. If the City deems that assistance in the installation of such lines is necessary, construction may be performed by a private contractor, approved by the City, according to the specification set forth in this Chapter or accepted by the utilities director.

10.72.10 - Excessive Discharge. 
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or State. (Comment: Dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the requirements of this Chapter, e.g. the pH prohibition.)  
10.72.11 - Accidental Discharges. 
The user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or the substances regulated by this Chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or users own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be approved by the City before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this Chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(1)  Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.

(2)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.  
10.72.12 - Periodic Compliance Reports. 
All significant industrial users subject to a Pretreatment Standard, after the compliance date of such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the utilities department during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Superintendent, a report that contains: 
(1)  The nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such Pretreatment Standards; 
(2)  A record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported; 
(3)  The mass of pollutants regulated by Pretreatment Standards in the effluent of the user when the user is using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or requirements, because dilution is not an acceptable alternative to meet Pretreatment Standards, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. 
(4)  These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable Pretreatment Standards; 
(5)  The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable Pretreatment Standard; 
(6)  All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator. (Comment: Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in questions sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator.)  
10.72.13 - Monitoring Facilities. 
The City shall require the user, at his or her expense, to provide and operate a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems, if determined to be necessary by the City. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the Public Right-of-Way area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and any required sampling and measuring equipment required of the user shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the City.  
10.72.14 - Authority for Inspections and Sampling.

Each individually owned or operated business or commercial establishment which is housed in a building that is separated by a partition wall from an adjacent business and is directly accessible to the public from the outside will be considered a separate unit.  
10.75.05 - Surcharge. 
To the established rates and charges, there shall be added a surcharge based on the following formula. This surcharge shall be applied to all users whose sewage has suspended solids or biochemical oxygen demand in excess of the following concentrations: 
(a)  BOD: 220 ppm, and 
(b)  suspended solids: 200 ppm. 
The additional charge for sewage having concentrations in excess of these amounts shall be based on the cost per 1,000 gallons determined according to the following formula: 
Surcharge = [(B-220) + (S-200)] 8.34 × $0.24 = Cost/1,000 gals. 
 
    1,000 
The surcharge cost will be multiplied by the user's metered water consumption (in 1,000 gallons). The calculated amount will then be added to the charges computed under the City's normal rate schedule to arrive at the user's total monthly bill.  
10.75.06 - Toxic Pollutants. 
Any user discharging any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the City's treatment works shall pay the cost of such additional expense as determined by the City.  
10.75.07 - Discharge. 
If the user is discharging less water than is being purchased and wants to be billed for only the discharged amount, then the user must install a metering device. If the user is discharging more water than is being purchased, the City will require the user to install a metering device. This metering device shall be purchased, installed and maintained by the user but be approved by the City. Monthly readings will be provided to the City to calculate the sewer bill for the month. Annual calibrations will be required with copies provided to the City.  
10.75.08 - Nonresident Surcharge. 
Provided that there are not franchise agreements to the contrary, for all sewer service supplied outside the City limits, there shall be added to the foregoing rate a minimum surcharge of twenty-five (25) percent. A higher surcharge for outside City use may be imposed at the discretion of the Council.  
10.75.09 - Adjustments. 
The City Manager is hereby authorized to make administrative adjustments of the rates prescribed in this section in cases where hardship would be placed on an individual account or where application of the rate does not provide an average billing increase. 
The City Council may, by resolution, make any adjustments to the rates as it may deem necessary and proper.  
10.75.10 - Other Water not Put into System. 
If a business uses water for business purposes (such as concrete companies, landscaping, etc.) and the water used does not enter the City sewerage system, monthly billing will be made for consumption of water only, not for sewage and water charges. In order to qualify for this exemption, two meters will be required; one to serve the business purpose and one to serve normal sewage requirements.

PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a publication of the Land Development Code of the City of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Land Development Code were furnished electronically by the City of Fort Walton Beach. The source of each section is included in the Table of Historical Notes and References following each chapter. The absence of a section in the table indicates that the section remains unchanged from the original codification. The text and tables of this Land Development Code were furnished electronically by the City of Fort Walton Beach. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The Land Development Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the chapter, section, and subsection. Thus, section 6.04.050 is subsection .050, located in section 6.04 of chapter 6. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and sections are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Kayla Jewell, Editor, and Aline True, Quality Control Supervisor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kim Barnes, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Land Development Code which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

2.  Whether the uses within the requested zoning district are compatible with the uses in adjacent zoning districts. Compatibility is determined by considering scale of use; intensity of use as determined by floor area ratio and impervious surface coverage; hours of operation; impacts from noise in parking lots or structures; noise from outdoor gathering places (recreation areas, plazas, courtyards); noise from outdoor speakers; noise from processes such as from body shops, equipment shops, and industrial activities; lighting from parking lots or structures and vehicles; and security lighting. Compatibility shall consider the range of allowable uses on parcels adjacent to the proposed rezoning parcel and the typical impacts for those uses. 
3.  Whether the requested use is substantially more intense or less intense than allowable development on adjacent parcels. The range of uses permissible according to the land use category and zoning district on the adjacent parcels is the basis for determination. The existence of a nonconforming use on adjacent parcels which is substantially more or less intense than the requested zoning shall not establish the sole reason for denial of the requested zoning. 
4.  Whether the requested use is based on soil types, topography, protection of natural resources, and protection of designated historic areas.

CHAPTER 3 - ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE PROTECTION 
3.00.00 - GENERALLY 

3.00.01 - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to protect the existing natural resources in the City. These standards preserve the natural environment, and protect wildlife habitat and migration corridors. 
3.00.02 - Applicability. 
    The standards in this chapter shall apply to all new development and redevelopment within the City, except for development on lots of record that were approved for single-family residential use prior to the effective date of this LDC. 
3.01.00 - ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE LANDS AND HABITATS 

3.01.01 - Wetlands and Shoreline Protection. 
A.  The natural function of wetlands within the City shall be protected. Potential wetlands are identified in the Comprehensive Plan; however, final delineation shall be established by an independent survey conducted in accordance with the methodology set forth in the Florida Statutes. The applicant may request that the delineation survey be conducted by the City. A fee is established in the City fee schedule for such delineation survey. 
1.  Wetlands shall not be removed, altered, or destroyed, except where permitted and mitigated as required by the Florida DEP, NWFWMD, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Proof of permit shall be provided to the City. Areas approved for mitigation shall be protected through a conservation easement with the City as a party to the easement. 
2.  A de minimus exemption may be granted by the Florida DEP, NWFWMD, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Where exempted, proof of exemption shall be provided to the City. 
3.  Where an applicant is exempt from permitting requirements of the State of Florida or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the City shall determine whether a local development permit is required to protect the natural function of wetlands. The local development permit requirements are set forth in Chapter 9. 
B.  Setbacks required. 
1.  Principal buildings and all site development shall be setback from wetlands and water bodies a minimum of ten (10) feet. 
2.  Within the required setback the following activities are permissible: 
a.  Marinas; 
b.  Piers; 
c.  Boardwalks; 
d.  Walking trails; 
e.  Riprap, but not shoreline armoring; 
f.  Installation of buoys or other aids to navigation; 
g.  Fences; 
h.  Bridges, both pedestrian and vehicular; or 
i.  Docks. 
3.  Development activity which is determined by the City to be water dependent or water related may be allowed. 
4.  Native vegetation located within the required setback on estuarine shorelines shall be protected. Where removal of native vegetation is permissible, replacement of such vegetation shall be required. 
3.01.02 - Habitat Protection. 
A.  It is the purpose of this section to provide standards necessary to protect the habitats of species, both flora and fauna, of endangered, threatened, or special concern status in the City. It is the intent of this section to require that an appropriate amount of land shall be set aside to protect habitat of rare, endangered, or special concern plant and animal species. 
B.  Areas subject to the standards of this section shall be those identified in the Comprehensive Plan as habitat for rare and endangered species, threatened species, or species of special concern. 
C.  A habitat management plan shall be prepared as a prerequisite to the approval of any development proposed on a site containing areas subject to this section. The habitat management plan shall be prepared by an ecologist, biologist, or other related professional. The plan shall document the presence of affected species, the land needs of the species that may be met on the development site, and shall recommend appropriate habitat management plans and other measures to protect the subject wildlife.

1.  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
5.  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
6.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
7.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
8.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters, and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
10.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges.

2.  Determination by the Board of Adjustment that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and

4.06.00 - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUD) 

4.06.01 - Generally. 
A.  Purpose and intent. A planned unit development (PUD) is an overlay available to encourage flexibility in the design and development of land and allow improved design and quality in new development. The PUD is intended to provide for diversification and integration of uses and structures consistent with the underlying zoning district. The PUD is specifically intended to: 
1.  Promote more efficient and economic uses of land; 
2.  Lower development and building costs by permitting smaller networks of utilities and streets and the use of more economical building types and shared facilities; 
3.  Provide for open spaces and common areas and provide usable and suitably located recreation facilities within the development; and 
4.  Allow clustering or other innovative designs to protect sensitive environmental areas within the proposed site. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  A proposal for a PUD overlay district shall be an entirely voluntary procedure. 
2.  The minimum area of a PUD overlay district shall be two (2) acres. 
3.  The PUD overlay district shall be permissible in all zoning districts. 
4.  A PUD requires a preliminary and final site development plan prepared, reviewed, and approved according to the procedures set forth in Chapter 9. 
5.  A PUD requires a preliminary and final plat approval, if applicable, according to the procedures set forth in Chapter 9. 
6.  Preliminary and final site development plans and plats may be combined upon approval of the Development Administrator. 
C.  Uses. Permissible uses in a PUD are limited to those identified for the underlying zoning district, as set forth in Table 2.03.02. 
4.06.02 - Site Development Standards. 
A.  A proposed PUD shall include design standards necessary to meet the unique design requirements of the proposed development, in compliance with the following: 
1.  The maximum residential density shall not exceed the permissible maximum density of the underlying zoning district. 
2.  The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) shall not exceed the permissible FAR of the underlying zoning district. 
3.  The setback on the perimeter of the development parcel shall not be less than required by the underlying zoning district. 
4.  Building height and building height compatibility, consistent with the standards set forth in Sections 4.00.02 and 4.00.03. 
5.  Maximum lot coverage for the underlying zoning district. 
6.  Parking.

11.  All remaining aspects of the proposed development shall comply with the standards of the underlying zoning district and the requirements of this LDC. 
B.  Upon approval and recordation of the final development plan for a PUD, the site development standards contained in the final development plan shall be binding upon all future development on the PUD site. The PUD may be amended as contained in Chapter 9, Administrative Procedures. 
4.06.03 - Compatibility Standards. 
    A PUD provides the means to depart from the site development standards required for the underlying zoning district. The purpose of this departure is to allow flexibility in design toward the end of creating better design and higher quality development. However, the variation in site development standards also has the potential for incompatibility with adjacent development. Therefore, a proposed PUD shall demonstrate that compatibility is maintained in compliance with the following standards: 
A.  Landscaped buffers shall be provided at the perimeter of the development parcel when the adjacent zoning district provides for less intense development as measured by residential density and floor area ratio. 
B.  Plazas, courtyards, recreation facilities, and outdoor gathering spaces shall be located and buffered to protect adjacent properties from noise and loss of privacy. 
C.  Outdoor lighting for security, pedestrian paths, parking lots, and other purposes shall be shielded and directed to avoid glare and spillover onto adjacent properties. 
D.  Parking lots, drive-thru lanes, and loading areas shall be located and buffered to protect adjacent properties from noise, light, and loss of privacy. 
E.  Dumpsters shall not be located at the perimeter adjacent to property zoned for residential use. 
F.  Loudspeakers, including equipment for fast-food restaurant ordering, shall be located to protect adjacent property zoned for residential use from noise. 
4.06.04 - Conditions of Approval. 
    Specific conditions may be required to address compatibility, including conditions to address the situations identified in Section 4.06.03, and any other compatibility factors that may be identified during the review process.

The City shall be a party to the agreement. The agreement shall include a requirement that the property owner shall be responsible for any expenses of a traffic and/or parking study to address the need for the deferred spaces. 
6.  The property owner may at any time request approval of a revised development plan to allow converting the deferred spaces to operable parking spaces. 
H.  A parking study to support shared parking requirements shall meet the following standards: 
1.  The parking spaces for joint use shall be located within 300 feet of the respective uses they are intended to serve. 
2.  The study shall include sufficient data to demonstrate that the hours of maximum demand for parking at the respective uses do not normally overlap. 
3.  The study shall contain sufficient information to demonstrate that the joint use of parking and subsequent reduction in the total number of otherwise required parking spaces will not have a negative impact on adjacent properties. 
4.  The owner of parcels proposing to share parking shall enter into an agreement guaranteeing the joint access and use of the parking spaces to meet parking needs of all properties represented in the agreement.

    Reserved 
CHAPTER 8 - VARIATIONS FROM STANDARDS IN THE LDC 
8.00.00 - GENERALLY 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide mechanisms for obtaining relief from the provisions of this LDC where hardship would otherwise occur. There are several ways that potential relief from hardship is addressed: potential relief through requirements regarding the use of and changes to nonconforming development; potential relief through the grant of a variance from the site development standards of this LDC; potential relief when an administrative decision is appealed; and potential relief when an administrative waiver is granted to modify certain site development standards of this LDC. 

8.00.01 - Waiver of Standards Pertaining to Metal Buildings. 
    The Local Planning Agency may approve a waiver of standards pertaining to metal building, provided the following standards are met: 
A.  The proposed metal building shall be consistent with the character of the neighborhood within 500 feet of the site of the metal building. 
B.  The metal building shall be designed to ensure compatibility with development in the zoning district in which it is proposed. 
C.  The metal building and the site on which it is proposed are designed to minimize potential detrimental impacts on properties within 500 feet of the development site. The determination that potential detrimental impacts are minimized shall be based on the following: 
1.  Proposed architectural design of the metal building; 
2.  Proposed placement of the metal building on the site and the relationship to open space on the site; 
3.  Proposed fencing and screening; and 
4.  Proposed landscaping. 
8.01.00 - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS 

8.01.01 - Generally. 
A.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to address the continuation and potential modification of uses, structures, lots, and site features that meet the following conditions: 
1.  A use, structure, lot, or site feature that was lawfully established and in compliance with regulations applicable to the use, structure, lot, or site feature at the time of establishment of such use, structure, lot, or site feature; and 
2.  Such use, structure, lot, or site feature does not comply with the regulations set forth in this LDC. 
    This situation is called a nonconformity. 
B.  It is the intent of the City to: 
1.  Establish two (2) types of nonconformities: benign and detrimental; 
2.  Allow continuation of nonconformities until such nonconformities are abandoned; 
3.  Allow change of use of specified nonconformities; 
4.  Allow modifications to specified nonconformities; and 
5.  Eliminate or reduce detrimental nonconformities. 
C.  It is further the intent of the City that the casual, intermittent, temporary, or illegal use of land, water, buildings, structures, characteristics of use, or any such use in combination shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use to create rights in the continuance of such use. 
D.  Maintenance. Normal and customary maintenance or repair of nonconforming lots, sites, and structures shall be allowed, provided that such maintenance or repair does not otherwise increase the extent of the nonconformity. Maintenance or repair shall be performed only to ensure safety and to prevent a nuisance. 
E.  Relocation of nonconforming buildings or structures. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to another location within the City, unless the lot, site, and resulting structure placement conforms in all respects to the standards and requirements of this LDC. 
8.01.02 - Types of Nonconformities. 
A.  Benign nonconformities. 
1.  A benign nonconformity exists when the degree of nonconformity does not result in a harmful or unsafe condition. A negative impact on public safety or health is not expected to occur due to the continuation or modification of a benign nonconformity. 
2.  Only the following situations shall be considered benign nonconformities: 
a.  An encroachment into a required setback of less than ten (10) percent. 
b.  A lot area which is less than the minimum required by not more than ten (10) percent. 
c.  A lot width which is less than the minimum required by not more than ten (10) percent. 
d.  A building height which is more than the maximum allowed by not more than ten (10) percent. 
e.  A front yard setback that fails to comply with the standards in this LDC due to road widening. 
f.  Provision of off-street parking that contains up to ten (10) percent fewer spaces than required by this LDC. 
g.  Impervious surface coverage in excess of maximum allowed. 
B.  Detrimental nonconformities. 
1.  Any use of land or structure that does not comply with the uses permissible in the applicable zoning district, as set forth in Chapter 2, shall be considered to be a detrimental nonconformity. 
2.  Any nonconformity of a structure or site that is not identified as a benign nonconformity in Section 8.01.02.A shall be considered to be a detrimental nonconformity. 
8.01.03 - Continuation of Nonconformities. 
A.  A benign or detrimental nonconformity shall be allowed to continue except as follows: 
1.  The nonconformity is declared to be unsafe or unlawful. 
2.  The nonconformity is declared to be a public nuisance. 
B.  A detrimental nonconformity which is discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days shall be considered abandoned. 
1.  Such nonconformity shall not thereafter be reinstated. 
2.  Any subsequent occupancy of such nonconformity shall be permissible only when such nonconformity has been brought into compliance with the requirements of this LDC. 
3.  The removal of buildings, structures, equipment, or other aspects of such nonconforming use; the absence of a water utility service deposit or account; or the absence of a current business tax receipt shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence of the discontinuance of a nonconformity. 
4.  If the reason for discontinuance is the documented action by a governmental agency, the time of delay caused by the governmental agency shall not be calculated as part of the period of discontinuance. 
C.  A benign nonconformity may be discontinued for any period of time and shall not be considered abandoned. 
8.01.04 - Change of Use. 
A.  All rights and obligations associated with a nonconformity shall run with the ownership of the land or water, are not personal to the present owner or tenant of the nonconforming use of land or water, and are not affected by a change in ownership or tenancy, except if abandoned. 
B.  Benign nonconformities. A land use carried out in or on a lot, site, or structure that has been identified as a benign nonconformity may be changed to any use permissible in the zoning district in which it is located, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 2.03.04. The nonconformities are not required to be modified for compliance with the standards of this LDC. 
C.  Detrimental nonconformities. The use of a lot, site, or structure identified as a detrimental nonconformity may be changed, provided the following standards are met: 
1.  The new use is less intense than the existing use. Intensity shall be determined by impervious surface coverage and either density for residential uses or the floor area ratio for nonresidential uses; or 
2.  The new use complies with the requirements of this LDC. 
8.01.05 - Damage and Restoration of Nonconforming Buildings or Structures. 
A.  In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged by any means, including fire, flood, wind, explosion, or other act of God, or act of the public enemy, to an extent of less than fifty (50) percent of the total assessed value of the building or structure, such building or structure shall be permitted to be replaced, restored, or reconstructed according to the development standards in effect at the time of original construction. The assessed value shall be determined by an independent appraisal establishing value on the date of the damage event. Where an independent appraisal is not provided, the assessed value shall be the most recent taxable value shown for the structure as determined by the Okaloosa County Property Appraiser on January 1 of the year in which the damage occurred. 
B.  Replacement, restoration, and reconstruction shall be permissible only in compliance with building, plumbing, electrical, gas, mechanical, fire, and other construction and life safety regulations in effect at the time of application for a local development permit to allow such replacement, restoration, or reconstruction. 
C.  Permits for replacement, restoration, or reconstruction shall not be issued after twenty-four (24) months have elapsed since the damage event. 
8.01.06 - Expansion or Modification of Benign Nonconformities. 
A.  A structure which is a benign nonconformity may be modified or expanded, subject to the following standards: 
1.  Any addition or expansion of the structure shall comply with the standards applicable to the zoning district as set forth in this LDC; 
2.  Any addition or expansion of the structure shall not increase the extent of the nonconformity; and 
3.  Any addition or expansion of a structure shall comply with all local development permit requirements as set forth in Chapter 9. 
B.  A lot or site which is a benign nonconformity may be modified, subject to the following standards; 
1.  Any additional structures or site features shall comply with the standards set forth in this LDC;

9.03.02 - Certificate of Concurrency Required. 
A.  A certificate of concurrency shall be required prior to or concurrent with the issuance of a development order, including de minimis situations. 
1.  The requirement for a certificate of concurrency shall not apply to properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Florida Master Site File. 
2.  Where multiple development permits are required, the issuance of the certificate of concurrency shall occur prior to the issuance of the initial local development permit. 
B.  A certificate of concurrency shall be issued upon a finding that the determination of concurrency demonstrates the availability of capacity to serve the proposed development. 
1.  The certificate of concurrency shall include the condition that facilities with the required capacity shall be in place and available to serve new development or as otherwise provided in State law. 
2.  For potable water, the certificate of concurrency shall include the condition that prior to approval of a building permit, the City shall determine that adequate water supplies to serve the new development will be available no later than the anticipated date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
C.  A certificate of concurrency shall automatically expire simultaneously with the expiration of the local development permit to which it applies. If a time extension is granted prior to the expiration of a local development permit, then the accompanying certificate of concurrency shall be automatically extended for the length of the time extension. 
D.  A certificate of concurrency shall be issued in writing and signed by the Development Administrator. 
9.03.03 - Determination of Concurrency. 
    A determination of concurrency is a demonstration that the proposed impact on the specified public services and facilities does not exceed the capacity based on the minimum level of service standard. 
A.  Level of Service Standards. 
1.  The minimum level of service standard for potable water is 125 gallons of potable water per person per day. 
2.  The minimum level of service standard for wastewater is 115 gallons of wastewater per person per day. 
3.  The minimum level of service standard for solid waste is six and eight-tenths (6.8) pounds per person per day. 
4.  The minimum level of service standard for recreation is four and thirty-two one-hundredths (4.32) acres of recreation land per 1,000 people. 
5.  The minimum level of service standard for stormwater runoff quantity is to retain the first one (1) inch on site and ensure that the post-development runoff rate does not exceed the predevelopment runoff rate for a twenty-five (25) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm event. The minimum level of service standard for stormwater runoff quality shall be as set forth in Chapter 62-25, F.A.C. 
6.  The minimum level of service standard for arterial and collector roads outside the adopted Transportation Concurrency Exception Area (TCEA) is "D". There is no minimum level of service standard within the TCEA. However, proposed development within the TCEA shall provide facilities that improve mobility, based on the requirements set forth in Section 6.01.06. 
7.  The minimum level of service for public schools is 100 percent of the capacity established by the Department of Education for schools serving the City. 
B.  The concurrency calculation and determination shall compare the available capacity of each required facility or service to the demand of the proposed development. 
1.  The required facilities to meet the level of service standard for stormwater runoff shall be determined by the calculation of stormwater impacts as set forth in the Engineering Standards Manual of Fort Walton Beach. 
2.  The available capacity for the transportation system shall be determined by the provision of a transportation or traffic study as set forth in Section 9.02.04.B. 
3.  The available capacity of all remaining facilities and services with an adopted level of service standard shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  Establishing the capacity of the facility or service; 
b.  Subtracting the capacity used by existing development; 
c.  Subtracting the capacity committed to approved developments through issuance of certificates of concurrency; and 
d.  Yielding the amount of capacity remaining and available to serve proposed development. 
C.  The available capacity may be adjusted based on planned expansions to capacity that guarantee an increase in capacity prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the proposed development. 
D.  The required capacity may be established in an approved development agreement, in compliance with the requirements in Section 9.08.00. 
9.03.04 - De Minimis Projects. 
A.  Generally. 
1.  A proposed development may be determined to have a de minimis impact on one (1) or more facilities and services with an adopted level of service standard, as set forth in Section 9.03.02. 
2.  A proposed development with a de minimis impact shall be exempt from any further concurrency determination. 
B.  The following situations are considered de minimis for all facilities and services with an adopted level of service standard. 
1.  A single-family dwelling. 
2.  A nonresidential structure with fewer than 1,500 square feet of total floor area and generating fewer than fifty (50) trips per day. 
3.  A building addition with fewer than 1,500 square feet of total floor area and generating fewer than fifty (50) trips per day. 
C.  Any proposed development or redevelopment with an impact of not more than one (1) percent of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service of the affected transportation facilities as determined by the City, utilizing the most recent table of the generated two-way peak hour volumes in the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Level of Service Handbook, shall be considered de minimis regarding the transportation level of service. No impact shall be deemed to be de minimis if the sum of existing roadway volumes from approved projects on a transportation facility would exceed 110 percent of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service of the affected transportation facility, or if the impact would exceed the adopted level of service standard for any affected designated hurricane evacuation route. 
9.03.05 - Strategies to Rectify a Lack of Concurrency. 
    Where available capacity cannot be demonstrated and a certificate of concurrency has been denied, the following methods may be used to maintain adopted level of service: 
A.  The applicant may provide the necessary improvements to maintain level of service. In such case the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements, documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service as required in Section 9.03.03, and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction, consistent with determination of concurrency as set forth in Section 9.03.03. 
B.  The proposed project may be altered such that the projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service. 
C.  The construction of any development project may be phased or staged so as to coincide with the phased or staged construction of infrastructure facilities so that the levels of service for such facilities are maintained upon completion of each phase or stage of the development project.
