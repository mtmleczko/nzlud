PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a publication of the Charter and Related Laws, City Code of Ordinances and the Land Development Code of the City of St. Cloud, Florida. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this publication, the reader can locate any provision included herein. 
    A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the publication is included at the back of this publication. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Subpart A - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Subpart A, "Charter," contains the basic Charter, Laws of Fla. ch. 65-2166, as amended. The acts and ordinances from which the various sections are derived have been set out as enacted or amended, including the respective numbering system and catchlines thereof. In many instances catchlines were added where there were none, or were altered to reflect more accurately the content of the various sections. The substantive content of the various sections has in no way been altered or changed, although in some instances, words in brackets were added to the text, either to correct obvious errors or to clarify the meaning where the same is ambiguous. When a section has been amended, only that section as amended is set out herein; similarly repealed provisions have been deleted. In this regard, the editors have reserved sections where appropriate in order to maintain the numerical sequence of section numbers. History notes, enclosed in parentheses, following each section indicate the derivation. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Sec. 2-189. - Extraordinary expenses and services. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Extraordinary expense shall be that expense and those related costs and fees that are incurred by the city for any extraordinary service including, but not limited to, the city's actual cost of labor and materials associated with the use of any specialized extinguishing or abatement agent, chemical, neutralizer or similar equipment (or equipment damage) or materials that are employed to extinguish, confine, neutralize, contain or clean any hazardous material that is or may be involved in a fire, accidental spill, or the threat of any fire or accidental spill. 
    Extraordinary service is one performed by the city fire department or any other city department or bureau that, in the judgment of the city manager or his designee, is additional to or above the normal services provided by such departments or bureaus. "Extraordinary services" may include, but are not limited to, crowd safety, security and traffic control; evacuation and emergency housing; the abatement and disposition of hazardous materials; spills or the threat of spills of toxic chemicals; leaks or threats of leaks of toxic or hazardous gases; other imminent or perceived or possible threats to the health, safety or welfare of the city residents that may be detailed or contemplated in the definition of "extraordinary expense"; and those instances where a property owner has been previously warned about violations of the City Code that, in the judgment of the city manager or his designee, are a particular threat to the health, safety or welfare of the city residents, and for which the owner (or owner's agent, or person in charge of the property) has neglected to comply or has refused compliance therewith. 
(b)  Administration. The city manager or his designee shall collect all fees as follows: 
(1)  Fees and costs shall encompass all manpower, equipment (or equipment damage), material and maintenance expenses in such a form as to ensure for the city's full reimbursement for charges for those services actually rendered. A particular cost or fee schedule need not be memorialized in this section or elsewhere in the city Code or by further formal action by the city council, the city council's approval of this section constituting an authorization for the city manager or his designee to collect all such fees and costs pursuant to his receipt of related expenditures or costs that are submitted to him by the affected city departments or bureaus. 
(2)  Within 30 days of the date of the extraordinary or dangerous occurrence giving rise to the extraordinary service, the affected department or bureau shall submit its extraordinary service-related costs, fees, charges, expenses, or any of these things or all of these things in combination, to the city manager or his designee for his review. At such time as all costs, fees and so forth related to extraordinary services have been collected and reviewed by the city manager or his designee, but in any case not later than 60 days from the date of the rendering of the extraordinary services, the city manager or his designee shall send a bill of consolidated costs, fees and so forth to the property owner, agent or manager, with a demand that a full remittance be made within 30 days of receipt of the bill. 
(3)  It is also contemplated that local, state or federal agencies may bill, fine or penalize the city for matters (including, but not limited to, a cleanup cost, fee or expense) relating to an extraordinary or dangerous occurrence, and the city manager or his designee shall, if possible, include any and all such costs or fees in the consolidated bill sent to the property owner. The city shall not, however, waive any right to collect such local, state or federal costs if they are not included with the consolidated bill, and are not charged to the property owner or his agent within the consolidated billing (60-day) period. In this regard, the city manager or his designee shall expect reimbursement of all local, state or federal costs within 30 days of the owner's (or his agent's) receipt of the bill for these particular costs, fees and so forth. 
(4)  In cases of hardship or where circumstances are such that a full remittance cannot be made to the city within the 30-day period, the city council shall hereby authorize the city manager or his designee to enter into negotiations with the property owner or his agent for an extended payback period of time not to exceed six months, and for which the city may charge the state statutorily mandated interest payment on judgments, pursuant to F.S. §§ 55.03 and 55.04. 
(5)  All monies received under the provisions of this section shall be placed in an account established for the express purpose of reimbursing the various city departments and bureaus for those actual costs and expenses necessary to furnish fire, police and other emergency or public safety services or protection provided by the city as outlined herein. 
(c)  Litigation. The city may enforce the provisions of this section by civil actions in a court of competent jurisdiction for the collection of any amounts due hereunder, plus attorney's fees or for any other relief that may be appropriate. 
(d)  Municipal services not to be refused for nonpayment. Nothing in this section shall authorize any city department or bureau, or any department personnel or bureau personnel, to refuse or delay any municipal service to any person, firm, organization or corporation that has not reimbursed the city for an extraordinary municipal service as provided under this section. Furthermore, nothing in this section shall be construed to demand reimbursement to the city for those municipal services that are normally provided to city residents and others as a matter of the city's general operating procedures, and for which the levying of taxes or the demand for reimbursement is normally made.

Sec. 2-211. - Budget message. 
    The city manager's message shall explain the budget in fiscal terms and in terms of the work programs. It shall outline the proposed financial policies of the city for the ensuing fiscal year, describe the important features of the budget, indicate any major changes from the current year in financial policies, expenditures, and revenues together with the reasons for such changes, summarize the city's debt position and include such other materials as the manager deems desirable or which the city council may require. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 65-2166, § 6.03; Code 1994, § 2-161) 
Sec. 2-212. - Amendments after adoption. 
(a)  Supplemental appropriations. If, during the fiscal year, the manager certifies that there are available for appropriation revenue in excess of those estimated in the budget, the city council may, by resolution, make supplemental appropriations for the year up to the amount of each excess. 
(b)  Emergency appropriations. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public peace, the city council may make emergency appropriations. Such appropriations may be made by resolution. To the extent that there are no available unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations, the council may by such resolution authorize the issuance of emergency notes, which may be renewed from time to time, but the emergency notes and renewals of any fiscal year shall be paid not later than the last day of the fiscal year succeeding that in which the emergency appropriations were made. 
(c)  Reduction of appropriations. If, at any time during the fiscal year, it appears probable to the manager that the revenues available will be insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to the city council without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial action taken by him and his recommendations as to any other steps to be taken. The council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to prevent or minimize any deficit and for that purpose it may reduce one or more appropriations. 
(d)  Transfer of appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year, the manager may, on notification to the city council, transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation balance among programs within a department, office or agency and, upon written request by the manager, the council may, by resolution, transfer all or part of any unencumbered appropriation balance from one department, office or agency to another. 
(e)  Limitations; effective date. No appropriation may be reduced below any amount required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the unencumbered balance thereof. The supplemental and emergency appropriations and reduction of or transfer of appropriations authorized by this section may be made effective immediately upon adoption.

Sec. 2-213. - Lapse of appropriations. 
    Every appropriation, except an appropriation for a capital expenditure, shall lapse at the close of the fiscal year to the extent that it has not been expended or is unencumbered. The foregoing sentence shall not be interpreted so as to be in conflict with Charter section 6.06(c). An appropriation for a capital expenditure will continue in force until the purpose for which it was made has been accomplished or abandoned; the purpose of any such appropriation shall be deemed abandoned if three years pass without any disbursement from, or encumbrance of, the appropriation. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 65-2166, § 6.10; Code 1994, § 2-163) 
Sec. 2-214. - Administration budget. 
(a)  Work programs and allotments. At such times as the manager shall specify, each department, office or agency shall submit work programs for the ensuing fiscal year showing the requested allotments of its appropriations within the year. The manager shall review and authorize such allotments with or without revision as early as possible in the fiscal year. He may revise such allotments during the year if he deems it desirable and shall revise them to accord with any supplemental, emergency, reduced or transferred appropriations made pursuant to section 2-212. 
(b)  Payments and obligations prohibited. No payment shall be made or obligation incurred against any allotment or appropriation except in accordance with appropriations duly made and unless the manager or his designee first certifies that there is an unencumbered balance in such allotment or appropriation and that sufficient funds therefrom are or will be available to cover the claim or meet the obligation when it becomes due and payable. Any authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the provisions of the Charter shall be void and any payments so made illegal; such action shall be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or made such payment or incurred such obligation, and he shall be liable to the city for any amount so paid. However, except where prohibited by law, nothing in the Charter shall be construed to prevent the making or authorizing of payments or making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds or to prevent the making of any contract or lease for providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year, provided that such action is made or approved by resolution.

Sec. 6-33. - Purpose. 
    The intent of the city in adopting this article is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations for the adult entertainment industry that will protect the health, safety, property values and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city. It is not the intent of the city council to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity. These matters are regulated by federal and state law, including F.S. ch. 847.

Sec. 6-34. - Findings of fact. 
    Based on evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the city council and on the findings incorporated in the United States Attorney General Commission on Pornography (1986), Jacksonville Ordinance Code, Chapter 410, Ord. No. 77-257-256, Section 1, the Los Angeles Municipal Code, Section 12.70, Ord. No. 156509 (1982), the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, 66,0000, Ord. No. 742-G, Section 1, 10-24-72, and "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984, and the findings of fact set out in Section 5 of the Adult Entertainment Code of Osceola County, Florida, a county in Central Florida, and evidence and affidavits presented by the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation of the Ninth Judicial Circuit of Florida, the city commission hereby finds: 
(1)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter or instruments, novelties, devices or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(2)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where dancers, entertainers, performers or other individuals who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(3)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur at establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the health, safety, economy, property values and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism, by persons seeking to bring children to visit attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere. 
(4)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are present in establishments, other activities which are illegal, unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(5)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are competitively exploited in establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection (4) of this section, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(6)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur often are constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior signs or appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(7)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(8)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
(9)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property, harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce and community environment. 
(10)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur. 
(11)  Employees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(12)  Physical contact or touching within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur between employees exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(13)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur. 
(14)  The potential dangers to the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(15)  Requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur to keep a list of information concerning current employees and certain recent past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(16)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(17)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and pose a threat to the health of the participants and promote the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.

(e)  Revocation and transfer of permits. 
(1)  Revocation. A permit may be revoked by the city for the following reasons: 
a.  If a permit holder fails to obtain chickens within six months of obtaining the permit. 
b.  If a permit holder discontinues raising chickens for a six-month period. 
c.  If any condition of the chicken-keeping permit has been violated, the city may revoke the permit immediately if the violation has not been remedied within seven days after written notice of the violation.

f.  A person aggrieved by a decision to deny or revoke a chicken-keeping temporary permit may appeal to the city manager or their designee.

(3)  Relocation. Any active temporary permit holder who relocates to a new location may apply for a chicken-keeping temporary permit without having to be waitlisted behind property owners who do not currently have a temporary permit. The reason is to allow continuity of ownership for existing chickens in the City of St. Cloud. 
(4)  Cancellation. If a participant chooses to discontinue backyard chicken-keeping, they must provide notice to the city and remove the coop and pen within 30 days of the notice being given. Once a temporary permit is surrendered, the city is authorized to re-issue the temporary permit to another qualified applicant.

Sec. 12-155. - Issuance, revocation, and renewal of pain medication license. 
(a)  Approval and issuance. Following consideration of the application for pain medication license by the development review committee, the committee shall forward its recommendation for approval, denial, or conditional approval of the license to the city manager or his/her designee and the city manager or his/her designee shall place the application, with recommendations, on the next available city council agenda, for public hearing. Upon approval or conditional approval of an application for a pain medication license by the city council, based on the criteria of this article, the pain medication license shall be issued, for a period of one year. 
(b)  Revocation, suspension, or imposition of additional conditions and/or restrictions. 
(1)  If, at any time, the city manager or his/her designee determines that any pain medication license holder has failed to comply with any applicable conditions of its license, or is operating in a manner harmful to the public health, safety or welfare and not in compliance with the terms of this article he/she may place on the city council public hearing agenda an item to determine whether the pain medication license should be revoked. The city manager or his/her designee shall prepare a report with analysis showing the compliance or non-compliance with the following criteria: 
a.  During the operation of the pain management clinic or non-exempt pharmacy, the pain medication license holder has or has not complied with all conditions imposed at the time of license issuance; or 
b.  During the operation of the pain management clinic or non-exempt pharmacy, the pain medication license holder has or has not taken all reasonable precautions to discourage unlawful activity, including vandalism, crimes against property or persons, disturbances, loitering of patrons, narcotics use or distribution, excessive noise, vehicular use by impaired patrons, and illegal activity of any kind by employees, patrons or others associated with the establishment; or

(3)  Within 30 days of the suspension of the operation of the facility, as noted above, a public hearing on said revocation, suspension, or imposition of additional conditions shall be conducted in the manner described in section 12-152. The city council will consider the matter de novo, and will determine whether the city manager or his/her designee was justified in revoking and/or suspending the pain medication license. The presumption of the correctness of the decision may be overcome by the license holder, upon a showing of competent substantial evidence that the finding of the city manager or his/her designee was not correct. The burden of proof will be on the applicant seeking the reinstatement of a revoked license or suspended facility. 
(4)  After consideration of the matter, the city council may revoke or suspend the pain medication license or allow the licensee to continue operating with the prescribing of schedule II substances for pain management clinics or dispensing of schedule II substances for non-exempt pharmacies, subject to any reasonable additional conditions deemed necessary to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects of such operation. 
(5)  Should the pain medication license be revoked, no reapplication for a pain medication license by the owners or operators shall be considered for any location within a 24-month period following the date of final revocation. After the expiration of the 24-month period, a new application and corresponding fee must be submitted. 
(c)  Renewal of pain medication license. Each pain medication license shall be required to be renewed no later than one year following the date of initial granting of the license. The annual renewal of any pain medication license shall be processed by the city manager or his/her designee and reviewed based upon the criteria of this article. If the city manager or his/her designee approves the renewal, the license shall be renewed upon payment of the nonrefundable annual fee in the amount of $200.00 per registered address. The amount of the renewal fee may be modified by resolution of the city council after a public hearing. If the city manager or his/her designee denies the renewal, the licensee shall have ten days from the date of the notice of denial to appeal the decision to the city council in accordance with section 12-152. The notice of appeal shall be timely submitted to the city manager and the city shall schedule a public hearing within 30 days of the receipt of the notice. The city council shall consider the appeal and make a decision with reasons stated using the provisions, terms and criteria set forth in this article. At the time of the requested license renewal, the city manager or his/her designee may, based on the criteria of subsection 12-153 recommend the imposition of additional conditions upon the pain medication licensee. If additional conditions are recommended by the city manager or his/her designee, the renewal shall be placed on the city council agenda for public hearing on the proposed imposition of additional conditions, in accordance with subsection 12-152. If a license is non-renewed or the council denies an appeal of the non-renewal, the owners and operators shall not be allowed to apply for a new pain medication license for a period of 24 months. In the event the city non-renews, revokes, or denies a pain medication license, the city reserves the right to contact the appropriate local, state and federal agencies for administrative or criminal action. 
(d)  Appeal procedure. Appeal of any city council decision regarding the issuance, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of pain medication license shall be to the circuit court, in the manner provided by state law. In accordance with state law, failure to appeal within 30 days of the rendition of the decision shall result in the applicant waiving his right to appeal. 
(e)  Transferability. A pain management license shall not be transferable. Any change in ownership shall require the new owner to reapply for a new license prior to the prescribing, storing or dispensing of schedule II substances.

Sec. 18-6. - Speculative building incentive plan. 
(a)  In order to create a more attractive market for the relocation, establishment or expansion of target industry and business to the City of St. Cloud, it is determined that an increase of certain types of building inventory is necessary. In order to accomplish said increase in these building inventories, the city may elect to offer deferral of impact fees and waiver of certain permit and inspection fees to developers willing to construct speculative buildings in the office, flex and industrial building categories. 
(b)  The minimum building criteria to qualify for this incentive plan is as follows: 
(i)  Office buildings must be built and designed as "class A" buildings. A "class A" office building is generally defined as a multi-story building constructed with concrete or masonry materials that is designed for corporate and professional use. To qualify for this plan, the building must be a minimum of 25,000 square feet in size. Except for common areas the building should be left in shell form to allow for custom client build-out. 
(ii)  Flex buildings are generally defined as a multi-use facility designed to accommodate light industrial, production and office. They should not be used for institutional uses such as places of religious worship, recreational uses such as gymnasiums or retail. To qualify for this plan, the building must be a minimum of 30,000 square feet in size, be constructed of concrete or masonry materials, contain a glass front and overhead doors in the rear, contain a minimum of two-hour fire-rated demising walls, a minimum 16-foot clear ceiling span and bay sizes of no less than 2,500 square feet.

The building should be left in shell form to accommodate custom client build-outs. 
(iv)  Requests for variances to land development code requirements for amenities such as landscaping and parking shall not be permitted if application for this plan has been made. 
(v)  In the event the owner/developer of the building is also a user/occupant of the building, the speculative portion of the building must be a minimum of 50 percent of the portion of the building that is being occupied by said owner developer. In no case shall the total size of the building be less than the minimum sizes stated above. 
(c)  The benefits of this speculative building plan are as follows: 
(1)  Transportation and public safety impact fees assessed by the city shall be paid by the developer at the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for space being leased to a business or industry occupying all or a portion of the building. Said fees shall be assessed based on the amount of square footage being occupied and continue to be assessed in this manner until the building is occupied in its entirety. In any case the impact fees on the entire building shall be paid by the developer within 18 months from the time a certificate of completion is issued for the building shell and site improvements. 
(2)  In order to reserve capacity during the concurrency review, water and sewer capacity reservation fees are due at the time as normally required by city council resolution. Speculative buildings meeting the requirements of this incentive plan shall pay 25 percent of the water and sewer reservation fees in effect at the time they are due. 
New construction that has a multi-meter building service shall be assessed at the full rate in effect at the time of the issuance of a water meter for that portion of the building being leased or occupied and served by said water meter. Impact fees related to each meter shall be assessed based upon the proposed use and current equivalent residential unit (ERU) calculation method approved by city council. Impact fees to be paid prior to the placement of the water meter shall be the impact fees assessed for the area served by said meter less a prorated (by square footage to be occupied and served by said meter) portion of the actual reservation fees previously paid. Remaining impact fees shall continue to be assessed in this manner until the building is occupied or served in its entirety. 
New construction that has a master meter shall be assessed at the full rate in effect at the time of the issuance of a water meter for the entire building being served by said water meter. Fees for the area served by the water meter shall be assessed based upon the proposed use and current equivalent residential unit (ERU) calculation method approved by city council. Impact fees to be paid prior to the placement of the water meter shall be the impact fees assessed for the area served by the meter less the reservation fees which were paid previously. 
Changes of use may alter the total impact fees due and may require submittal of an application for and issuance of a new certificate of capacity. In the event that additional impact fees are due as the result of the change in use, the balance of all water and sewer impact fees assessed by the city shall be paid at the rate in effect at the time of placement of the new water meter or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for commercial renovation not requiring a new or replacement water meter. 
(3)  Permit and inspection fees normally assessed by the city shall be waived on the building shell and the site improvements. Permit and inspection fees for tenant build-outs will be assessed by the city as normal. For an owner/occupant, this benefit shall be prorated and applicable only to that portion of the building/site not occupied by the owner.

Failure to adopt an annual assessment resolution during the budget adoption process may be cured at any time.

Sec. 37-14. - Effect of assessment resolutions. 
    The adoption of the final assessment resolution or of an annual assessment resolution requiring notice as provided in section 37-13 hereof, shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the apportionment methodology, the rate of assessment, the maximum annual assessment of each parcel, the adoption of the assessment roll and the levy and lien of the assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the city council's adoption of the final assessment resolution. The assessments for each fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the annual assessment resolution. If the assessments are to be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be certified to the tax collector. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21 , § 2, 4-9-2015) 
Sec. 37-15. - Prepayment of assessments. 
(a)  The assessment imposed against any parcel of property to fund capital improvements shall be subject to prepayment at the option of the property owner, as follows: 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of obligations, the assessment coordinator shall provide first class mailed notice to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment of the city council's intent to issue such obligations. On or prior to the date specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the 30th day following the date on which the notice is delivered to the possession of the U.S. Postal Service), or such later date as the city council may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total assessment obligation. 
(2)  Following the date specified in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 37-15(a) hereof, or such later date as the city council may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total remaining assessment upon payment of an amount equal to the sum of (a) such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding, (b) the premium associated with redemption of such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding, and (c) interest on such parcel's share of the principal amount of obligations then outstanding, from the most recent date to which interest has been paid to the next date following such prepayment on which the city can redeem obligations after providing all notices required by the ordinance or resolution authorizing issuance of such obligations; provided however, that during any period commencing on the date the annual assessment roll is certified for collection pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and ending on the next date on which unpaid ad valorem taxes become delinquent, the city may reduce the amount required to prepay the assessments imposed against any parcel of property by the amount of the assessment certified for collection with respect to such parcel. 
(b)  At the city's election, the assessment imposed against any parcel of property may be subject to acceleration and mandatory prepayment if at any time a tax certificate has been issued and remains outstanding in respect of such property. In such event, the amount required for mandatory prepayment shall be the same as that required for an optional prepayment authorized by subsection 37-15(a)(2) hereof. 
(c)  The amount of all prepayments computed in accordance with this section 37-15 shall be final. The city shall not be required to refund any portion of a prepayment if: 
(1)  The capital cost is less than the amount upon which such prepayment was computed, or 
(2)  Annual assessments will not be imposed for the full number of years anticipated at the time of such prepayment. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21 , § 2, 4-9-2015) 
Sec. 37-16. - Lien of assessments. 
(a)  Upon adoption of the final assessment resolution and the annual assessment resolution for each fiscal year, assessments to be collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid. The lien shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city council of the annual assessment resolution and shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes. 
(b)  Upon adoption of the final assessment resolution, assessments to be collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 37-17 hereof shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid. The lien shall be deemed perfected on the date notice thereof is recorded in the official records of Osceola County, Florida. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21 , § 2, 4-9-2015) 
Sec. 37-17. - Revisions to assessments. 
    If any assessment made under the provisions of this chapter is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city council is satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city council has omitted the inclusion of any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the city council may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any property benefited by the capital improvement or essential service, following as nearly as may be practicable the provisions of this chapter, and in case such second assessment is annulled, the city council may levy and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21 , § 2, 4-9-2015) 
Sec. 37-18. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under the provisions of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all proceedings related to such assessment were duly had, taken and performed as required by this chapter; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section 37-18, any party objecting to an assessment imposed pursuant to this chapter must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21 , § 2, 4-9-2015) 
Sec. 37-19. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the city council, assessment coordinator, property appraiser, tax collector, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of any assessment imposed by the city council under the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  The number of assessment units attributed to a parcel of property may be corrected at any time by the assessment coordinator. Any such correction which reduces an assessment shall be considered valid from the date on which the assessment was imposed and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this chapter. Any such correction which increases an assessment or imposes an assessment on omitted property shall first require notice to the affected owner at the address shown on the tax roll notifying the owner of the date, time and place that the city council will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard. 
(c)  When it shall appear that any assessment should have been imposed hereunder against a tax parcel specially benefited by the provision of capital improvements or essential services, but that such tax parcel was omitted from the assessment roll or was erroneously assessed, or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the final assessment resolution or the annual assessment resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the city council may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section 37-11 hereof, impose the applicable assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is discovered, in addition to the applicable assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. Such assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided herein, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(d)  The assessment coordinator shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any tax parcel subject to an assessment, based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, to correct any error in annually applying the assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of mailed notice pursuant to this chapter or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Additionally, because the size and nature of the tax roll may yield anomalies, the assessment coordinator is authorized to apply sound public administration judgment and delete or remove individual tax parcels from the assessment roll that due to specific circumstances do not receive a special benefit, are not developable (e.g., subsurface rights, submerged, slivers, right-of-way, common elements) or are reasonably determined to be inappropriate, infeasible or impracticable to assess, and do not merit the expenditure of public funds and resources to impose or collect such assessments. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the assessment coordinator and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(e)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to errors and insolvencies for ad valorem taxes.

ARTICLE III. - COLLECTION OF ASSESSMENTS 

Sec. 37-26. - Method of collection. 
    Unless directed otherwise by the city council, assessments (other than assessments imposed against government property) shall be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all applicable provisions thereof, including but not limited to: 
(1)  Entering into a written agreement with the property appraiser and the tax collector for reimbursement of necessary expenses; 
(2)  Certifying the assessment roll to the tax collector; and 
(3)  Adopting a resolution of intent after publishing weekly notice of such intent for four consecutive weeks preceding the hearing. 
    The resolution of intent may be adopted either prior to or following the initial assessment resolution; provided, however, that the resolution of intent must be adopted prior to January 1 (March 1 with consent of the property appraiser and tax collector) of the year in which the assessments are first collected on the ad valorem tax bill. This section shall not be construed to require adoption of an additional resolution of intent, and notice thereof, if a resolution of intent was previously adopted and is currently in effect for the area in question. Any hearing or notice required by this chapter may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21 , § 2, 4-9-2015) 
Sec. 37-27. - Alternative method of collection.

(1)  The city shall provide assessment bills by first-class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property, other than government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
a.  A brief explanation of the assessment; 
b.  A description of the assessment units used to determine the amount of the assessment; 
c.  The number of assessment units attributable to the parcel; 
d.  The total amount of the parcel's assessment for the appropriate period; 
e.  The location at which payment will be accepted; 
f.  The date on which the assessment is due; and 
g.  A statement that the assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the assessments shall be recorded in the official records of Osceola County, Florida. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The city shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent assessments in the manner provided by law. An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the due date. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of an assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent will initiate a foreclosure action and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, or otherwise as provided by law. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The city may join in one foreclosure action the collection of assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent property owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided, however, that: 
a.  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this chapter, and 
b.  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll to the tax collector.

Sec. 37-28. - Responsibility for enforcement. 
    The city and its agents, if any, shall maintain the duty to enforce the prompt collection of assessments by the means provided herein. The duties related to collection of assessments may be enforced at the suit of any holder of obligations in a court of competent jurisdiction by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings or actions. 
(Ord. No. 2015-21 , § 2, 4-9-2015) 
Sec. 37-29. - Government property. 
(a)  If assessments are imposed against government property, the city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(1)  A brief explanation of the assessment; 
(2)  A description of the assessment units used to determine the amount of the assessment; 
(3)  The number of assessment units attributable to the parcel; 
(4)  The total amount of the parcel's assessment for the appropriate period; 
(5)  The location at which payment will be accepted; and 
(6)  The date on which the assessment is due. 
(b)  Assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as assessments against other property within the assessment area and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c)  An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the due date. The city shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city or its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of, or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  As an alternative to the foregoing, an assessment imposed against government property may be collected on the bill for any utility service provided to such government property. The city council may also contract for such billing services with any utility not owned by the city.

At the option of the city council, the city may agree, by ordinance or resolution, to budget and appropriate funds to make up any deficiency in the reserve account established for the obligations or in the payment of the obligations, from other non-ad valorem revenue sources. The city council may also provide, by ordinance or resolution, for a pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue sources for the benefit of the holders of the obligations.

Said obligations shall mature not later than 40 years after their issuance. The city council shall determine by ordinance or resolution the form of the obligations, the manner of executing such obligations, and shall fix the denominations of such obligations, the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside of the State of Florida, and such other terms and provisions of the obligations as it deems appropriate. The obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the city council shall determine by ordinance or resolution. The obligations may be delivered to any contractor to pay for the provision of capital improvements or may be sold in such manner and for such price as the city council may determine by ordinance or resolution to be for the best interests of the city.

Sec. 37-41. - Taxing power not pledged. 
    Obligations issued under the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute a general obligation or pledge of the full faith and credit of the city within the meaning of the Constitution of the State of Florida, but such obligations shall be payable only from pledged revenue and, if applicable, proceeds of the assessments, in the manner provided herein and by the ordinance or resolution authorizing the obligations. The issuance of obligations under the provisions of this chapter shall not directly or indirectly obligate the city to levy or to pledge any form of ad valorem taxation whatsoever. No holder of any such obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the ad valorem taxing power on the part of the city to pay any such obligations or the interest thereon or to enforce payment of such obligations or the interest thereon against any property of the city, nor shall such obligations constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the city, except the pledged revenue.

Such refunding obligations may be issued in an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding obligations to be refunded.

If you show us a valid clerk's certificate showing that you have posted a bond, we must release your vehicle to you immediately.

The obligation for payment of impact fees shall run with the land, as shall the resulting privilege. 
(Code 1967, § 21-58; Code 1994, § 78-106; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-58(a), 12-19-1991; Ord. No. 98-39, § I, 1-28-1999; Ord. No. 2006-150, § I(78-106), 11-9-2006) 
Sec. 44-142. - Determination of fee. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the sewer impact fee shall be determined by the following: 
(1)  Residential and general service. 
a.  As a condition to providing offsite improvements for the sewer system, all residential land developments serviced by a three-quarter-inch meter shall be charged the amount adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time, and on file in the city clerk's office per equivalent residential unit (ERU), wherein one ERU equals 265 gallons per day (GPD) of wastewater flow. A residential land development serviced by a three-quarter-inch meter shall be considered to be equal to one ERU. 
b.  As a condition to providing offsite improvements for the sewer system, all residential land developments served by a meter size larger than three-quarters inch, and all general service land developments shall be charged the amount adopted by resolution of the city council, and on file in the city clerk's office per equivalent residential unit (ERU), wherein one ERU equals 265 gallons per day (GPD) of wastewater flow. The method of calculating the number of ERUs shall be based upon the estimated water flow as calculated by a meter size equivalency factor. The equivalent meter concept relates the flow for those meters larger than three-quarters inch to that of the volume of flow for a three-quarters-inch meter. The three-quarters-inch water meter size is the size most frequently used by the residential customer. A factor relates the non-three-quarters-inch meter to the three-quarters-inch meter flow as used in the potable water rate as follows: 
Meter Size Equivalency Factor 3/4? 1.00 1? 1.67 1&half? 3.33 2? 5.33 3? 10.00 4? 16.67 6? 33.33 8? 50.00 10? 133.33 12? 186.67 14? 250.00 16? 304.67  
Meter Size Equivalency Factor = ERUs 
The applicant may submit a written request for consideration of an alternate ERU calculation. Any such request must be accompanied by a sanitary sewer use estimate signed and sealed by a professional engineer. This alternative ERU calculation is subject to approval by the city manager or his designee. 
c.  The minimum impact fee for all residential land developments serviced by a water meter size larger than three-quarters inch and all general service land developments shall be one ERU per each unit. 
d.  Additions to existing residential or general service building. There shall be no additional impact fee due when application is made for a building permit to construct any addition to a single-family residential building served by a three-quarter inch meter. When application is made for a building permit to construct any addition to a residential building serviced by a meter size larger than three-quarters inch, or any general service building, which will increase the demand for sewer service to the building or structure already connected to the city sanitary system, impact fees for such addition shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for its construction, and sanitary sewer impact fees to be paid for such additions shall be calculated based on the total number of ERUs which are calculated by the formula in section (a)(1)b. of this section. 
(2)  Industrial users special provisions. Industrial users that are determined to be significant users, defined in section 44-31 and regulated by this article, may be required to pay additional impact fees as determined by the city manager. Such additional impact fees shall be designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards of service appropriate to the circumstances of the specific impact on the city sewerage system. 
(3)  Redevelopment or replacement. Where new development involves the redevelopment of land such that existing impact generating development is removed or substantially altered, the new development impact fees shall be computed on the additional or new impacts only. Impact fees shall be computed for the existing development and such sum shall then be subtracted from the impact fees calculated for the new development. The property shall receive an impact fee credit based on the number of equivalent residential units (ERU's). The ERU credit shall be equal to the greater of: 1) the number of (ERU's) assessed at time of original impact fee payment for the existing development, if available, or 2) the number of ERU's currently vested based upon the meter size in use or historically used at the property at any point the property was served by the city's sewer system. Prior use or credit information is subject to verification and approval by the city manager or his designee. It is the city's intent to collect impact fees for only that additional impact generated by redevelopment over and above the impact attributable to the existing development. 
(b)  Outside-the-city surcharge. In addition to the uniform sewer impact fees herein imposed, there is hereby imposed, on all outside-the-city off-site impact generating land development activity, a surcharge equal to 25 percent of such sewer impact fees, due, payable, and collectable in the same manner as that prescribed for the otherwise uniform sewer impact fees. 
(c)  Periodic review of sewer impact fee amounts. The city manager shall periodically review the fees adopted by resolution set forth in this section. The review period shall not exceed five years. 
(Code 1967, § 21-58; Code 1994, § 78-107; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-58(b), 12-19-1991; Ord. No. 92-V(b), 3-26-1992; Ord. No. 2003-05, § 1, 2-13-2003; Ord. No. 2006-150, § II(78-107), 11-9-2006; Ord. No. 2010-052, § 1, 12-9-2010) 
Sec. 44-143. - Properties using septic tanks when city sanitary sewer service is available. 
    Any property utilizing a septic tank system for sanitary sewer disposal despite the availability of city sanitary sewer service to such property shall not be required to connect to the city sanitary sewer system until such time as its septic tank system shall malfunction and require repair. At that time, no permit shall be issued for the performance of such repairs, and such property shall connect to the city sanitary sewer system. 
(Code 1967, § 21-59; Code 1994, § 78-108; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-59, 12-19-1991) 
Sec. 44-144. - Alternative impact fee calculation authorized for significant industrial users. 
    If an applicant believes that the cost of improvements needed to serve his industrial development is less than the fee established under this division, the applicant may submit an alternative fee calculation to the city manager pursuant to the provisions of section 44-145. If the city manager finds that the data, information, assumptions, formulae and methodology used by the applicant to calculate the alternative impact fee satisfy the subject requirements, the alternative impact fee shall be deemed the impact fee due and owing for the proposed development. 
(Code 1967, § 21-60; Code 1994, § 78-109; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-60, 12-19-1991) 
Sec. 44-145. - Procedure for review of alternative impact fee calculation for significant industrial users. 
(a)  Alternate calculations. The alternative impact fee calculation shall be based on data, information, assumptions, formulae, and methodology contained in this division and the studies prepared by independent sources, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is accepted standard source of engineering and planning data or information; 
(2)  The independent source is a local study carried out by a qualified planner or engineer pursuant to an accepted methodology of planning or engineering; or 
(3)  Where different data, information, assumptions, formulae, or methodology are employed, such differences shall be specifically identified and justified. 
(b)  Submission. An alternative impact fee calculation shall be undertaken through the submission of an application for review of an alternative impact fee calculation for the impact fee component for which an alternative impact fee calculation is requested. 
(c)  City manager determination. Within 20 days of receipt of an application for review of an alternative impact fee calculation, the city manager shall determine if the application is complete. If the city manager determines that the application is not complete, he shall send a written statement specifying the deficiencies by mail to the person submitting the application. The application shall be deemed complete if no deficiencies are specified. The city manager shall take no further action on the application until it is deemed complete. 
(d)  City manager review. When the city manager determines the application is complete, he shall review it and render a written decision in 30 days on whether the fee should be modified, and if so, what the amount should be. 
(e)  Adjustment by agreement. If the city manager finds that the data, information, assumptions, formulae and/or methodology used by the applicant to compute the alternative impact fee calculation satisfies the requirements of this division, the fee determined in the alternative impact fee calculation shall be deemed the fee due and owing for the proposed land development activity. This adjustment in the fee shall be set forth in a fee agreement which shall be entered into pursuant to section 44-146(b). 
(f)  Appeal. A determination by the city manager that the alternative impact fee calculation does not satisfy the requirements of this section may be appealed to the city council. 
(Code 1967, § 21-61; Code 1994, § 78-110; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-61, 12-19-1991) 
Sec. 44-146. - Presumption, agreement and security requirements. 
(a)  Maximum sewer impact generated. The proposed development shall be presumed to generate the maximum impact generated by the development in accordance with the approved site plan and/or requested building permits. 
(b)  Special sewer impact fee agreement. In lieu of the payment of fees as calculated in section 44-142, any applicant may propose to enter into an impact agreement with the city designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards of service appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development proposed. Such an agreement shall include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which: 
(1)  Modify the presumption of maximum impact set forth in subsection (a) of this section, and provide an impact fee which may differ from that set forth in section 44-142, by specifying the nature of the proposed development for the purposes of computing actual impact, provided that the agreement shall establish legally enforceable means for ensuring that the impact will not exceed the impact generated by the agreed upon development. 
(2)  Permit the construction of specific improvements in lieu of, or with a credit against, the impact fees component developer to recover the actual cost of such improvements in excess of the amount, which would have been assessed under this division. 
(3)  Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this subsection (b) shall, with formal public hearing and after recommendation by the planning commission, be presented to and approved by the city council prior to the issuance of a building permit. Any such agreement may provide for execution by mortgagees, lienholders or contract purchasers in addition to the landowner, and may permit any party to record such agreement in the official records of the county. The city council shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner, consistent with the principal of rational nexus as set forth in state law. 
(c)  Homestead installment payments. For any property designated as a homestead under F.S. ch. 222, the city council may permit the sewer impact fee to be paid by installments in lieu of the fee payment requirements in section 44-142, as the particular circumstances shall dictate. Evidence of the debt due, reflecting the payment terms, together with evidence of a marketable lien encumbering the property served, shall be executed in recordable form and the evidence of lien together with a copy of the evidence of debt shall be filed in the public records of the county. 
(Code 1994, § 78-111; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-62, 12-19-1991; Ord. No. 2003-05, § 2, 2-13-2003) 
Sec. 44-147. - Credits. 
(a)  Generally. An applicant shall be entitled to a credit against any sewer impact fee component assessed in an amount equal to the cost of off-site improvements contributed or previously contributed, paid for or committed to by the applicant or his predecessor in interest as a condition of any development permit required and/or issued by the city for the same development or for excess collection or transmission capacity constructed by the applicant or his predecessor in interest where such excess capacity is constructed at the request of the city and credit for same is agreed to by the city in advance of the creation of the excess capacity and provided for in an impact fee agreement. On-site facilities constructed for reclaimed wastewater distribution and disposal may be considered for a credit. The cost of such improvements shall be based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The actual cost, or estimated cost of the improvements based on recent bid information of the city; and 
(2)  Average cost determination, as set forth in the city sanitary sewer impact fee methodology. 
Improvements required by previous development permits shall not be given a credit unless they meet the requirements of this subsection. 
(b)  Credit nontransferable. Credit for contributions, payments, construction or dedications of any impact fee component shall not be transferable to another component. Credit shall be transferable only within the same component and within the same development. 
(c)  Credit application. The credit determination shall be made by the city manager upon application. The application shall include: 
(1)  A drawing of the contributed or to be contributed improvement prepared by an engineer registered by the state showing his seal. 
(2)  An appraisal of the contributed or to be contributed land fixing value of the land as of the date of issuance of earliest building permit, actual contribution or agreement to contribute, whichever is earliest. 
(3)  The actual cost, with appropriate documentation, or projected cost, with appropriate documentation, of any improvement contributed or to be constructed and contributed. 
(d)  Credit agreement. If the application for credit is approved by the city manager a credit agreement shall be prepared and signed by the applicant and the city. It shall specifically outline the contribution, payment, construction or land dedication, the time by which it shall be completed, dedicated, or paid, and any extensions thereof, and the dollar credit the applicant shall receive for the contribution, payment, construction or land. 
(e)  Appeal. A determination by the city manager as to an application for credit may be appealed to the city council. 
(Code 1994, § 78-112; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-63, 12-19-1991) 
Sec. 44-148. - Impact fee revenue restrictions; return of unused funds. 
(a)  Sewer fund restricted account-impact fee. All sanitary sewer impact fees collected shall be held in a trust fund known as the sewer fund restricted account-impact fee. Funds may be appropriated from this trust fund only by the city council upon its determination that the proposed expenditure is for the expansion of the system, as below provided. Any improvement which directly or indirectly is associated with expansion may be determined by the city council, at their sole discretion, to be an expansion of the system, and nothing herein contained shall prohibit same. 
(b)  Identification of funds to meet deficiency. When the city council determines that the purpose of a proposed capital improvement, in whole or part, is to overcome a deficiency not attributable to new growth and development, the city manager shall identify sources of funds to meet such deficiency proportion of the improvement for city council approval prior to the utilization of any impact fees. 
(c)  Fund use, limitation. The collected impact fees shall be used solely for the purpose of acquisition, expansion and development of the capital assets, including debt service determined to be needed to serve new development, to include the principal and interest of loans or parts of loans. 
(d)  Refund. All funds derived from sewer impact fees shall be expended on a first-in, first-out basis. Any such funds, not expended within seven years of their collection date, upon the generating property's then owner's timely application, shall be refunded to such owner. To be timely an application shall be received by the city manager within eight years of the subject collection date. No fee refund shall be made without timely application, and any funds remaining more than eight years after collection shall be deemed abandoned. With his annual budget to the city council, the city manager shall make report as to abandoned sewer impact funds and recommend appropriation improving sanitary sewer service. 
(Code 1994, § 78-113; Code 1967, § 21-62; Ord. No. 91-H-2, § 21-64, 12-19-1991) 
Sec. 44-149. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempted from the payment of impact fees to the extent there is no increase in impact associated with the property or use: 
(1)  Minor alterations. Alteration or minor expansions of an existing structure where the use, number of housing units, or number of fixture units in the case of nonresidential construction is not changed. 
(2)  Accessory building. The construction of an accessory building or structures. 
(3)  Replacement. A replacement of a building or structure with a new building or structure of the same use provided that no additional impact to the sanitary sewer system is created by such replacement.

DIVISION 6. - USE REGULATIONS 

Sec. 44-171. - General discharge prohibitions. 
(a)  No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed directly or indirectly any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of the POTW, whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(1)  Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or quantity, are or may be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system), be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides, and any other substances which the city, the state or the EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. 
(2)  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to, grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residue, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes. 
(3)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0, unless POTW was specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitations set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the act. 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for their maintenance and repair. 
(6)  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
(7)  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards. 
(8)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(9)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). 
(10)  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or qualities of pollutants that exceed, for any time period longer than 15 minutes, more than five times the average 24-hour concentrations, quantities or flow during normal operation. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the city manager in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
(b)  When the city manager determines that a user is contributing to the POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the city manager shall: 
(1)  Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and 
(2)  Develop an effluent limitation for such user to correct the interference with the POTW. 
(Code 1967, § 21-16; Code 1994, § 78-126) 
Sec. 44-172. - Federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
    Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The city manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. 
(Code 1967, § 21-17; Code 1994, § 78-127) 
Sec. 44-173. - Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
    Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2), "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the act. The city may modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(Code 1967, § 21-18; Code 1994, § 78-128) 
Sec. 44-174. - Pollutant limitations. 
    Minimum criteria for discharge of pollutants and limitations of such discharge shall be the same as the criteria for all waters at all times and all places within the state and listed under Water Quality Standards, F.A.C. ch. 62-3 of the rules of the department of environmental protection titled "Water Quality Standards," and F.A.C. ch. 62-600 et seq., "Wastewater Facilities." Specific limitations of above standards are listed below. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the below-listed specific pollutant limitations:

(Code 1967, § 21-19; Code 1994, § 78-129) 
Sec. 44-175. - State requirements. 
    Revised state requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. 
(Code 1967, § 21-20; Code 1994, § 78-130) 
Sec. 44-176. - City's right of revision. 
    The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in this article. 
(Code 1967, § 21-21; Code 1994, § 78-131) 
Sec. 44-177. - Excessive discharge, diluted discharge. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. (Comment: Dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth in section 44-171(a)(3), the pH prohibition.) 
(Code 1967, § 21-22; Code 1994, § 78-132) 
Sec. 44-178. - Accidental discharges. 
(a)  Responsibility. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by January 1, 1986. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. 
(b)  Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(c)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Code 1967, § 21-23; Code 1994, § 78-133) 
Sec. 44-179. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  The city shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(c)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city. 
(Code 1967, § 21-84; Code 1994, § 78-134) 
Sec. 44-180. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, the approval authority and (where the NPDES state is the approval authority) the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, the approval authority and the EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(Code 1967, § 21-85; Code 1994, § 78-135) 
Sec. 44-181. - Pretreatment. 
(a)  Required. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.

(b)  Determination of fee. Except as otherwise provided herein, the potable water impact fee shall be determined by the following: 
(1)  Residential and general service. 
a.  As a condition to providing offsite improvements for the potable water system, all residential land developments serviced by a three-quarter-inch meter shall be charged the amount approved by resolution of the city council, and on file in the city clerk's office per equivalent residential unit (ERU), wherein one ERU equals 300 gallons per day (GPD) of potable water flow. A residential land development serviced by a three-quarter-inch meter shall be considered to be equal to one ERU. Meter size shall be in accordance with AWWA recommended standards. 
b.  As a condition to providing offsite improvements for the potable water system all residential land developments served by a meter size larger than three-quarter inch, and all general service land developments shall be charged the amount as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time per equivalent residential unit (ERU), wherein on ERU equals 300 gallons per day (GPD) of potable water flow. The method of calculating the number of ERUs shall be based upon the estimated water flow as calculated by a meter size equivalency factor. The equivalent meter concept relates the flow for those meters larger than three-quarters inch to that of the volume of flow for a three-quarters-inch meter. The three-quarters-inch water meter size is the size most frequently used by the residential customer. A factor relates the non-three-quarters-inch meter to the three-quarters-inch meter flow as used in the potable water utility rate structure. 
Meter Size Equivalency Factor 3/4? 1.00 1? 1.67 1&half? 3.33 2? 5.33 3? 10.00 4? 16.67 6? 33.33 8? 50.00 10? 133.33 12? 186.67 14? 250.00 16? 304.67  
Meter Size Equivalency Factor = ERUs 
The applicant may submit a written request for consideration of an alternate ERU calculation or meter size. Any such request must be accompanied by a water use estimate that is signed and sealed by a professional engineer. This alternative ERU calculation is subject to approval by the city manager or his designee. 
c.  The minimum impact fee for all residential land developments serviced by a water meter sizes larger than three-quarters inch and all general service land developments shall be one ERU per each unit. 
d.  Additions to existing residential or general service building. There shall be no additional impact fee due when application is made for a building permit to construct any addition to a single-family residential building serviced by a three-quarter-inch meter. When application is made for a building permit to construct any addition to a residential building serviced by a meter size larger than three-quarters inch, or any general service building which will increase the demand for water service to the building or structure already connected to the city potable water system, impact fees for such addition shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for its construction, and potable water impact fees to be paid for such additions shall be calculated based on the total number of ERUs which are calculated using the formula described in (b.) above. 
(2)  Industrial users special provisions. Industrial users that are determined to be significant industrial potable water users may be required to pay potable water impact fees as may be established by the city manager, guided by industry standards, toward the goal of just and equitable fees. No fee less than the fee required of a general service user, but for this provision, shall be set until approved by the city council, and no fee more than the fee required of a general service user, but for this provision, shall be set until approved by the user. In the event of any dispute in the latter case, the city council shall be the final authority. 
(3)  Redevelopment or replacement. Where new development involves the redevelopment of land such that existing impact generating development is removed or substantially altered, the new development impact fees shall be computed on the additional or new impacts only. Impact fees shall be computed for the existing development and such sum shall then be subtracted from the impact fees calculated for the new development. The property shall receive an impact fee credit based on the number of equivalent residential units (ERU's). The ERU credit shall be equal to the greater of: 1) number of (ERUs) assessed at time of original impact fee payment for the existing development, if available; or 
a.  The number of ERU's currently vested based upon the meter size in use or historically used at the property at any point the property was served by the city's potable water system. Prior use or credit information is subject to verification and approval by the city manager or his designee. It is the city's intent to collect impact fees for only that additional impact generated by redevelopment over and above the impact attributable to the existing development. 
b.  Outside-the-city surcharge. In addition to the uniform potable water impact fees herein imposed, there is hereby imposed, on all outside-the-city off-site impact generating land development activity, a surcharge equal to 25 percent of such uniform potable water impact fees, due, payable, and collectable in the same manner as that prescribed for the otherwise uniform potable water impact fees. 
(c)  Periodic review of water impact fee amounts. The city manager shall periodically review the fees adopted by resolution as set forth in this section. The review period shall not exceed five years.

(1)  Railroads; 
(2)  Public roads (including federal, state, county and city); 
(3)  Public airport taxiways and runways; and 
(4)  Open water. 
(b)  Credits. 
(1)  The city recognizes that some customers subject to the utility fee have on their property constructed and currently operate and maintain stormwater facilities that can reduce stormwater runoff impacts from the subject property and reduce the burden on the city to maintain, operate and provide capital improvements to the system. Additionally, the city recognizes that some customers may wish to mitigate the utility fee by constructing and maintaining a stormwater facility that will reduce the impact of the subject property. The credit granted shall conform to the procedures and as defined by the stormwater administrative policy manual. 
(2)  To qualify for the fee credit, a utility customer must operate a stormwater facility and must provide certification by a state registered professional engineer that the facility is operating as designed and is regularly maintained. Further, the engineer must certify that the subject stormwater facility must exceed the minimum requirements of the current land development regulations of the city or for the additional credit, that the facility accepts a measurable amount of off-site stormwater. 
(3)  The utility customer requesting the credit must demonstrate to the city on or before every second year anniversary after the granting of the credit that the stormwater facilities are operating properly and being maintained according to standard practices. The stormwater facility must be certified by a state registered professional engineer that the facility is operating as designed and is regularly maintained according to standard practices. 
(4)  After a particular customer receives a utility fee credit, annually thereafter the city may inspect the stormwater drainage facilities serving the site in order to determine whether those facilities are maintained and functioning properly. If the city inspection determines that they are maintained and functioning property, the stormwater drainage utility fee credit shall be continued. However, if the city inspection determines that the system is improperly maintained and not functioning properly, the city shall notify the customer to correct the deficiency within 30 days.

A density of 0.25 shall be interpreted to mean 25 percent. Density (floor area) on sites greater than ten acres in size shall be calculated by dividing the largest area of the site having not less than 50 percent net usable area and multiplying this area by the lot coverage limits established within the zoning district.

    Density, residential. Refers to the number of residential units permitted per acre of land and is determined by dividing the number of proposed units by the net usable area of the lot or parcel. Net usable area does not include any right-of-way or floodprone preservation areas except as provided for below. In determining the number of residential units to be permitted, any fractional unit shall not entitle the developer to an additional unit. 
a.  Formula. The formula for calculating density shall be as follows: Lands above the 100-year flood elevation shall be multiplied by the maximum density allowed for the site; lands below the 100-year flood elevation, hereinafter referred to as flood prone elevation (F.P.E.), shall be multiplied by one-fourth the maximum density allowed for the site. The total number of units allowed for acreage above the F.P.E. is then added to the total number of units allowed for the acreage below the F.P.E. (The latter amount of units shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of units permitted for acreage above the F.P.E.) 
b.  Example: 
Given: A nine-acre parcel. Two acres are below the F.P.E. The zoning classification is R-3 and a maximum of 12 units per acre is allowed. 
Solution: 
1.  9 acres - 2 acres = 7 acres above the F.P.E. 
2.  7 acres × 12 units/acre = 84 units above the F.P.E. 
3.  2 acres × (12 units/acre × 1/4)= 6 units below the F.P.E. 
4.  Twenty-five percent of 84 units = 21 units. 
5.  Six units is therefore less than 25 percent of total units above the F.P.E. 
6.  Eighty-four units (above the F.P.E.) + 6 units (below the F.P.E.) = 90 allowable units. 
    Dependent travel trailer. A trailer not having a toilet and bathtub or shower, or any trailer not providing a plumbing system suitable for connection to the park sewerage system.

A Agricultural District HPO Historic Preservation Overlay District  
3.2.3. - Districts shown on maps. 
    The boundaries of the various districts are shown upon an official zoning map. The official zoning map is hereby made a part of this code and all maps, references, and other information shown therein shall be as much a part of this code as if all matter and information set forth by said maps were fully described herein. 
A.  Official zoning map. If, in accordance with the provisions of these zoning regulations and applicable provisions of state law, changes are made in district boundaries or other matters portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be entered promptly on the official zoning map after the amendment has been approved by the city council. All entries on the official zoning map shall be noted within a legend of "map changes." The legend shall include ordinance number, date of adoption, applicant name, existing zoning and new zoning. 
B.  Unauthorized changes prohibited. No changes of a nature which would alter the assigned district boundaries shall be made in the official zoning map, or any matter shown thereon, except in conformity with the procedures set out in these zoning regulations. Any unauthorized change in the assigned districts by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of these zoning regulations. Changes which affect the identification of physical features of the city, such as streets, lots, or waterways, may be made on the official zoning map providing such change is authorized in writing by the city manager. 
C.  Final authority as to zoning. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of all or part of the official zoning map, which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map, which shall be maintained by the office of the city manager or his designee shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of all lands and waters in the incorporated area of the city. 
D.  Retention of earlier zoning map. All zoning maps, or remaining portions thereof, which have been officially adopted and recognized as the official zoning map for the city prior to the effective date of adoption of these zoning regulations shall be retained as a public record and as a guide to the zoning status of lands and waters prior to such date. 
E.  Replacement of official zoning map. If the official zoning map, or any page or portion thereof, becomes damaged, lost, destroyed, or difficult to interpret by reason of the nature or number of changes, the city council may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning map, or any page or pages thereof, which shall supersede the prior official zoning map, or page or pages thereof. The new official zoning map, or page or pages thereof, may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, or page or pages thereof, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map, or page or pages thereof. If, in the process of adopting a replacement official zoning map, or any page or pages thereof, district boundaries are changed or altered, then action in regard to such change of district boundaries shall be taken only in the form of an amendment in conformity with these zoning regulations. 
3.2.4. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
    Except as otherwise specifically provided, a district symbol or name shown within district boundaries on the official zoning map indicates that district regulations pertaining to the district extend throughout the whole area surrounded by the boundary line. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on said maps, the following rules shall apply: 
A.  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following street and alley lines, land lot lines, or lot lines, such line shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
B.  In unsubdivided property or tracts, where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on such maps. 
C.  Where a public road, street, or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it is reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road, street, or alley. 
3.2.5. - Application of district regulations. 
    The regulations herein set out within each district shall be minimum or maximum limitations, as the case may be, and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure, use, or land or water. Except as hereinafter provided: 
A.  Zoning affects use or occupancy. No building, structure or part thereof, land, or water shall hereafter be used or occupied, erected, constructed, reconstructed, located, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified. 
B.  Zoning affects height of structures, population density, lot coverage, yards, and open spaces. No building or structure shall hereafter be erected or altered in any manner contrary to the provisions of these zoning regulations, and especially: 
1.  To exceed height, floor area ratios, or building area; 
2.  To provide a greater number of dwelling units; 
3.  To provide less lot area per dwelling unit or to occupy a smaller lot; 
4.  To occupy a greater percentage of lot area; 
5.  To provide narrower or smaller yards, courts, or other open spaces; or 
6.  To provide for lesser separation between buildings or structures or portions of buildings or structures. 
C.  Multiple use of required open space prohibited. No part of a required yard or other required open space, required off-street parking, or off-street loading space, provided in connection with one building, structure, or use shall be included as meeting the requirements for any other building, structure, or use, except where specific provision is made in these zoning regulations. 
D.  Reduction of lot area prohibited. No lot or yard existing at the effective date of these zoning regulations shall thereafter be reduced in size, dimension, or area below the minimum requirements set out herein, except by reason of a portion being acquired for public use by dedication, condemnation, or purchase. Lots or yards created after the effective date of these zoning regulations shall meet at least the minimum requirements established herein. 
E.  Continuity of zoning. In the event any unincorporated territory shall hereafter become incorporated, there shall be no lapse of zoning. Any and all zoning regulations which may be in effect in such territory shall remain in full force and effect and shall continue to be administered and enforced until such time as municipal zoning within such territory shall be adopted and take effect. 
F.  Effect on lots. Every building or structure hereafter erected shall be located on a lot as defined herein. When an unrecorded lot or nonunified parcel of land is used, the owner thereof shall furnish the city manager or his designee a statement of unity of title, allocating to such uses a specific area of land, the unity of which shall not be subject to further subdivision and shall furnish proof of legal access thereto. Unity of title shall be accomplished by providing to the city an individual parcel number, obtained from the property appraiser's office, for the parcel of land being used. Uses, area, and yard requirements for such unrecorded lots or nonunified parcels shall be the same as for lots of record located in the same district.

Public hearing requirements shall be as shown in sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5 of this code. 
b.  Factual matters. The application shall address the factual matters below listed, which shall be considered of equal weight. These factual matters shall be considered by the planning commission in making its recommendation to the city council, and by the city council in granting approval.

(5)  Is the conditional use consistent with the city's comprehensive plan; 
(6)  Can the conditional use development be designed to function effectively for its intended purpose without creating negative off-site impacts for adjoining parcels. 
c.  Finding of the city council. Before any conditional use is granted, the city council shall make a finding, based upon the consideration of the above-listed factual matters stated as questions, that the granting of the conditional use will not adversely affect the public interest, but rather will promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. Such finding shall be made if all of the above listed factual matters, stated as questions, are answered in the affirmative, but if not the conditional use application shall be denied. 
d.  Special requirement guidelines. Upon a finding that the conditional use will not adversely effect the public interest, the city council shall review all suggested specific requirements for the individual conditional use and shall establish the requirements based upon professional urban planning and municipal engineering standards, methods and techniques, in regard to the following specific requirement guidelines:

Any conditional use granted by the city council shall expire 12 months after the effective date of such action by the city council unless any required occupational license or building permit based upon and incorporating the conditional use is obtained within the aforesaid 12-month period. However, the city council, generally, may renew such conditional use for one additional period of six months provided good cause is shown and provided the application for extension is filed with the city manager or his designee at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the aforesaid 12-month period. Any renewal may be granted without public hearing; however, a reapplication fee shall be collected for any renewal in an amount not to exceed the amount of the original application fee.

Once changed to a permitted use, the previous conditional use shall not be reinstated without the procedure outlined for conditional uses. Public hearing requirements shall be as shown in sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5 of this code. 
g.  Permitted use deleted from code. A particular granted permitted use shall not thereafter become a nonconforming use, solely by virtue of a code amendment, if following the code amendment such use continues to be a use permitted as a conditional use; but rather such use shall continue as if granted a conditional use.

3.7.1. - Description of districts. 
    These districts comprise certain lands, water, and structures having a low density of development; they are single-family residential in character and have additional open space where it is desirable and likely that such similar development will occur and continue. Uses are limited primarily to single-family dwellings and such nonresidential uses as are intended to provide service to the immediate and adjacent areas. 
3.7.2. - Density. 
    No residential project within any residential district shall be approved at a density which exceeds the maximum allowable density for the land use category in which the property is located, and the capacity of water, sewer or traffic circulation systems serving the site, taking into account other existing and approved project demands regardless of the size or configuration of the lots proposed for the development. (Ord. No. 95-29, 7-13-1995) 
DIVISION 8. - R-2 ZONE, SINGLE-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT, ND R-2A ZONE, SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT 

3.8.1. - Description of district. 
    The R-2 zone is composed of certain areas intended to provide more intensive land use than single-family districts. Provision is made for the erection of duplex dwelling structures but no multifamily structures. These districts are situated so that they are well served by public and commercial services and have convenient access to thoroughfares and collector streets. 
    The R-2A zone is composed of certain areas intended to allow an increase in density by allowing smaller lots but limiting the uses to single-family residences. (Ord. No. 99-19, 4-22-1999) 
3.8.2. - Density regulations. 
    No residential project within any residential district shall be approved at a density which exceeds the maximum allowable density for the land use category in which the property is located, and the capacity of water, sewer or traffic circulation systems serving the site, taking into account other existing and approved project demands regardless of the size or configuration of the lots proposed for the development. (Ord. No. 95-29, 7-13-1995) 
DIVISION 9. - R-3 AND R-4 MULTIPLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICTS 

3.9.1. - Description of districts. 
    These districts are composed of certain medium and high density residential areas, plus open space and recreation areas required to service such density, where it is likely and desirable to extend such type of development as identified in the city comprehensive plan. These districts may also serve as a mitigation district for those lands which restrict development activity because of particular conservation concerns as identified in the city comprehensive plan. Due to the higher than average concentration of persons and vehicles, these districts are situated where it is well serviced by public and commercial services. Also included in this district are architecturally integrated subdivisions, townhouses, cluster subdivisions and condominium projects. (Ord. No. 2001-40, 9-27-2001; Ord. No. 2013-01, §1, 1-24-2013) 
3.9.2. - Density regulations. 
    Maximum density shall be set at the time of zoning; however, in no case shall the maximum density for R-3 exceed ten dwelling units per net residential acre. 
    In no case shall the maximum density for R-4 exceed 18 dwelling units per net residential acre. 
    No rezoning, or project within the R-3 or R-4 districts shall be approved at any density which exceeds the capacity of water, sewer or traffic circulation systems serving the site, taking into account existing and approved project demands, or the ability of the city police and fire departments to adequately provide service demands of the density. 
3.9.3. - General provisions and exceptions. 
    Permitted accessory uses and structures for single-family, two-family (duplex) and cluster subdivision structures within the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts shall meet the requirements under 3.5.1, "General provisions for residential zoning districts." 
    Permitted accessory uses and structures for multifamily, condominium projects, townhouses or architecturally integrated subdivision units shall be designed exclusively for the use of the complex residents and shall, except for carports and/or garages, be located within the complex and not on the perimeter.

3.9.5. - Maximum lot coverage. 
    Maximum lot coverage for all uses within the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts shall be 35 percent. 
3.9.6. - Maximum building or structure height. 
    Any building or structure may exceed 35 feet in height in the R-3 and R-4 zoning districts providing the following conditions are met: 
A.  Adequate fire protection is provided by internal fire abatement systems being constructed and such fire protection must be verified by the city manager or his designee. 
B.  Adequate water supply and pressure are provided on the site and approved by the city manager or his designee. 
3.9.7. - Minimum open space. 
    Such common open space must be reasonably compact and at least one open space area shall provide usable area for the purposes of informal and unstructured recreation and relaxation. Retention areas, provided they are constructed and maintained to provide for recreation access, may also be used in the calculation of this requirement. 
A.  Generally. Single-family and two-family (duplex) in standard subdivision shall not require additional open space. 
B.  Cluster subdivisions. Common open space, miniparks, and/or greenbelts shall be provided within the subdivision in the amount equivalent to 500 square feet per buildable lot of useable recreation and open space. The amount of useable open space that must be set aside shall be:

1.  Common open space for areas developed for nondwelling purposes shall provide 15 percent of the gross land area of the project for useable open space. 
3.9.8. - Architecturally integrated subdivision provisions. 
    The intent of architecturally integrated subdivisions is to allow the developer to create lots and construct buildings without regard to any minimum lot size, lot width, or setback restrictions, except for those noted below and in which approval is obtained, not only for the division of land into lots but also for a configuration of principle buildings to be located on such lots. Architecturally integrated subdivisions require that the approved plans show the location, height, and minimum dimensions of all structures to the extent necessary to comply with the purpose and intent of architecturally integrated subdivisions. This subdivision type is essentially for the subdivision of buildings, rather than the subdivision of land, and allows for "fee simple" ownership of such buildings. 
A.  Within architecturally integrated subdivisions, the following standards shall apply: 
1.  Lot boundary setback requirements shall apply where and to the extent that structures constructed on the subdivided tracts meet setback requirements set forth in section 3.9.4 above, to abutting lands not a part of the architecturally integrated subdivision. 
2.  All units within an architecturally integrated subdivision shall access a main collector or arterial roadway by a street within the architecturally integrated subdivision. 
3.  Each lot must be of sufficient size and dimension that it can accommodate the structure proposed to be located on it consistent with all other applicable requirements of this section. 
4.  The number of dwelling units in an architecturally integrated subdivision cannot exceed the maximum density authorized for the tract under section 3.9.2 of these regulations. 
5.  To the extent reasonably practicable in residential subdivisions, the amount of land "saved" by creating lots that are smaller than the standards set forth above, shall be set aside as usable open space. (See section 3.9.7 for specific requirements.) 
6.  The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility, consistent with the public health and safety, and not to increase overall density to the developer that subdivides property and constructs buildings on the lots created in accordance with the unified and coherent plan of development. 
7.  Architecturally integrated subdivisions are required to apply for subdivision approval as specified in subdivision regulations, article V of the land development code. 
8.  Necessary legal mechanisms need to be recorded with the subdivision to ensure: 
a.  Ownership and proper maintenance of common areas. 
b.  Architectural integrity of the buildings/structures remain intact with the original plan of development. 
9.  Landscaping and buffers are required as set forth in landscaping, article VIII of these regulations. 
3.9.9. - Cluster subdivision provisions. 
    The intent of cluster subdivisions is to allow the subdivision of smaller lots provided the developer leaves the land "saved" by so doing as usable open space, thereby lowering development costs and increasing the amenity of the project. 
A.  Within cluster subdivisions, in the R-3 zoning district, the following standards shall apply: 
1.  In any cluster subdivision, the developer may create lots and construct buildings provided such lots shall be a minimum of 6,000 square feet and all other zoning restrictions for single-family structures are met. The land area saved by clustering shall be incorporated into usable recreation and open space and comprise at least 10,000 square feet of unified usable space. 
2.  The number of dwelling units in a cluster subdivision shall not exceed the maximum density authorized for the tract under section 3.9.2 of these regulations. 
3.  Cluster subdivisions are required to apply for subdivision approval as specified in subdivision regulations, article V of these regulations. 
B.  Within cluster subdivisions, in the R-4 zoning district, the following standards shall apply: 
In any single-family residential subdivision in the R-4 zone, a developer may create lots that are smaller than those required in a standard subdivision, provided that: 
1.  The lots created shall be a minimum of 5,000 square feet and all other zoning restrictions for single-family structures are met. 
2.  The number of dwelling units does not exceed the maximum density authorized for the tract under section 3.9.2. 
3.  The amount of usable open space that must be set aside shall be as referenced in section 3.9.6. 
4.  Setback and yard requirements shall be as set forth in Table III-4. 
3.9.10. - Deed covenants and recorded condominium documents. 
    Within condominium and townhouse projects, deed covenants and all recorded condominium documents as required by the state shall be required and filed with the general services department prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy to ensure the maintenance and upkeep of areas and facilities retained in common ownership in order to provide a safe, healthful, and attractive living environment and to prevent the occurrence of blight and deterioration of the individual units within the complex.

Entrances and exits to travel trailer parks and campgrounds shall be designed for safe and convenient movement of traffic into and out of the park, and to minimize marginal friction with free movement of traffic on adjacent streets. All traffic into or out of the park shall be through such entrances and exits. No entrance or exit shall require a turn at an acute angle for vehicles moving in the direction intended, and radii of curbs and pavements at intersections shall be such as to facilitate easy turning movements for vehicles with trailers attached. No material impediment to visibility shall be created or maintained which obscured the view of an approaching driver in the right lane of the street within: (a) 100 feet where speed limit is less than 45 miles per hour, or (b) 150 feet where speed limit is 45 miles per hour or more, of any portion of the approach lane of the access way within 25 feet of its intersection with the righthand lane of the street. 
L.  Off-street parking, loading and maneuvering space. In connection with use of any travel trailer park or campground, no parking, loading, or maneuvering incidental to parking or loading shall be permitted on any public street, sidewalk, required buffer, or right-of-way, or on any public grounds, or on any private grounds not part of the travel trailer park, unless the owner has given written permission for such use. Each travel trailer park shall provide off-street parking, loading and maneuvering space located and scaled so that the prohibitions above may be observed, and park owners shall be held responsible for violations of these requirements. 
M.  Procedures. Applications for rezoning to MH-2 classification for travel trailer park or campground purposes shall present such preliminary site and construction plans as will provide the planning commission and the city council a sound basis upon which to reach a decision. Upon rezoning, a petition for conditional use is required. An application for rezoning and a petition for conditional use may be jointly filed and acted upon. 
Applications for travel trailer parks and campgrounds shall be processed in accordance with procedures set forth in the city subdivision regulations. The same information and data shall be furnished at each stage of plan approval as is required in subdivision plat approval, but no final plat shall be made of record. 
After all required improvements have been completed for a travel trailer park or campground, or an approved construction unit of a park or campground, the city departments involved shall in writing confirm to the city manager or his designee (that said improvements have been completed. Until a site is approved) for occupancy, no travel trailer or other unit shall be placed thereon. 
3.10.8. - Combined manufactured/mobile home and travel trailer park. 
    Joint manufactured/mobile home parks and travel trailer parks shall be conditional uses within the MH-2 zone. All development standards will be in accordance with section 3.10.4. The application for conditional use shall clearly delineate those areas to be devoted to such uses and shall particularly include details as to how the manufactured/mobile home section shall be buffered from the travel trailer section. No mixing of travel trailer and manufactured/mobile home sites is permitted. No vehicular access to the travel trailer and manufactured/mobile home sites is permitted. No vehicular access to the travel trailer section shall be through the manufactured/mobile home section of the park, and the manufactured/mobile home portion of the park shall have a least one entrance and exit which does not require passage through the travel trailer or campground section. Recreation facilities may be jointly used, but the total percentages of land area to be devoted to recreation facilities must total the percentages as for manufactured/mobile home park and travel trailer park or campground separately computed. 
3.10.9. - Height regulations. 
    No building or structure shall exceed 35 feet in height. 
3.10.10. - Signs. 
    Regulations, see division 19 of this article.

    See nonconforming uses, section 3.20 of this code. 
DIVISION 10A. - MH-A, MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME ANNEXATION DISTRICT 

3.10A.1. - Description of district. 
    The manufactured/mobile home annexation district (MH-A) is designed for individual lots and parcels. 
A.  All individual lots or parcels heretofore regularly zoned for manufactured/mobile home use in the unincorporated areas adjoining the city, which have been annexed to the city since the same was established by Laws of Fla. ch. 65-2166, and which at the time of annexation were assigned to a manufactured/mobile home zoning classification. 
B.  An individual lot or parcel, heretofore regularly zoned and utilized for manufactured/mobile home use in an unincorporated area adjoining the city upon application by its owner for, and its subsequent, annexation to the city. 
C.  An individual lot or parcel, heretofore regularly zoned but not utilized for manufactured/mobile home use (i.e., vacant) in an unincorporated area adjoining the city upon application by its owner for, and its subsequent, annexation to the city; provided that in the case of a vacant lot, prior to annexation, there shall be a finding by the city council that manufactured/mobile home use for such lot is the only use compatible with the adjoining and nearby uses. 
The mixing of manufactured/mobile homes and conventional dwellings in a neighborhood is found to be incompatible and is specifically prohibited by these regulations. 
3.10A.2. - Uses permitted. 
    Within an MH-A, manufactured/mobile home annexation district, no building, structure, land, or water shall be used except for a single-family manufactured/mobile home. 
A.  Permitted accessory uses and structures. Uses and structures which: 
1.  Are customarily accessory and clearly incidental and subordinate to permitted or permissible uses and structures; 
2.  Are located on the same lot as the permitted or permissible use or structure, or on a contiguous lot in the same ownership; 
3.  Do not involve operations or structures not in keeping with the character of the district. 
3.10A.3. - Conditional uses. 
    There are no conditional uses in a manufactured/mobile home annexation district. 
3.10A.4. - Building height, site area, yard regulations, minimum lot width and maximum lot coverage. 
    Maximum building height, and lot coverage, minimum site area, yard regulations, and lot width are as referenced in Table III-4. 
    No building or structure shall exceed 35 feet in height, unless this provision is waived by the city council. 
3.10A.5. - Density regulations. 
    Maximum density shall not exceed one dwelling unit per residential 7,500 square feet. 
3.10A.6. - Parking regulations. 
    (For parking regulations, see division 18 of this article.) 
3.10A.7. - Sign regulations. 
    (For sign regulations, see division 19 of this article). 
3.10A.8. - Bicycle parking. 
    (For bicycle parking regulations, See division 18 of this article.) 
3.10A.9. - Rezoning to MH-A, prohibited. 
    No owner of a lot or parcel existing within the corporate limits of the city, following the establishment of this section (10A), shall make application for inclusion of such lot or parcel in the manufactured/mobile home annexation district by rezoning, nor shall such rezoning be permitted; inclusion in the manufactured/mobile home annexation district shall occur only as an initial zoning upon annexation.

DIVISION 11. - PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

3.11.1. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this section to permit planned unit developments which are intended to promote efficient and economical land use, an improved level of amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety in physical development, creative design, improved living environments, orderly and economical development in the city, and the protection of adjacent and nearby existing and future city development. The district is suitable for development, redevelopment and conservation of land, water, and other resources of the city. 
    Regulations for planned unit developments are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning, subdivision regulation, and other applicable city regulations to the same degree as in instances where such city regulations are intended to control development on a lot-by-lot basis rather than on a unified development approach. In view of the substantial public advantages of planned unit development, it is the intent of PUD regulations to promote and encourage development in this form where tracts suitable in size, location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed as unified and coordinated units. 
A.  Development of district. The planned unit development district is composed of a single planned development which: (1) is land under unified control, planned and developed as a whole in a single development operation or approved programmed series of development operations for dwelling units and related uses and facilities; (2) includes principal and accessory uses and structures substantially related to the character of the development itself and the surrounding areas of which it is a part; (3) is developed according to comprehensive and detailed plans which include not only streets, utilities, lots or building sites and the like, but also site plans, floor plans, and the elevations for all buildings as intended to be located, constructed, used, and related to each other, and detailed plans for other uses and improvements on the land as related to the buildings; and (4) includes a program for full provision, maintenance and operation of such areas, improvements, facilities, and services as will be for common use by some or all of the occupants of the planned unit development, but will not be provided, operated or maintained at public expense. 
3.11.2. - Permitted uses. 
    The uses permitted within the planned unit development district shall include the following: 
A.  Residential planned unit development. 
1.  Residential units, including townhouses, condominiums, patio homes, zero lot line homes and detached dwellings, foster care facilities, community residential homes, and family day care homes. 
2.  Churches, schools, community or club buildings, and similar public and semipublic facilities. 
3.  Nonresidential uses, commercial or retail uses, offices, clinics, hospitals, and professional uses, provided the following criteria are met: 
a.  The location is an appropriate relation to other land use; 
b.  Adequate economic justification studies are submitted showing the need for any proposed nonresidential; the proposed nonresidential uses are designed to serve primarily the residential use in the planned unit development unless the economic studies indicate greater nonresidential uses are justified or there are no residential uses in the development; 
c.  The nonresidential uses do not utilize more than ten percent of the gross acreage of the development; 
d.  No nonresidential use, nor any building devoted Primarily to a nonresidential use shall be built or established prior to beginning construction of the residential buildings or uses it is intended to serve, of any, without the approval of the city council. 
B.  Commercial planned unit development. 
1.  Commercial or retail uses, offices, professional uses, hospitals, hotels, motels, timeshare uses and alcoholic beverage establishments, minor and restaurant uses. 
2.  Churches, schools, public buildings and similar public/semi-public facilities. 
3.  Residential, multifamily and townhouse attached unit: 
a.  The primary purpose and use within the district is commercial in nature and residential uses are compatible in scale and intensity to uses in the general area; 
b.  Although commercial and office uses in the district may be designed to serve a large area, those uses should also be provided and designed to satisfy, to the extent possible, commercial, service and employment requirements of any residential units in the district. 
3.11.3. - Conditional uses. 
    Conditional uses in the planned unit development district shall be as follows: 
1.  Home occupations; 
2.  Alcoholic beverage establishment, major use. 
3.11.4. - Definitions (applicable to this section). 
    In addition to the definitions contained in article II, definitions, the following terms, phrases, words, and derivations, when used in this article, shall have the following meaning: 
    Common open space. An area of land, or an area of water, or combination of land and water, within the area of a planned unit development which is designated and intended for the use or enjoyment of residents of the planned unit development in common. Common open space may contain such structures and improvements as are desirable and appropriate for the common benefit and enjoyment of residents of the planned unit development. 
    Density. The total number of dwelling units divided by the gross residential acreage figure. 
    Final master plan. The specific plan for the development of the planned unit development which shall include such information as required by section 3.11.7 of this article. 
    Final plat. Those submittals, as required by and following the procedures of the city's subdivision regulations, showing all building lots, easements, rights-of-way, and other information necessary for providing the detailed description of the subdivision of a parcel of land. 
    Final site plan. An illustration of the details of development of areas, such as, but not limited to, commercial, industrial, recreational, and multiple-family residential uses not being platted. The required submittals and processing procedures shall be similar to those provisions for final platting to the extent deemed applicable for the proposed use by the land development coordinator. 
    Gross acreage. The total number of acres within the perimeter boundaries of a planned unit development. 
    Gross residential acreage. Gross acreage less all other nonresidential productive use areas, such as, commercial or industrial acreage and the areas normally part of commercial or industrial areas, such as, parking areas, roads, and buffers. 
    Land owners. The legal or beneficial owner or owners of all the land proposed to be included in a planned unit development; the holder of an option or a contract to purchases; or a person having possessory rights or equal dignity will be deemed to be a land owner for the purpose of this regulation, so long as the written consent of the planned unit development of the owners of all other interest in the land concerned is obtained. 
    Net acreage. The total number of acres within the perimeter boundaries of a planned unit development, excluding areas devoted to major streets, rights-of-way, easements, lakes, public and private common space and recreation areas, floodplain areas, as defined as USGS, and areas which are not suitable for buildings or structures due to soil limitations. 
    Net residential acreage. The net acreage, less all other nonresidential productive use areas, such as, commercial or industrial acreage and the areas normally part of commercial or industrial areas, such as, parking areas, roads and buffer areas. 
    Preliminary master plan. The proposal for development of a planned unit development which shall include such information as required by section 3.11.6 of this article. 
    Preliminary site plan. An illustration of the details of development of areas, such as, but not limited to, commercial, industrial, recreational, and multiple-family residential uses not being platted. The required submittals and processing procedures shall be similar to those provisions for final platting to the extent deemed applicable for the proposed use by the city manager or his designee. 
3.11.5. - Planned unit development approval procedure. 
    Approval for a planned unit development is obtained through a two-step process. The first step is an approval of the preliminary master plan and zoning of the land. The second step consists of final master plan approved along with the recording of the developer's commitment agreement form. 
    Prior to formally submitting a request for planned unit development zoning, the developer should meet with officials of the development review committee for comments regarding the advisability of undertaking a planned unit development in the proposed location. 
3.11.6. - Planned unit development zoning and preliminary master plan approval.

On application for rezoning of land to PUD classification, the planning commission and city council shall proceed in general as for other applications for rezoning of land giving special consideration, however, to the following matters and requirements, and allowing changes in the rezoning application prior to the required planning commission public hearing as follows: 
1.  Prehearing conference with applicants. On request by the applicant, the development review committee shall meet with the applicant or his agent to review the preliminary master plan submitted by the applicant. The purpose of such prehearing conferences shall be to assist in bringing the overall petition as nearly as possible into conformity with these or other regulations applying generally to the property involved and/or to define specifically those variations from application of general regulations which appear justified in view of equivalent service of the public purposes of such regulations. 
In the course of such prehearing conferences, any recommendations for changes shall be recorded in writing and shall become part of the record in the case. All such recommendations shall be supported by stated reasons for the proposal for change. The applicant shall state in writing his agreement to such recommendations, or his disagreement, and if there is disagreement, shall in writing indicate his reasons therefore, and such responses by applicant shall be included in the record. 
At such time as further conferences appear unnecessary, or at any time on the request of the applicant, public notice shall be given and the hearing before the planning commission held as for other applications for rezoning, but the notice and hearing shall be on the petition as it may have been amended following the prehearing conferences rather than as originally submitted. 
2.  Planning commission findings and recommendations. After public hearing, the planning commission may recommend to the city council that the PUD rezoning be granted subject to stated stipulations and conditions, or be disapproved. In making its recommendation, the planning commission shall find that the preliminary master plan submitted by the applicant and presented at the public hearing do or do not establish that the applicant has met the requirements of these regulations applicable to rezoning generally, and in addition: 
a.  The requirements of unified control and agreement set forth herein; 
b.  The locational standards set forth herein; 
c.  The internal PUD standards set forth herein; 
d.  The tract for the proposed PUD is suitable in terms of its relationships to the city comprehensive plan and that the area surrounding the proposed PUD can continue to be developed in coordination and substantial compatibility with the PUD proposed; 
e.  That the desirable modifications of general zoning or PUD regulations as applied to the particular case, justify such modification of regulations and meet to at least an equivalent degree the regulations modified, based on the design and amenities incorporated in the site development plan; 
f.  That increased open space is provided for the occupants of the proposed PUD and the general public, and desirable natural features indigenous to the site are preserved in the development plan presented. 
3.  Binding nature and rezoning to PUD. The conditions, safeguards, and stipulations made at this time of rezoning to PUD shall be binding upon the applicant or any successors in interest. Deviations from approved plans or failure to comply with any requirement, condition, or safeguard shall constitute a violation of these zoning regulations.

3.11.12. - Development standards for planned unit development. 
    The development standards for planned unit development are as follows: 
A.  Unified control. All land included for purpose of development within a PUD district shall be under the control of the applicant, whether that applicant be an individual, partnership, or corporation or a group of individuals, partnerships, or corporations. The applicant shall present firm evidence of the unified control of the entire area within the proposed PUD. The applicant shall state agreement to: (1) proceed with the proposed development according to the provisions of these zoning regulations and such conditions as may be attached to the rezoning of the land to PUD; (2) provide agreements, contracts, deed restrictions, and sureties acceptable to the city for completion of the development according to the plans approved at the time of rezoning to PUD, and for continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, function, and facilities as are not to be provided, operated, or maintained at public expense; and (3) bind their successors in title to any commitments made under (1) and (2) preceding. All such agreements and evidence of unified control shall be examined by the city attorney, and no rezoning of land to PUD classification shall be adopted without a certification by the city attorney that such agreements and evidence of unified control meet the requirements of those zoning regulations. 
B.  Reserved. (Ord. No. 2005-84, 8-11-2005) 
C.  Location standards. In reaching recommendations and decisions as to rezoning land to PUD classification, the planning commission and the city council shall apply the following locational standards, in addition to the standards of these zoning regulations applicable to the rezoning of land generally: 
1.  Conformity with the comprehensive plan. PUD's shall be located in conformity with the comprehensive plan and particularly to the future land use element of the comprehensive plan. 
2.  Relation to major transportation facilities. PUD's shall be so located with respect to arterial or major streets, highways, collector streets, or other transportation facilities as to provide direct access to such PUD's without creating or generating traffic along minor streets in residential areas or districts outside the PUD. 
3.  Relation to utilities, public facilities, and services. PUD's shall be so located in relation to sanitary sewers, water lines, storm and surface drainage systems, and other utilities systems and installations that neither extension nor enlargement of such systems will be required in manner, form, character, location, degree, scale, or timing resulting in higher net public cost or earlier incursion of public cost than would development in forms generally permitted under existing zoning in the area. Such PUD's shall be so located with respect to necessary public facilities (e.g., schools, parks and playgrounds) as to have access to such facilities in the same degree as would development permitted under existing zoning, and shall be so located, designed and scaled that access for such public services is equivalent to, and net cost for such services is not greater than, access and net costs for public services for development as permitted under existing zoning. 
a.  Exceptions. If applicants will: (1) provide private facilities, utilities, or services approved by appropriate public agencies as substituting on an equivalent basis, and assure their satisfactory continuing operation permanently, or until similar public utilities, facilities, or services are available and used, or (2) make provision acceptable to the city for offsetting any added net public cost or early commitment of public funds made necessary by such development, the rezoning to PUD may be approved. 
b.  Computation of costs. In computing added net public costs, difference in anticipated public installation, operation, and maintenance costs and difference in anticipated public revenue shall be considered. Expenses involved in making such determinations as may be required in establishing added net public costs shall be paid by the applicant. Determination shall be made by the city or by experts acceptable to the city. 
4.  Physical character of the site. The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract, from probability of flooding, erosion, or other dangers, annoyances, or inconveniences. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and topography shall all be appropriate to both kind and pattern of use intended. 
D.  Internal PUD standards. In addition to the standards set in Table 1 below, the following standards apply within a PUD district: (Ord. No. 2000-27, 8-9-2000) 
1.  Access. Every dwelling unit, or other use permitted in the PUD, shall have access to a public street either directly or via an approved private road, pedestrian way, court, or other area dedicated to public or private use, or common element guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not required to front on a dedicated public road. 
2.  Internal lots and frontage. Within the boundaries of the PUD, no minimum lot size or minimum yards shall be required; provided, however, that PUD frontage or dedicated public roads shall observe front yard requirements in accordance with the zoning district the PUD use most closely resembles and that peripheral yards abutting other zoning districts shall be the same as required in the abutting zone. 
3.  Off-street parking and off-street requirements. See division 18 of this article. 
4.  Commercial standards, residential PUD's. Commercial uses located in a residential PUD are intended to serve the needs of the PUD and not the general needs of a surrounding area. The maximum area within a residential PUD which may be devoted to neighborhood commercial uses including required off-street parking requirements, is governed by Table 1 below and division 18 of this article. Areas designated for commercial activities normally shall not front on exterior or perimeter streets, but shall be centrally located within the project to serve the residents of the PUD. No off-site advertisements, advertising signs or advertising structures shall be constructed or erected, used, or maintained in any part or portion of a residential PUD. 
TABLE 1 

(Ord. No. 2000-27, 8-9-2000) 

(MAXIMUM COMMERCIAL FOR RESIDENTIAL PUD) Population 
(persons) Maximum Commercial 1,500 5% 1,501-2,000 6% 2,001-2,500 8% 2,501 10%  
5.  Underground facilities. Within a PUD, all utilities, including telephone, television cable, and electrical systems shall be installed underground. Appurtenances to these systems which require above ground installation must be effectively screened and, thereby, may be excepted from this requirement. Primary facilities providing service to the site of the PUD may be excepted. 
6.  Dedications. Dedication for public utilization of a maximum of ten percent of gross land area for schools, parks, fire stations, roadways and other improvements may be required where such dedication is in conformity with the comprehensive plan for the area involved and a finding is made by the appropriate public body that a demonstrated need exists arising from impacts of the development or where such needs have been formally identified in appropriate plans prior to the development proposal. Contributions of cash, in lieu equal to the approximate value of the land contribution may be made where the land donations are less than five acres or where the city council approves such cash contribution. Such contribution shall be placed in a trust by the city for purchase or development of recreational facilities in the general area of the PUD. 
7.  Open space. In general, increased intensity of use within a PUD shall be offset by an increase in the proportion of lands reserved as open and living space areas. While current FHA land use intensity (LUI) criteria may be used as a guide, the city council shall consider the quality of overall design and amenities as well in approving plans. 
8.  General design. In general, design standards applicable to subdivisions shall apply. However, it is expected that well documented designs which provide justification for streets and alternative placement of structures will be considered provided such changes are necessary to allow for improvement of the overall quality of design as well as of amenities provided within the development. 
9.  Bicycle parking. See division 18 of this article. 
E.  Perimeter requirements. The city council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, may impose one or both of the following requirements in order to protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses: 
1.  Permanent screening. Structures, buildings, and streets located at the perimeter of the development shall be permanently screened in a manner which sufficiently protects the privacy and amenities of the adjacent existing uses. (See article VIII, Landscaping and Tree Protection). 
2.  Increased setbacks. Increased setbacks from the perimeter line may be imposed to protect privacy of adjacent existing uses.

3.12.1. - Description of district. 
    The intent of the professional district is to promote orderly and logical development of land for offices and service activities, to discourage integration of noncomplimentary land uses that may interfere with the proper function of the district, and to assure adequate design in order to maintain the integrity of existing or future nearby residential areas. The ultimate site plan must provide a low intensity of land usage and site coverage to enable the lot to retain a well-landscaped image so as to readily blend with nearby residential areas; buildings are low profile. It is intended that a minimum number of points of ingress and egress be utilized in order to reduce the impact of traffic on adjacent streets and thus enhance traffic movement. 
    The professional district is compatible with and is to be only assigned within a public institutional, professional/private, commercial, industrial or recreational land use designation on the city's comprehensive plan, future land use map.

2.  The performance standard. Building heights may be increased if the amount of shadow cast by the proposed building on the adjacent open space will be less than or equal to the shadow that would result from an allowed building constructed to the district's maximum height. The shadow from an allowed building is based on the shadow that would be cast by a structure covering the entire site at the height limit permitted. Shadows must be analyzed for noon and 3:00 p.m. on April 21 to determine compliance with this provision. 
I.  Performance standard for sites within and/or adjacent to historic overlay districts.

When the project's frontage on its block is larger than the historic overlay district's frontage on the facing block, the street wall must extend 25 feet beyond the end of the historic overlay district. 
e.  The street wall must be at least 35 feet in height or equal to the distance of the horizontal encroachment into the area regulated by the lower height limit, whichever is more. 
However, portions of the building that is within and/or front the historic overlay district may not exceed 105 feet in height or ten stories, within 25 feet of the street lot line. Building step back distances greater than 25 feet from the facing historic overlay district may achieve the maximum building height permitted for that underlying zoning district. 
f.  The existing building wall of a historical landmark incorporated into the project is exempt from the requirements of subparagraphs d. and e., above. 
g.  Portions of the structure located behind the street wall must provide for active street-level nonresidential commercial use; 
h.  The project may not result in a building that exceeds a maximum height of 155 feet or 15 stories or the higher of the two height limits on the block, whichever is lower. 
3.  Approval of a height increase based on this subsection in no way limits the ability of the review body conducting design review to require reconfiguration of the building's design, including lowering the height of the building or reducing the amount of the increase. The review body will base its review on application of both the general design guidelines applicable to the area, and the guidelines applicable to the adjacent historic district. 
4.  Adjustments to requirements and standards of this subsection are prohibited, unless approved by the city manager or their designee.

Former Div. 17 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the St. Cloud Land Development Code adopted by Ord. No. 87-EEE on Sept. 10, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987 and reapproved and readopted by Ord. No. 87-FFF on Oct. 8, 1987. 

3.17.1. - Description of districts. 
    The industrial districts are composed of areas of land in locations that are suitable to provide for research, technological applications, and industrial development. These areas are also suitable for those uses which are more intense or noncompatible with those uses within other commercial districts. The purpose of the industrial districts is to encourage and develop industrial applications of varying types and to protect surrounding land uses from encroachment of noncompatible uses, smoke, fumes, vibrations, or odors of any objectionable nature. 
    Industrial district 1 (I-1) is intended to provide for development which allows for office, research, technology application, warehousing and light industrial uses. In addition, this district provides for uses which are commercial in nature but are more intense or noncompatible with existing uses within commercial districts. 
    Industrial district 2 (I-2) is intended for development which is industrial in nature. Industrial uses are those activities which involve the manufacturing, fabricating, processing, converting, altering and assembling, warehousing and the testing of products. Also included are those administrative functions and uses which are required for proper management of, control of, and directly related to industrial activity. 
    Industrial park (PUD) district 3 (I-3) is intended for negotiated industrial development which allows for maximum flexibility of design within the portion of the parcel that can be developed.

The medical marijuana dispensary shall not permit any patient or business invitee to stand, sit (including in a parked car), or gather or loiter outside of the building where the dispensary operates, including in any parking areas, for any period of time longer than that reasonably required to arrive and depart. 
B.  Security. The owners shall have a review of the site with the city police department prior to opening and annually. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to schedule the reviews with the department. 
C.  No drive-through service. No medical marijuana dispensary shall have a drive-through or drive-in service. All dispensing, payment for and receipt of medical marijuana shall occur from inside the medical marijuana dispensary. 
D.  Alcoholic beverages or marijuana. No sale of alcoholic beverages or consumption or use of alcoholic beverages or marijuana shall be allowed on the premises, including in the parking areas. 
E.  Separation distances. A medical marijuana dispensary shall not operate within 1,500 feet of another approved medical marijuana dispensary or within 200 feet of any residentially zoned or residentially used property, or within 750 feet of a public park, child care center or school existing or approved by the city at the time of application. All distance requirements shall be measured by drawing a straight line from the nearest property line of the protected use to the nearest property line of the proposed medical marijuana dispensary. 
F.  Operating hours. Medical marijuana dispensaries shall not be allowed to operate between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
G.  Inspection of approved premises. During business hours and other times of apparent activity, all approved premises shall be subject to inspection by the fire chief, the building official, code enforcement officer, police chief, or authorized representative of any of them, for the purpose of investigating and determining compliance with provisions of this article and any other applicable state or local law or regulation. Such inspection may include, but need not be limited to, the inspection of books, records, and inventory. Where any part of the premises consists of a locked area, such area shall be made available for inspection, without delay, upon reasonable request. The frequency of such inspections shall not be unreasonable and shall be conducted in a manner to ensure the operation of the premises is not inhibited. 
H.  Requirements related to the premises. Medical marijuana dispensaries shall be subject to the following additional requirements: 
a.  All cannabis or cannabis derivative products ready for sale shall be in a sealed or locked container or cabinet except when being accessed for distribution.

a.  The owner or lessor of the premises, the applicant, or the operator of the medical marijuana dispensary or his or her agent, manager, or employee, have violated, do not meet, or have failed to comply with, any of the terms, mandatory requirements or other provisions of the conditional use permit or any applicable state, county or city law or regulation. 
b.  Any applicable provision related to revocation of a certificate of use as set forth in section 12-137 of the City Code. 
c.  Prior to revocation of the conditional use permit issued hereunder, the city shall provide Notice and an opportunity to request a hearing before the city council. 
d.  Any conditional use permit issued hereunder shall be automatically revoked if the owner of the premises fails to execute the conditional use permit within 30 days of its approval or the medical marijuana dispensary fails to commence dispensing within 12 months after the conditional use permit has been issued. 
J.  Compliance with other laws. All medical marijuana dispensaries shall at all times be in compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations, and the City of St. Cloud Code of Ordinances, as may be amended from time to time.

DIVISION 18. - OFF-STREET AND BICYCLE PARKING, LOADING 

3.18.1. - Minimum off-street parking requirement. 
    At the time of the erection of any main building or structure, or any main building is enlarged or increased in capacity, or when a structure undergoes a change in use, or that dwelling units, guestrooms or floor areas are added (see section 3.18.3.B.2 for residential requirements), minimum off-street parking spaces and bicycle parking with adequate provisions for ingress and egress shall be provided in accordance with the requirements listed in Table III-8. (Ord. No. 95-29, 7-13-1995 ) 
    It is the intent of this section to encourage design features which reduce the overall trip requirements entering and leaving a site. Such design features may include but are not limited to cross access for pedestrian bikeway circulation as part of an overall system, design of facilities to integrate adjoining uses, participation by the site or businesses on the site in shuttle bus service systems or similar circulation systems not relying on the use of automobiles. 
3.18.2. - Off-street parking requirements. 
    The following are the special restrictions for off-street parking requirements in all zoning districts: 
A.  Recreational vehicle storage in multifamily development is prohibited unless designated areas for recreational vehicles are provided. Such designated parking areas must be in excess of the required parking for the residential units. 
B.  Parking spaces for all uses shall be located on the same lot with the main building to be served except when the parking can meet the following requirements: 
1.  The city council may allow the establishment of off-street parking facilities within 300 feet of the premises they are intended to serve when: (Ord. No. 2015-09 , § 1, 2-26-2015) 
a.  Practical difficulties prevent the placing of the facilities on the same lot as the premises they are designed to serve; 
b.  The owner of the said parking area shall enter into a written agreement with the city, in a form acceptable to the city, with enforcement running to the city providing that the land comprising the parking area shall never be disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building which the parking area serves so long as the facilities are required; and 
c.  The owner agrees to bear the expenses of recording the agreement and agrees that the agreement shall bind his heirs, successors, and assigns. The written agreement may be voided by the city if other off-street facilities are provided in accord with these zoning regulations. 
C.  Parking requirements for two or more uses which do not conflict due to the nature and time of usage may be satisfied by the allocation of a required number of spaces in a common parking facility. Such allocation must be supported by evidence of expected parking patterns, must fully meet expected parking demand for all common users and of the approval of plans by the city council. Any change in uses which share a common parking facility will require a re-evaluation of the approval by the city council and must be incorporated into a permanent mutually binding contractual use agreement approved by the city attorney. 
(Ord. No. 96-21, 8-22-1996; Ord. No. 2015-09 , § 1, 2-26-2015) 
3.18.3. - Parking stall calculations, design and permanent reservation requirements. 
A.  Design standards and dimension requirements. A table of design standards and dimension requirements for parking spaces are provided in article VI, design standards. 
1.  Minimum required parking stall depths may be reduced by up to two feet provided the reduced amount is added to adjacent required landscaping, required open space or pedestrian travel ways as approved by the city manager or his designee. (Ord. No. 2001-40, 9-27-2001) 
B.  Calculation of the required off-street parking and loading and unloading spaces. 
1.  Fractions of a space up to and including one-half shall be disregarded when determining the minimum requirements of this section 18. Any fraction of a space over one-half shall require a space. Parking shall be provided as required herein, however, a minimum of one space shall be required for the first space regardless of fractions. (Ord. No. 2001-40, 9-27-2001) 
2.  Single-family, duplex, mobile home or manufactured home use only: Paved driveway, paved area beneath a carport, and area within a garage shall be used to satisfy the minimum requirements for parking. (Ord. No. 2001-40, 9-27-2001) 
3.  Parking areas, loading and unloading areas and travel ways shall not be physically altered or used for any other use than their intended use unless approved as part of a revised site plan and/or building permit as provided for in these regulations. (Ord. No. 2001-40, 9-27-2001) 
4.  The city manager or his designee may grant up to a 20 percent reduction of the off-street parking requirements as identified in Table III-8. The request shall be supported by a parking study completed by a traffic engineer. 
C.  Determination of use. If a use is not compatible with a use listed in Table III-8 or if the parking demand of a listed use is subject to conditions and situations which would warrant a parking requirement other than those listed in Table III-8, an applicant may apply to the city council for a determination of parking. Prior to the review and approval by the city council, the planning commission shall review the application and provide a recommendation to the city council. Said determination by the city council shall be made following public hearing after due written notice to the adjacent property owners by certified mail and notice posted on the affected property. (Ord. No. 96-21, 8-22-1996; Ord. No. 2001-40, 9-27-2001; Ord. No. 2015-09 , § 2, 2-16-2015) 
3.18.4. - Bicycle parking requirements. 
A.  All bicycle parking area locations are subject to the approval of the city manager or his designee, or the development review committee when stipulated by the city manager or his designee. In addition, each bicycle parking area shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  Contain a bicycle parking rack and shall be identified by signage which is subject to the approval of the city manager or his designee. 
2.  Minimum width shall be two feet and minimum length shall be six feet. 
B.  Bicycle parking shall be calculated by determining a percentage of the requirements for vehicles. (See Table III-8.) 
3.18.5. - Off-street loading and unloading area requirement. 
    On the same premises with every building, structure or part thereof, erected and occupied, and any use which requires deliveries and is involved in the receipt or distribution by vehicles of materials or merchandise, shall provide and maintain on the lot adequate space for the maneuvering, standing, loading, and unloading services in order to avoid undue interference with public use of the streets or alleys. Such locations are subject to review and approval by the city manager or his designee. 
A.  Off-street loading and unloading space defined. An open, hard-surfaced area, other than a street or public way, the principal use of which is for standing, loading and unloading of motor trucks tractors and trailers. Such space shall not be less than 12 feet in width, 45 feet in length and 14 feet in height, exclusive of access aisles and maneuvering space. 
B.  Criteria specified. For every building or structure or part thereof having an area 4,000 square feet or less of building floor area and used for the purposes mentioned above, loading and unloading required spaces shall be determined by the city manager or his designee. For every building or structure or part thereof having an area 4,000 square feet or more of building floor area when used for the purposes mentioned above, off-street loading and unloading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the following guidelines, with a minimum of one space required: 
Category Gross Floor Area and Spaces Required A minimum of one space shall be required. Manufacturing, Warehouse, or Service Establishments 1 space per 40,000 square feet gross floor area Retail Sales 1 space per 25,000 square feet gross floor area Commercial Recreation 1 space per 50,000 square feet gross floor area

State Law reference- Right to establish sign ordinance, F.S. § 166.0425; usage and removal of political campaign advertisements, regulation of signs within rights-of-way, F.S. § 337.407; outdoor advertising, F.S. ch. 479. 

3.19.1. - Purpose and intent of division. 
A.  The intent of this division is to ensure adequate means of communication through signage while maintaining a safe environment and attractive visual appearance within the city. By specifying criteria for all signage, this division is intended to serve the following purposes: 
1.  Maintain the established small-town character within the city's historic district while accounting for the city's suburban and urban growth outside the historic district by regulating all exterior signage in a manner that is consistent with promoting such goals. 
2.  Protect and maintain the visual integrity of roadway corridors within the city by establishing a maximum amount of signage on any one site to reduce visual clutter. 
3.  Establish locations and setbacks for signage that are designed to protect motorists from visual distractions, obstructions and hazards. 
4.  Enhance the appearance of the physical environment by requiring that signage be designed as an integral architectural feature of the site and structure for which such signage is intended to identify, and be located in a manner that is sensitive to the existing natural environment. 
5.  Provide for signage that satisfies the needs of the local business community for visibility, identification and communication. 
6.  Establish procedures for the removal or replacement of nonconforming signs, enforcement of these regulations, maintenance of existing signs, and consideration of variances and appeals. 
7.  Facilitate clear communication of messages. 
8.  Reduce hazards to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
9.  Prevent signs that may mislead or confuse the public. 
B.  The regulation of signs as provided herein is based upon their function, and is not based upon the content of the message contained on any such sign. The Florida Constitution provides that it is the policy of the state to conserve and protect its scenic beauty, and the regulation of signage for purposes of aesthetics directly serves that policy. In order to preserve the city as a desirable community in which to live, visit and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is of foremost importance. The regulation of signs within the city is a highly contributive means by which to achieve this desired end. These sign regulations are prepared with the intent of enhancing the small-town environment and promoting the continued well-being of the city. The enhancement of the visual environment is critical to a community's image and safety, and the sign control principles set forth herein create a sense of character and ambiance that distinguishes the city as one with a commitment to maintaining and improving an attractive and safe environment. 
The city council recognizes that there are various persons and entities that have an interest in communicating with the public through the use of signs that serve to identify businesses and services, residences and neighborhoods, and also to provide for expression of opinions. The council is also responsible for furthering the city's obligation to its residents and visitors to maintain a safe and aesthetically pleasing environment where signs do not create excessive visual clutter and distraction or hazards for pedestrians and vehicles; where signs do not adversely impact the small-town character of the city's historic district or the suburban and urban growth outside of the historic district; and where signs do not conflict with the natural and scenic qualities of the city. It is the intent of the council that the regulations contained in this division shall provide a uniform sign criteria that regulates the size, height, number and placement of signs in a manner that is compatible with the unique qualities of the various zoning districts, and which shall place the fewest possible restrictions on personal liberties, property rights, free commerce, and the free exercise of Constitutional rights, all while achieving the city's goal of creating a safe, healthy, attractive and aesthetically pleasing environment that does not contain excessive clutter or visual distraction from right-of-ways and adjacent properties, the surrounding natural environment, and residential neighborhoods. 
C.  Findings of fact. The city council finds that: 
1.  The manner of the erection, location and maintenance of signs affects the public health, safety, or welfare of the people in this community and the general public. 
2.  The safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, other users of the public streets is affected by the number, size, location, lighting and movement of signs that divert an individual's attention. 
3.  The size and location of signs may, if uncontrolled, constitute an obstacle to effective fire-fighting techniques and other emergency management services. 
4.  The construction, erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or placed on the tops of buildings, walls or other structures may constitute a direct danger to pedestrian and vehicular traffic below, especially during periods of strong winds, such as those caused by hurricanes and Central Florida thunderstorms. 
5.  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of the city's small-town character within the historic district and suburban or urban growth outside the historic district. 
D.  Substitution clause. It is not the intent of this division to afford greater protection to commercial speech than to non-commercial speech. Any commercial sign, display or device allowed under this division may contain any lawful non-commercial message that complies with all other requirements applicable to the sign. The non-commercial message may occupy the entire display area or any portion thereof, and may substitute for or be combined with the commercial message, provided that the sign is not prohibited and continues to comply with all requirements of this division. Thus, notwithstanding any provisions that may be interpreted to the contrary, this division allows a sign containing non-commercial copy to the same extent as a sign containing commercial copy. 
E.  With respect to any definitions, names, or descriptions throughout the land development code that attempt to define a particular type of sign, such is merely for the purpose of understanding the sign code's provisions in a reasonable manner. The definition or description is not provided with the intent to regulate or restrict the content that may be displayed on the sign. Rather, it is to explain the common purpose or activity for which the sign is used generally. 
( Ord. No. 2018-29, § 2, 11-15-2018 ) 
3.19.2. - Appeals and variances. 
A.  Appeals. Any individual or entity, or their duly authorized agent, aggrieved by a decision of the city manager or his/her designee with respect to this division may file a written appeal within 30 days after the disputed decision has been made by the city manager or his/her designee. Appeals shall be filed with the city manager and shall state fully the grounds for the appeal and all facts relied upon by the petitioner. The city manager shall schedule the appeal to be heard by the city council within 21 days from receipt of the written appeal. The city council shall then render a decision within 30 days after hearing the appeal. If the city council does not grant the appeal, the petitioner may seek relief in the Circuit Court for Osceola County, Florida, as provided by law. 
B.  Variances. The board of adjustment shall hear variances to the sign regulations.

3.19.3. - Permits required.

B.  Applications for a sign permit shall be submitted to the planning and zoning department for approval and shall comply with the following requirements: 
1.  Said application shall consist of a scaled drawing showing the detail, dimensions and copy of said sign, along with the dimensions of the building and proposed location of the sign(s). 
2.  When application is made for a new freestanding sign, which is within three feet of the required setbacks measured to the nearest drip edge of the sign, such application shall be accompanied by a new or existing survey of the lot that has been made by a land surveyor licensed in Florida. 
3.  Except in the case of a temporary sign, all applications shall include an affidavit from the owner of the parcel of property where the sign is to be displayed giving permission to the tenant and/or contractor to apply for such permit. 
4.  No sign permit shall be issued unless the establishment for which the sign will serve as identification has made application for a business tax receipt and/or certificate of use as applicable.

D.  All signs shall be erected within 180 days of issuance of the permit; otherwise the permit shall become null and void. 
E.  Multiple businesses. In the case of a lot occupied or intended to be occupied by multiple business enterprises (e.g., a shopping center), sign permits shall be issued in the name of the lot owner or his/her agent rather than in the name of the individual business enterprise requesting a particular sign. The city shall be responsible for enforcing only the provisions of this chapter and not the provisions of any allocation formula, lease, or other private restriction. 
F.  Issuance. Upon receipt of the required application and permit fee, the city manager or his/her designee shall review the plans, specifications and other pertinent information relating to the proposed sign, and if deemed necessary inspect the premises upon which the proposed sign is to be displayed, prior to issuing a permit. Within 30 days of receiving the required application and permit fee, the city manager or his/her designee shall approve, deny or request additional information from the applicant seeking the sign permit. If the permit fee has been paid, the required application was accurate and did not include any false or misleading information, and the proposed sign is in compliance with this division, then the city manager or his/her designee shall issue the sign permit. 
G.  No sign shall be approved for use, nor alteration be allowed, until the sign has been inspected by the city manager or his/her designee and found to be in compliance with all the requirements of this article and applicable technical codes, including the following: 
1.  All structural, electrical and safety features shall be in accordance with the Florida Building Code and National Electrical Code. 
2.  All signs shall comply with provisions of the zoning district in which they are located. 
3.  All signs, together with all supports, braces, anchors, etc., shall be kept in continual repair, including the replacement of defective parts, repainting, cleaning and otherwise in a presentable condition. 
4.  The owner and/or tenant of the premises and the owner and/or erector of the sign shall be held responsible for any violation of these regulations. 
5.  After due notice of violation, the city manager or his/her designee shall process the violation through the code enforcement board for determination of penalties. 
6.  Prior to final inspection of new freestanding signage, the owner or his/her agent or the contractor of record, shall supply to the building official, a final survey made by a land surveyor licensed in the state. This document shall be retained by the building department as a public record. 
H.  Notwithstanding the issuance of a permit hereunder, the city manager or his/her designee may at any time suspend or revoke an approved permit and immediately cause the sign to be removed, if it is determined that the sign fails to meet any of the conditions contained in this division, article or the building code. 
( Ord. No. 2018-29, § 2, 11-15-2018 )

A.  Permit fees are based on the value of each sign erected and shall be as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time.

Structures determined to be deteriorated or dilapidated, as defined herein, by the building official shall be repaired or rehabilitated to a sound construction condition prior to, or concurrently with, approval of any extension or alteration. Those structures found to be unsafe shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation or demolition in accordance with the provisions of the Standard Unsafe Building Abatement Code. In addition to the standard building inspection, one of the following conditions must be met:

4.  Nonconforming structures created by address changes required to meet 911 addressing criteria. When a change in address required by the 911 system causes a structure to become nonconforming with regard to required setbacks, that structure hereinafter shall be considered to be conforming with regard to setbacks. Additions to the structure shall be considered based on the required setbacks prior to the address change. Reconstruction after any event that causes the structure to be completely removed shall comply with the Land Development Code requirements at the time an application for the replacement structure is submitted to the city. 
5.  Nonconforming residential structures and uses created by a rezoning to comply with the comprehensive plan future land use map. Any residential structures or uses made nonconforming with development criteria included in the Land Development Code as a result of Comprehensive Plan consistency based amendments to the Zoning District Map that are approved on or after September 23, 2010 shall be considered conforming for the purpose of continuance of use and additions to the structure. These residential uses shall be subject to the development criteria in the zoning district prior to the rezoning. Upon change of the use to a conforming use the structure shall not be converted back to a residential use and all development criteria in the rezoned zoning district shall become applicable. (Ord. No. 2010-39, § 1, 9-23-2010)

(Ord. No. 97-02, 2-27-1997) 
3.  No unlawful use of property or structures existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be entitled to any of the benefits or exceptions applicable to nonconforming uses or structures.

5.  Only buildings or structures for which a building permit has been obtained, and construction has been diligently prosecuted, will be allowed to continue construction as a nonconforming use or structure. Failure to complete work in accordance with the permit or within approved time limits shall void any claim to nonconforming rights. 
F.  Nonconforming lots. 
1.  Nonconforming lot of record. A lot of record is defined as a parcel of land, the dimensions of which are shown on a recorded plat on file with the clerk of the circuit court, or other official record, at the time of the adoption of the original zoning codes (June 24, 1969), and which actually exists as so shown or a lot or parcel described by metes and bounds, the description of which has been so recorded on or before the effective date of the original zoning codes. 
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record existing at the time of the original zoning code (June 24, 1969), notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the zoning regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage of the original zoning ordinance (June 24, 1969), and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this code, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or area below the requirements stated in this zoning code. 
2.  Nonconforming lot. Nonconforming lots are defined as lots which do not meet the required lot width and/or area requirements and are not defined as lots of record. No construction shall be permitted on a vacant nonconforming lot until such time as the board of adjustments has reviewed and approved any requested variances. Any structure on a nonconforming lot shall be considered a nonconforming structure. 
Lots which are annexed into the city, after being platted under county jurisdiction and are assigned a city zoning classification as close to the county zoning as possible, shall not be considered to be nonconforming lots. Said determination to be made by the city council at the time of annexation.

B.  Administration. 
1.  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of the City of St. Cloud. 
2.  Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
3.  Intent. The purposes of this section and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
a.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
b.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
c.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
d.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
e.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
f.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
g.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
h.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
4.  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This section is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
5.  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this section and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this section. 
6.  Disclaimer of liability. This section shall not create liability on the part of the City Council of the City of St. Cloud or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
C.  Applicability.

2.  Areas to which this section applies. This section shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of St. Cloud as established in this section. 
3.  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The flood insurance study for Osceola County, Florida, and incorporated areas dated June 18, 2013, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this section and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file in the public services offices. 
4.  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
a.  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this section and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
b.  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
5.  Minimum elevation. The lowest floor elevation for all new or substantial improved buildings or structures in the special flood hazard areas shall be a minimum of 16 inches above the base flood elevation. 
6.  Other laws. The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
7.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section supersedes any section in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing sections, including, but not limited to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this section and any other section, the more restrictive shall govern. This section shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this section. 
8.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be: 
a.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
b.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
c.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

2.  A permittee shall pay, and by its acceptance of a permit specifically agrees to pay, any and all damages or penalties which the city may be legally required to pay as a result of the permittee's operation or maintenance of a sidewalk café under this part, whether or not the acts or omissions complained of are authorized, allowed or prohibited by the city. 
3.  A permittee shall also pay all expenses incurred by the city in defending itself with regard to any and all damages and penalties mentioned in subsection 1. above. These expenses shall include all out-of-pocket expenses, including a reasonable attorney's fee and the reasonable value of services rendered by any employee of the city. 
4.  The permittee shall maintain, throughout the term of the permit, liability insurance insuring the city and the permittee with regard to all damages mentioned in subsection 1 above caused by the grantee or its agents, in the minimum amounts of: 
a.  Workers' and unemployment compensation insurance as provided by the laws of this state. 
b.  Two hundred thousand dollars for property damage, bodily injury, or death payable to any one person and $1,000,000.00 for property damage, bodily injury or death when totaled with all other claims or judgments arising out of the same incident or occurrence. 
c.  The insurance policies obtained by a permittee in compliance with this section shall be issued by a company or companies acceptable to the city and a current certificate or certificates of insurance, along with written evidence of payment of all required premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the city during the term of the permit. The policies shall name the city as an additional insured and shall contain a provision that written notice of cancellation or reduction in coverage of the policy shall be delivered by registered mail to the city at least 30 days in advance of the effective date thereof. 
d.  An applicant for a permit shall be required to submit evidence of liability insurance. 
K.  Revocation or suspension; emergencies. 
1.  The approval of a sidewalk café permit is conditional at all times. A sidewalk café permit may be revoked or suspended if it is found that: 
a.  Any necessary business or health permit has been suspended, revoked or canceled. 
b.  The permittee does not have insurance which is correct and effective in the minimum amounts described in this section. 
c.  The permittee exceeds the approved number of seats by placing additional tables, chairs, et cetera, in or beyond the approved area. 
d.  The permittee has failed to correct violations of this Code or conditions of this permit within 24 hours of receipt of the director's notice of such violations delivered in writing to the permittee. 
2.  If the permittee fails to remove any tables, chairs and other objects related to sidewalk café within 48 hours of receipt of the chief of police or designee final notice of revocation or suspension, the chief of police or designee shall have the right to remove such objects. 
3.  If a permittee is found in violation of the Code and given a written citation on three occasions in a single year as identified as the beginning date of the permit issuance, the sidewalk café permit shall be suspended for a period of time or revoked as determined by the chief of police or designee, effective immediately upon receipt of a third violation. In addition, if the chief of police or designee believes that a permittee has engaged or is engaged in conduct warranting the suspension or revocation of the permit, the chief of police or designee shall serve the permittee by certified mail or hand delivery at his business address as disclosed in the application for the permit or at the permitted premises, a written administrative complaint which affords reasonable notice of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action. The permittee shall be given adequate opportunity to request an administrative hearing before the code enforcement board unless the chief of police or designee finds that an emergency condition exists involving serious danger to public health, safety or welfare, in which case advance notice and hearing shall not be required. In the case of an emergency suspension or revocation, the permittee shall immediately be advised of the chief of police or designee's action and afforded a prompt post-suspension or revocation hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Code. Appeals of applications or café seating plans rejected by the city may be heard by the city council for either upholding the decision of the chief of police, further revising and approving the plan or approving the submitted plan.

DIVISION 21. - LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS 

3.21.1. - City council final authority. 
    The legislative body of the city is the city council, and has the final authority and responsibility for the adoption and enforcement of regulations for the development of land which are based on, related to, and are a means of implementation for the adopted comprehensive plan required by the laws of this state. 
A.  Supplemental procedure. In the adoption of the land development regulations, amendments thereto, including the zoning ordinance or general zoning code, and under such zoning ordinance or code, approval/denial decisions of any zoning, rezoning, planned unit development, variance, special exception, conditional use or other development order, no procedure set forth in this article, "zoning regulation" shall be exclusive nor prohibit such adoption, amendment, modification or approval/denial by the city council, proceeding in conformity with F.S. §§ 166.041(3)(c)1 and 166.041(3)(c)2, with recommendation of the local planning agency; however, without mandatory review by any land development regulation commission. 
DIVISION 22. - MIXED USE DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

3.22.1. - General provisions. 
A.  Relationship to other land development code chapters. The standards in this division apply to properties shown on the city's future land use map as mixed use and identified in the comprehensive plan as a mixed use district. If there are conflicts between these standards and standards contained elsewhere in the land development code, the standards in this division shall prevail. Development aspects not covered by these standards shall be governed by the standards contained elsewhere in the land development code. 
B.  Purpose. 
1.  The standards are intended to enable creation of functional mixed use communities consisting of pedestrian and transit-oriented centers of commerce and employment that support and are supported by walkable residential neighborhoods. 
2.  The following planning principles serve as a guide for interpreting and implementing the standards contained herein. The principles are the basis for the city's mixed use policies and they are organized by the scale at which they are functionally relevant. 
a.  Community scale principles. 
1)  Neighborhoods and centers are compact, pedestrian-oriented and transit-accessible places designed to reduce over-reliance on automotive based travel. 
2)  Centers, having a mix of uses, are the primary urban form for accommodating commercial, office, industrial and institutional development. Special districts established to accommodate a single use are the exception. 
3)  Ordinary activities are conveniently accessible by walking or transit, allowing independence to those who cannot or choose not to drive. 
4)  Interconnected networks of streets are designed to disperse traffic and reduce the length of automobile trips. 
5)  A range of housing types and price levels is available within neighborhoods to accommodate diverse ages and incomes. 
6)  Transit supportive building densities and land uses are provided within walking distance of transit stops. 
7)  Civic, public, and private institutional and commercial activities are embedded in mixed use centers, not isolated in remote single-use complexes. 
8)  A range of civic spaces, including parks, squares, and playgrounds are distributed within neighborhoods and centers. 
b.  Block and building scale principles. 
1)  Buildings and landscaping contribute to the physical definition of streets as public spaces. 
2)  Development respects the pedestrian and the spatial form of public areas, while adequately accommodating the automobile. 
3)  The design of streets and buildings reinforces safe pedestrian environments, with building frontages oriented to the street. 
4)  A visual scale is established for each center and neighborhood and coordinated through a consistent application of building form standards. 
5)  Civic buildings and public gathering places are provided at locations that reinforce community identity. 
6)  Civic buildings are distinctive and appropriate to their role of importance within the community. 
C.  Concept plans and site development plans. 
1.  The comprehensive plan directs that: 
a.  Implementation of the conceptual master plan for a mixed use district be through the preparation and approval of a concept plan and site development plan; and 
b.  Adjustments to a conceptual master plan shall become final through approvals of concept plans and site development plans. 
2.  The comprehensive plan further prescribes policies that these standards are intended to implement, which include: 
a.  The build out of lands within a mixed use district should occur in a manner that is predictable, but also flexible; and 
b.  Uses, densities, and intensities in a mixed use district shall be allowed to change over time, evolving in order to realize buildout targets. 
3.  For a mixed use district designated as a multimodal transportation district (MMTD), the city will review and approve concept plans and site development plans consistent with the following principles (among other principles): 
a.  Within a MMTD, a concept plan or a development order (if the concept plan also functions as a detailed specific area plan (DSAP) pursuant to F.S. § 163.3245) may vary by up to 25 percent from the overall densities and intensities dictated by a conceptual master plan. In establishing densities and intensities under this provision, the following shall apply: 
1)  The concept plan shall identify the proposed densities and intensities by reference to affected centers and neighborhoods. The proposed program shall be evaluated based on: 
i.  The development program's consistency with the FLUE mixed-use policies; and 
ii.  The project's enabling of transit, jobs creation, and walkability within the district's urban and community centers. 
2)  Development within urban, employment, community, and neighborhood centers, or within one-quarter mile of rail stations, stations along bus rapid transit routes in exclusive bus-only lanes, and/or transit superstops, having diminished densities and intensities shall be developed to allow evolution of the developments to original densities and intensities. The site development plan shall clearly illustrate how this will be accomplished, through a series of site designs showing the sequence of development activity over time. 
3)  Project designs will incorporate the walkability principles contained in these standards and maintain consistency with MMTD policies adopted for the area. 
D.  Chapter organization. The remainder of this division is organized as follows: 
1.  Public realm standards. This section presents design specifications for establishing and creating public spaces, which include streetscapes and civic spaces. 
2.  Place type functions. This section directs different types of activities or uses to the appropriate place type, consistent with its defined function. Minimum percentages of uses within a place type are set forth for the purpose of ensuring a robust mixture of compatible activities. 
(Ord. No. 2015-04 , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2015) 
3.22.2 - Place type function. 
A.  Regulation of place type function. The requirements of this section regulate place type functions by establishing broad categories of use and requiring their coordination with the building forms required to be identified in each site development plan. Use categories provide a systematic basis for combining mutually supportive and complementary activities so they can be managed appropriately. The intent is not to limit uses, but to allocate them to the appropriate place types. Use requirements are outlined for the place types discussed below. 
B.  Employment center (EC). 
1.  An employment center functions as a regional jobs center, as well as the principal work place for a mixed use district. A center contains high-intensity uses that are designed to meet the needs of a diversifying economy, while maintaining a pedestrian orientation and providing a high level of connectivity to adjacent residential neighborhoods and commercial centers. It is accessible to all modes of travel, to include regional serving facilities capable of providing access to other major employment and commercial centers in the region. 
2.  Vertical and horizontal mixed use is allowed. Individual use categories and the minimum percentages to be achieved at buildout, as calculated by developable area square footage, are shown below. The minimums, as they apply to a specific mixed use district, may be modified through the conceptual master plan (CMP), or the development of regional impact (DRI) processes. All modifications shall ensure a mix of uses consistent with the purpose of the place type. 
a. Residential 10% b. Commercial/office/ 
industrial 65% c. Public/park/civic 10%  
C.  Urban center (UC). 
1.  An urban center is the location for regional-scale commercial uses having a trade area extending outside the mixed use district. An urban center is generally served by one or more multimodal corridors and contains a diverse mix of commercial, office, business, residential, and public, park and civic uses. This type of center has a structure and character resembling traditional downtowns. The buildings should be sized to allow for a rich mixture of building types and sizes that can contribute to a center's vitality and sustainability. 
2.  Vertical and horizontal mixed use is allowed, with individual use categories and the minimum percentages to be achieved at buildout, as calculated by developable area square footage, shown below. The minimums, as they apply to a specific mixed use district, may be modified through the CMP, or DRI processes. All modifications shall ensure a mix of uses consistent with the purpose of the place type. 
a. Residential 15% b. Commercial/office 55% c. Public/park/civic 10%  
3.  Urban centers are the preferred location for high schools. They shall be located adjacent to or within urban centers, served by planned transit stops or station(s), and co-located, where possible, with parks, recreation facilities, community centers, libraries and open space. Schools may offer alternative public realm standards as needed to comply with U.S. Department of Education, Florida Department of Education or Osceola County School Board requirements. The particulars shall be determined by waiver and shall be the minimum necessary for achieving compliance. 
D.  Community center (CC). 
1.  A community center contains vertical and/or horizontal mixed use, allowing for commercial, office, public, park, civic, and residential uses. The uses are specific to the civic and daily/weekly needs of the surrounding neighborhoods and the buildings and open spaces are sized to meet those needs. These centers are generally within a short travel distance for the majority of residents in the adjoining neighborhoods. 
2.  Individual use categories and the minimum percentages to be achieved at buildout, as calculated by developable area square footage, are shown below. The minimums, as they apply to a specific mixed use district, may be modified through the CMP processes. All modifications shall ensure a mix of uses consistent with the purpose of the place type. 
a. Residential 10% b. Commercial/office 40% c. Public/park/civic 10%  
3.  Community centers are the preferred location for middle schools. They shall be located adjacent to or within community centers, served by planned transit stops or station(s), and co-located, where possible, with parks, recreation facilities, community centers, libraries and open space. Schools may offer alternative public realm standards as needed to comply with U.S. Department of Education, Florida Department of Education or Osceola County School Board requirements. The particulars shall be determined by waiver and shall be the minimum necessary for achieving compliance. Multi-use trails shall connect middle schools to residential neighborhoods and open space systems. 
E.  Neighborhood center (NC). 
1.  A neighborhood center is an intrinsic part of a neighborhood and, as the name implies, is generally located at or near the neighborhood's geographic center. A mix of uses is appropriate and desirable-commercial, office, civic, and parks. At a minimum, park land and civic uses are present. By providing a focal point for local activity, a neighborhood center helps to define the neighborhood as a specific place. This sense of place can be reinforced by locating neighborhood centers and elementary schools adjacent to one another. Structures are built to fit into the scale and design of the neighborhood. 
2.  The area attributed to public/park/civic space shall be, at a minimum, 25 percent of the neighborhood center, as calculated by developable area square footage. 
3.  Elementary schools shall be located adjacent to neighborhood centers or centrally located to two to three neighborhoods to maximize walkability. Schools may offer alternative public realm standards as needed to comply with U.S. Department of Education, Florida Department of Education or Osceola County School Board requirements. The particulars shall be determined by waiver and shall be the minimum necessary for achieving compliance. Multi-use trails shall connect elementary schools to residential neighborhoods and open space systems. 
F.  Neighborhood type 1 (NH 1). 
1.  A neighborhood type 1 represents the predominant residential district type within the city's mixed use districts. The mix of housing types is oriented towards detached rather than attached units, and is served by a highly connected street system with sidewalks, and bikeways, with connections to transit facilities. Since neighborhoods consume the greatest amount of developed acreage, they act as the background matrix within which other place types fit. The permeability of this matrix-achieved through the highly connected grid street pattern-allows for movement supportive of the mixed use district's functional integrity. 
2.  Individual use categories and minimum percentages to be achieved at buildout, as calculated by developable area square footage, are shown below. The minimums, as they apply to a specific mixed use district, may be modified through the CMP or DRI. Where a buildout program has been established in a CMP or DRI, the percentages shown shall serve as a guide for evaluating deviations from such program. 
a. Residential 80% b. Public/park/civic 5%  
G.  Neighborhood type 2 (NH 2). 
1.  A neighborhood type 2 is a dense residential area where the focus is on attached housing types rather than detached housing types. The densities are intended to support transit, as well as adjacent commercial and employment centers. It can provide a transition-in terms of building form-between employment, urban and community centers and type 1 neighborhoods. It has a wide range of building types, such as townhouses, row houses, and apartments, and to a lesser extent patio homes, single-family homes and cottages. 
2.  Individual use categories and minimum percentages to be achieved at buildout, as calculated by developable area square footage, are shown below. The minimums, as they apply to a specific mixed use district, may be modified through adoption of a CMP or through the DRI process. The percentages shown shall serve as a guide for evaluating deviations from the minimums. 
a. Residential 80% b. Public/park/civic 5%  
H.  Open space (OS). 
1.  Open space represents a place type where character is defined by the civic and public purposes it implements. It may encompass regional, community and neighborhood parks, natural resources (wetlands, habitat protection areas), stormwater facilities, nature centers and wildlife observation places to include trails, boardwalk, piers, pavilions and gardens. This place type defines and connects neighborhoods and centers throughout a mixed use district and functions as a greenway and green infrastructure system. 
2.  Any improvements involving construction of a building or an activity-based park within the open space district shall require review and approval of a site development plan for the area to be improved. Site development plans are not required for passive recreational improvements such as trails and boardwalks having minimum impact to the landscape. 
3.  Lands identified as open space in a CMP and designated for preservation shall be preserved in perpetuity through recordation of conservation easements consistent with F.S. § 704.06 with allowance for boundary adjustments based on site-specific conditions. The easements must be effective before or concurrent with the effective date of the final plat. 
I.  Special district. 
1.  A special district is a place type intended to serve one of two purposes. The first purpose is to set aside an area for activities providing an essential function, but which should not or cannot be mixed with other types of development because of their operations or expansive space needs. These include industrial operations, airports, correctional facilities, cemeteries, distribution centers, production facilities and major public utilities. The second purpose is to accommodate an economic catalyst. Special districts established for this second purpose are to be limited in number and in size, so as not to undermine the economic viability of a district's employment center or urban center. 
2.  An economic catalyst is an entity-educational, medical, research or business-capable of stimulating growth of basic businesses and industries within the larger mixed-use district. A special district established as an economic catalyst shall be designed and constructed in a manner that allows it to evolve into an employment center where feasible. The site development plan shall clearly illustrate how this will be accomplished, through a series of site designs showing the sequence of development activity over time. 
3.  The public realm standards contained herein shall be appropriately adjusted to accommodate the development program approved for a special district. The changes to the standards shall be outlined in either the concept plan or site development plan. 
(Ord. No. 2015-04 , § 1(Exh. A), 5-14-2015) 
3.22.3 - Public realm standards. 
A.  Purpose. This section sets forth development standards for the two types of public spaces that make up the public realm-the streetscape and civic space. As the public realm is the principal area for public movement, land use access and linkages, its design is key to creating a functional environment that promotes walkability and supportive of various modes of transit. 
B.  Streetscape. Figure 3.22.3a depicts the streetscape's design elements, which consist of the public right-of-way and the private frontage. 
    For regulatory purposes, the public right-of-way is subdivided to include the following: turn lane/median; travel lane; bike lane; parking; parkway; and sidewalk. Tables 3.22.3a-e identify the dimensional requirements for each of these elements by roadway type. As shown in the tables, application of the requirements may change to reflect the relationship between the roadway and the place type fronting it. Table 3.22.3a shows the dimensional requirements for private frontages associated with each place type. 
    Unless noted otherwise, the dimension shown in the tables represent both the minimum and maximum requirement. In addition, for purposes of these standards, the "frontage" of a building is defined as the surface of an exterior wall which faces a public right-of-way other than an alley or lane.

Weather protection features shall provide continuous sidewalk coverage for the length of the building, where feasible. 
6)  Awnings or overhangs shall project a minimum of six feet and maintain a clear height of at least eight feet. They may encroach upon the public sidewalk subject to a right-of-way encroachment permit. 
7)  A building's primary entrance shall be located on the facade facing the public right-of-way or civic space. Primary entrance is the principal pedestrian access to a building, even if customers or residents may more frequently use a secondary entrance associated with a garage, parking area, driveway or other vehicle use area. The entrance shall have the architectural detailing that sets it apart from other entrances and allows it be recognized as the building's primary access point. 
8)  Along the primary street within urban and employment centers, buildings shall be at least three stories in height. Along the primary street in community and neighborhood centers, building height shall be at least two stories in height. Limited exceptions may be made by waiver as a way to add variety and architectural interest to a center. Primary street is defined as the principal commercial street within a center. All other streets are considered secondary. 
9)  One-story buildings shall not exceed 125,000 square feet. 
10)  Buildings higher than three stories shall use stepbacks, balconies or other architectural treatments to decrease their apparent size and scale. 
c.  Street screen. A street screen not less than six feet in height or greater than 12 feet in height shall be required along any private frontage that is not otherwise occupied by a building. The street screen shall consist of a wall constructed of material matching or complementary to that of the adjacent building facades. A wall may be replaced by a hedge or fence (or combination) providing comparable level of screening. Residential lots within neighborhood type 1 are exempt from this requirement.

2)  Windows shall be slightly recessed or project as bays from the main wall of the facade so as to create texture and shadows on the facade for visual interest, as well as the perception that people or activities are behind the windows. 
3)  Upper floor residential units must have a visible ground floor entrance facing the front or side street, a civic space, or a pedestrian passageway. This may be a common entrance serving multiple units. 
e.  Parking and service/loading areas. 
1)  Parking and service/loading areas shall be accessed by a rear alley, rear lane, shared driveway or local street other than a primary street within centers. 
2)  Within neighborhoods, lots fronting on a framework street shall be accessed by a rear alley or rear lane. 
3)  Off-street surface parking areas and service/loading areas shall be screened from the public right-of-way by liner buildings or a street screen. 
4)  Structured parking and surface parking entries and driveways within all centers shall be located at least 75 feet away from any block corner or another garage or parking area entry on the same side of the same block.

Entries to structured parking or delivery bays shall have a maximum clear height of 16 feet and a maximum clear width of 22 feet. 
f.  Signage. 
1)  Signs shall be scaled to the character of the center or neighborhood; for pedestrians and slow-moving vehicular traffic in centers; and for simple, unobtrusive wayfinding in other areas of a mixed use district. 
2)  The total area of all signage for each building frontage may not exceed one and one-half square feet for each foot of lineal street frontage. Temporary signs shall not be included in the total area calculation. 
3)  Flush-mounted signs shall be no larger than 60 square feet; may not project more than eight inches from a building wall; and must be located no higher than 20 feet above the sidewalk, below the sill line of the second floor windows, or below the lowest point of the roof, whichever is lowest. In addition, one building identification sign is permitted per building facade. A building identification sign shall be no more than 100 square feet, may be mounted above the second story for maximum viewing, and shall consist of individual letters and/or graphic elements applied directly to the building facade. An address sign no more than two square feet in size is permitted at each address. 
4)  Wall plaques of up to six square feet and projecting no more than three inches from a building wall are permitted proximate to building entryways. 
5)  Monument signs are permitted. 
6)  Blade signs (perpendicular to the BTL) not more than six square feet, minimum nine feet clear height above the sidewalk, may be hung below the second-story level, from the facade or from an overhang or awning. Blade signs in the form of banners may be hung at least 14 feet above the sidewalk and not above the third story so long as such banners do not project more than three feet into the public right-of-way. 
7)  Awnings and canopies may include logos on the valance or front plain. Signs may be suspended from awnings or canopies so long as an eight-foot clear height is maintained. 
8)  No more than 25 percent of a window may be covered by signage. 
9)  Temporary sidewalk easel signs of up to 36 inches in height by 24 inches in width are permitted within that part of a building facade setback from the BTL. 
10)  The following signs are prohibited: billboards, roof signs and freestanding pole signs. 
11)  All illumination of signs and buildings shall be by constant light-digital, scrolling, flashing, traveling, animated or intermittent lighting shall not be mounted on the exterior of any building. 
g.  Lighting. Appropriate lighting is desirable for nighttime visibility, crime deterrence and decoration. Lighting that is too bright or intense creates glare, hinders night vision and creates light pollution. It is the intent of these standards to provide outdoor lighting that contributes positively to the pedestrian-oriented environment of urban centers and urban neighborhoods. Dark sky principles are not required. 
1)  Street lights shall preserve the ambiance of the night and respect the privacy of neighboring properties by applying pedestrian-scaled fixtures. Light poles shall be no higher than 18 feet. 
2)  Lighting elements shall provide full spectrum light so that colors at night are natural and realistic. Lighting elements that cast a clearly/perceptively unnatural spectrum of light (such as low-pressure sodium) are prohibited. 
h.  Street trees. 
1)  All roadways shall be lined with rows of trees, with each block and its facing block planted in a single species with shade canopies of a height that, at maturity, begin higher than the top of the second story of buildings. The following canopy trees are approved for use: Live Oak; Nuttall Oak; Magnolia; Winged Elm; Tabebuia ipe. 
2)  Trees shall be located within the parkway and medians of the public right-of-way, with the exception that trees are not required in the median of a center's primary street. 
3)  Trees shall be planted along an alignment line-generally three to three and one-half feet from the back of the curb at an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center. Where necessary, spacing allowances may be made to accommodate curb cuts, fire hydrants and other infrastructure elements. This allowance for spacing may not exceed 45 feet on center except where necessary for transit stops or stations. 
4)  Trees shall be at grade or not greater than six inches in height above or below the sidewalk. Any unpaved ground area shall be planted with groundcover, flowering vegetation, or climbing vines, not to exceed 112 inches in height. 
5)  At planting, trees shall be at least two and one-half inches in diameter at designated breast height (DBH) and at least ten feet in overall height. 
6)  Trees must be "limbed up" as they gain appropriate maturity so as to not interfere with pedestrian or truck travel (minimum seven feet clear over the sidewalk and 14 feet over the travel of the street) and to maintain visibility. 
7)  Maintenance and replacement of trees is the responsibility of the property owner. 
i.  Landscape buffers. 
1)  Within a mixed-use district, landscape buffers shall not be allowed between place types, between adjacent neighborhoods or between buildings and roadways. 
2)  Landscape buffers may be provided along the boundary line of a mixed-use district to mitigate any potential conflicts with adjacent development. 
C.  Utilities. 
1.  All new utilities shall be placed underground in the public right-of-way, in easements within a private frontage or in rear service alleys. Their specific placement will be determined as part of the site development plan process. Above ground power lines are allowed within an alley or lane. 
2.  In furtherance of FLU Policy 1.2.12, the Natural Drainage Module shall serve as a menu of stormwater management techniques, appropriately calibrated for the development patterns intended for a specific mixed use district. 
D.  Civic space standards. 
1.  Civic space is the second element of the public realm regulated by this article. The development standards provide significant open space and recreational opportunities that are a spatial counter-point to the densities and intensities required of development in mixed use districts. These can be realized through a variety of spaces ranging from large regional and neighborhood-scaled parks to small pocket parks. The open space network will be serviced by an interconnected network of sidewalks, trails and paths for pedestrians and bicyclists alike, providing open space amenities accessible to all neighborhoods and centers within a district. 
The types of spaces allowed are illustrated in figure 3.22.3b. 
Figure 3.22.3b. Civic Spaces 

2.  Civic spaces shall adhere to the following standards: 
a.  Urban parks. 
1)  Description. Urban parks include open areas available for a variety of purposes, to include structured and unstructured recreation, commercial activity and other passive uses. 
2)  Character. These spaces have a formal urban character being defined by surrounding building frontages and adjacent tree-lined streets. The landscape consists of lawns, trees and shrubs and furnished with paths and benches and shade. Civic elements such as kiosks, open shelters, pergolas, playgrounds or fountains may be included. Parks shall be located within or proximate to centers. 
3)  Standards. 
i.  Width-N/A. 
ii.  Depth-N/A.

iv.  Civic events. 
b.  Plazas and greens. 
1)  Description. Plazas and greens are open areas available for civic purposes, commercial activities, passive recreation, and, for greens, unstructured active recreation. Numerous plazas and greens add to the vibrancy of centers and neighborhoods by creating the opportunity for casual public engagement. Building frontages define the space. Pocket plazas function in a similar manner and follow the same rules as the larger plazas. These smaller scaled spaces create more intimate places for seating or dining and provide a place where commercial and neighborhood activity can spill into. These plazas can also be used to create a formal space in front of a prominent building entrance. 
2)  Character. Plazas and greens are purposefully sited gathering areas designed with a percentage of paved surface area appropriate to their pedestrian traffic level. They shall be sufficient in number to provide enough shade to help mitigate the heat effect of the hardscape. Tables and chairs shall be provided. 
3)  Standards. 
i.  Minimum width and depth-25 feet. 
ii.  Maximum width and depth-125 feet. 
iii.  Must front on at least one public roadway. 
4)  Typical uses. 
i.  Casual seating. 
ii.  Commercial uses (e.g., retail and food kiosks). 
c.  Squares. 
1)  Description. Squares provide an important anchor for a center or neighborhood, serving as an open space available for civic purposes, commercial activity, unstructured recreation and other passive uses. The square should have an urban, formal character and be defined by the surrounding building frontages and adjacent tree-lined streets. 
2)  Character. All buildings adjacent to the square must front onto it. Adjacent streets lined with appropriately scaled trees help to define the square. The landscape shall consist of lawns, trees, and shrubs planted in formal patterns and furnished with paths and benches. Shaded areas for seating shall be provided. A civic element or small structure such as a kiosk, open shelter, pergola or fountain may be included. 
3)  Standards. 
i.  Minimum width-120 feet. 
ii.  Minimum depth-120 feet. 
iii.  Must front on at least two public roadways. 
4)  Typical uses. 
i.  Unstructured and passive recreation. 
ii.  Commercial and civic uses. 
iii.  Casual seating. 
d.  Playgrounds. 
1)  Description. Playgrounds are open areas designed and equipped for the recreation of children. They can be interspersed within neighborhoods or centers. Playgrounds can be freestanding or located within urban parks. 
2)  Character. Playgrounds serve as safe places protected from the street and typically in locations where children do not have to cross framework streets to get to. Often playgrounds, particularly tot-lots, are located in the center of blocks surrounded by residential areas. 
3)  Standards. 
i.  Minimum width-N/A. 
ii.  Minimum depth-N/A. 
iii.  Independent of building frontages. 
iv.  Fenced with limited access points. 
4)  Typical uses. 
i.  Passive/active recreation. 
ii.  Picnic facilities. 
iii.  Outdoor seating. 
iv.  Play structures, interactive art, fountains. 
e.  Pedestrian passageways. 
1)  Pedestrian passageways provide pathways between buildings and through-blocks. They create unique spaces for building frontages to access while allowing for social and commercial activity to spill into the public realm. 
2)  Character. Passageways are hardscape areas with frequent entries and frontages. There may be exterior stairways to adjacent buildings that frame and define the passageway. There are minimal plantings and potted plants. 
3)  Standards. 
i.  Minimum width-12 feet. 
ii.  Maximum width-35 feet. 
iii.  Uninterrupted pedestrian passageways greater than 150 feet in length must incorporate a pocket plaza. 
iv.  Pedestrian passageways shall be incorporated into blocks that are longer than 400 feet in length in urban centers. 
4)  Typical uses. 
i.  Primary access. 
ii.  Casual seating.

DIVISION 23. - NARCOOSSEE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INTENT AND STANDARDS 

3.23.1. - Open space. 
A.  Framework. The open space framework builds on existing recreational amenities such as East Lake Tohopekaliga, the Split Oak Forest Conservation Park, Chisholm Park, Lake Runnymede Conservation Area and the Narcoossee Community Center and is focused on the preservation of existing resources, wildlife corridors and habitat areas. A primary regional trail system links these existing amenities, with new planned parks and cultural amenities. Secondary off-street trails will connect neighborhoods to this primary regional trail system, and detached sidewalks and bike lanes along road rights-of-way will serve as local connections throughout the Narcoossee area. 
    Parks, open space and trails increase quality of life, and can enhance property values in Narcoossee and throughout the region. The preservation of open space and natural resources ensures a sustainable ecosystem for Narcoossee's diverse vegetation and wildlife species. Trail systems allow a higher quality of life for residences and offer off-street transportation options and recreational opportunities that could extend into Orange County, south to Lake Lizzie Natural Area and eventually to Harmony. Open space standards and trails are addressed in more detail in Chapter 4 of the Land Development Code and are identified on Map 4.7.13 [sic]. 
B.  Open space goals and objectives. The open space guidelines are needed to preserve the natural resources of the area, while allowing for recreational uses throughout and are oriented towards four primary objectives: 
 Preserve the natural resources of the area; 
 Create destinations for recreation; 
 Establish an efficient and safe trail system to connect these destinations; and 
 Serve a range of users, including hikers, bicyclists and equestrians. 

C.  Open space overall context. The western edge of the Narcoossee study area is bounded by East Lake Tohopekaliga and Fell's Cove and their associated wetlands. Many additional lakes, including Lake Runnymede, Center Lake, and Hinden Lake are scattered throughout the area, connected by large-scale wetlands systems. 
    Much of the Narcoossee community is heavily vegetated with wetlands and forested areas. While many of these natural areas are smaller and disconnected west of Narcoossee Road, eastern areas boast large expanses of undisturbed wetland forests. 

D.  Open space opportunities. 
1.  Preservation of natural resources. Preservation of the natural systems for the Narcoossee community is considered a core community value. Built on the wetland system, this natural framework helps maintain the open, rural feeling. Opportunities are present for each landowner to be a steward of the natural resources for their property. Other opportunities exist to connect these sensitive areas with additional upland corridors so wildlife can move freely through the area. Wildlife corridors have been planned on adjacent mixed use districts. These wildlife corridors could make connections all the way from East Lake Tohopekaliga to the Econlockhatchee River. These areas will serve additional functions including interpretation; preserving water quality, detention, and retention; and simply reinforcing character features. Key areas of opportunity include: 
 Wetlands 
 Sensitive wildlife areas 
 Floodplain areas 
 Upland wildlife corridors 
 Historic areas 
 Public lands 
 Water bodies 

2.  Open space, parks and greenway networks. Preservation of natural systems is important to the character of the Narcoossee area, and the benefits of this are described throughout this section. These areas also provide the framework for a greenway, parks and trail system, linking the community together within a natural fabric. As demonstrated in the open space framework map in chapter 4, new parks, the Historic Town, the Narcoossee Elementary and Middle Schools and public lands are planned and connected into one system. Key opportunities include: 
 Regional park system and facilities 
 Lakeside parks 
 Public plazas 
 Community gardens 
 Beach areas with marina/boat slips and water access 
 Recreation center 
 Playgrounds 
 Tree preservation 
3.  Multi-use trails. Adjacent to natural features and greenways is a system of multimodal trails. These trails provide an appropriate buffer between sensitive resources and adjacent development. These trails allow for equestrian use, walking and biking. Trails have been located in strategic areas including within mixed use areas, along existing streets and adjacent to natural features. New trails in the Narcoossee community provide the opportunity to achieve the following: 
 Reinforce the character by promoting a historically used transportation system; 
 Buffer new development with a recreation amenity; 
 Create a new mobility option that supports equestrian, walking and biking; 
 Connect neighborhoods with trail systems to the Historic Town, schools, centers and regional destinations such as the Split Oak Mitigation Park and the Econlockhatchee River; 
 Provide safe and healthy options for seniors and our youth; 
 Create a new off-street trail amenity that helps mitigate the impact of busy roads. 
a.  Trailheads. Trailheads are public places to enter and exit a trail facility, and often include signage, informal kiosks with trail maps, and trash receptacles. 
There are three types of trailheads: trailheads with parking, trailheads with equestrian trailer parking, and non-parking access points. Trailheads that offer parking are typically near heavily utilized trails. The amount of parking offered at these trailheads is dependent on trail usage and available space. Non-parking access points are typically located on lesser-used trail systems. 
Following are the elements that should be located at each trailhead: 
  Signage. Rules and regulations shall be located at all trailheads, and shall include trail etiquette, warnings about potential safety hazards, and permitted trail uses. 
  Trash receptacles. Trash cans shall be located at all city-maintained trailheads and shall be placed along heavily used trails within the Narcoossee area. 
  Dog waste disposal stations. On trails where dogs are allowed, dog waste stations shall be provided at one-mile intervals and at trailheads. 
  Shade structures. Where possible, shade structures shall be located at heavily utilized trailheads to offer relief from the sun and shelter from inclement weather. 
  Lighting. In areas likely to receive use at night, pathway lighting meeting dark sky standards shall be provided to avoid conflicts at intersections and allow users to better observe trail direction, surface conditions and obstacles. 
  Restrooms. Where possible, restrooms shall be present at heavily utilized trailheads. 
b.  Trail crossings. Trail crossings shall always be located perpendicular to the roadway, and shall be clearly marked. Crossings are encouraged to be located at signalized intersections, especially at major roadway crossings. If this is not feasible, a trail-user activated flashing yellow light shall be used at the crossing. These crossings shall also be striped, or utilize different paving methods to alert drivers to trail crossing locations. On local streets, trail crossings may be signed with only a stop sign. 

(Ord. No. 2015-04 , § 1(Exh. B), 5-14-2015) 
3.23.2. - Separators. 
    The Narcoossee area has a number of character areas consisting of traditional subdivisions to rural estates. The community has acknowledged that portions of the community will continue to grow. New mixed use districts are already expected in the area. In these transitioning areas, separators, transitions and connections can increase the compatibility of all future projects. These techniques come in many forms, from simply preserving and buffering natural features adjacent to new developments to promoting compatible densities on the edge of a development. 
    Although, one technique is to create a separation between developments, another technique is to connect them. By connecting existing neighborhoods to new neighborhoods, the difference between the two developments are lessened. Through greenway, park, trail and street connections, separate developments appear to be one development with a variety of housing types. Residents benefit from shared amenities and new transportation choices. Key actions and opportunities include: 
 Preserve and buffer natural features such as wetlands, forested areas and water bodies 
 Create setbacks and separation of uses 
 Utilize physical features such as trails, fencing, sidewalks, detention ponds and berms 
 Promote land uses solutions such as feathering, cluster development, height restrictions, stair stepping, and promoting similar densities at the edge of a new development 
 Connect new and existing neighborhoods using streets, greenways, parks and trails 

A.  Fencing. 
1.  Height. Fencing shall be a minimum of 30 inches in height along roadway rights-of-way; 42 inches against vertical drops greater than 24 inches; and 54 inches along equestrian trails. 
2.  Materials. Fencing shall be constructed of one of the following materials: wooden post and horizontal wire; pre-cast concrete post and rail; three-rail wooden fence; steel I-beam vertical posts with wooden rails; or Corten steel slatted fence. 

B.  Berms. Berms and plantings shall be used to create a buffer between Narcoossee Road and adjacent residential development. Where space is not adequate to provide berming, other structures such as hedges and/or fences shall be used to create a screen, with associated plantings located on the Narcoossee Road side of the structure. 
1.  Berms shall be constructed in a non-contiguous fashion, with breaks between berms at appropriate locations (i.e., trail connections to interior neighborhoods, detention pond locations). 
2.  Slopes and overall form are to be natural and smooth; with irregular, organic forms; rounded tops; and varied side and bottom slopes, transitioning gently into adjacent grades. 
3.  Berm height shall be a minimum of six feet and determined by right-of-way width available and adjacent usage and sight lines. 
4.  Berms shall be completely covered with grass, shrubs or other living ground cover. Landscaping shall be used to give additional screening height where necessary and to provide a visually aesthetic treatment to the roadside. 


*Graphic intended to illustrate use of berm, and is not intended to enforce any cross-sections. Required
cross-section standards are addressed in chapter 4. 
C.  Natural features. Preserve existing native vegetation and features where possible, and utilize these areas as buffers between incompatible developments. Wetlands shall be preserved and buffered per the requirements in the Osceola County Comprehensive Plan. Historic trees shall be protected as stated within the Osceola County Land Development Code. 
D.  New physical features. Built features such as detention ponds, berms, greenways and trail systems and right-of-way elements such as sidewalks and fencing shall also be utilized as separators between incompatible developments. 
E.  Land use solutions. Land use options such as cluster development and transitioning densities at the edges of existing residential areas can help maintain the Narcoossee community character. Additionally, connections between existing and new residential neighborhoods using greenways and trail systems and/or local street connections can also help mitigate undesirable elements such as larger roads and additional traffic. 

(Ord. No. 2015-04 , § 1(Exh. B), 5-14-2015) 
3.23.3. - Centers framework. 
    The economic development framework for Narcoossee highlights opportunities for consolidating, expanding and creating new commercial areas along the Narcoossee corridor and interior to new walkable neighborhoods. The centers framework is identified on map 3.12B below: 

    At the heart of the Narcoossee corridor is the Historic Town. This area will serve as the community and cultural center for residents of the area. 
    At the south end of the corridor lies the existing retail center anchored by Publix. With the opportunity for continued expansion along U.S. Highway 102, this area could serve as an employment base for the community. 
    Two additional future community centers lie at the intersections of Narcoossee Road and Cyrils Drive, and Narcoossee Road and Rummell Road. These centers are anticipated to contain a mix of retail and small businesses to complement the southern commercial and employment center. 
    Additional future neighborhood-scale centers occur along Narcoossee Road at Boggy Creek Road, Tompkins Drive, and Chisholm Park Trail. Additional neighborhood centers also occur interior to the residential developments within the Narcoossee community. 
A.  Centers overall context. The Historic Town will establish a focus and identity for the Narcoossee community and will center around what could be considered Historic Narcoossee at the northeast corner of Narcoossee Road and Jones Road. This area sites almost at the geographical center for the Narcoossee community, already contains the historic fire station, and most lots are already divided into smaller parcels and zoned commercial, which is more applicable to development of a small downtown area. The Narcoossee Feed Store at the northwest corner of Narcoossee and Jones Roads should be preserved as well. It is recommended the St. Luke's Missionary Baptist Church, currently further east on Jones Road, be relocated to the Historic Town. 
The preservation of remaining historic buildings and structures in Narcoossee is an important consideration in establishing the Historic Town. This may involve the preservation, and in some case, physical relocation of historic buildings such as the Narcoossee Feed Store, the Narcoossee Schoolhouse, St. Luke's Missionary Baptist Church, the Volunteer Fire Department, and other historic buildings and structures in the area. 
The economic development framework for Narcoossee highlights opportunities for consolidating, expanding and creating new commercial areas along the Narcoossee corridor and interior to new walkable neighborhoods. 

B.  Centers opportunities. Residents do not want Narcoossee Road to suffer a similar fate as other corridors in the region. Instead of typical strip commercial development, a series of appropriately spaced and sized neighborhood and commercial centers will be developed. These walkable, unique centers will range from coffee shops to mixed use office complexes to new local restaurants. In key places, they will be surrounded by smaller residential units, creating new complete neighborhoods. Centers located in the mixed use districts will be adjacent to higher density development. A 2011 market analysis infers that long-term market demand exceeds the amount of zoned commercial and employment land, due to high traffic counts along Narcoossee Road and anticipated regional growth. These under-scaled, vibrant centers could experience high retail expenditure per square foot, promoting needed but tempered economic development. The existing commercial big box center at Highway 192 could be expected to transition to a mixed use area over time if adjacent residential densities are increased. Key opportunities include: 
 Creation of lakefront retail areas 
 Redevelopment of the Community Center at Highway 192 
 Creation of centers with senior living components, local restaurants and services 

C.  Historic Town opportunities. 

1.  Employment areas opportunities. Residents have expressed interest in new local jobs. When asked the question, "will my children live in the community when they grow older?", the majority answered "no". A primary reason is the lack of high-paying jobs. Most residents work outside the area. One method to minimize the impacts of growth is providing employment options closer to where people live. New employment areas are planned in the centers, mixed use areas or as a separation between the Narcoossee community and the northeast district. These businesses will provide new employment options to the residents. Key opportunities include: 
 New high-technology research facilities due to the proximity to Medical City and the northeast district 
 Office uses, creating appropriate entryways into the area 
 Sustainable industries that are consistent with the area's values 

2.  Investment in Historic Town opportunities. Residents have chosen to restore and expand the historic gathering place of the community. Historic Town will include mixed use commercial buildings against the street, a small-block quaint downtown, event area and the stabilization and enhancement of the adjacent residential neighborhoods. The development of Historic Town is expected to achieve the following goals: 
 Creation of a gateway into the community and Osceola County 
 Definition of the character and sense of place of the community 
 Creation of a central public gathering area and event areas 
 Provision of a center for local economic development 
 Provision of a local and regional recreational resource focused on equestrian amenities 
 Provision of a cultural center for the community, including a museum, art, local food production, and historic buildings 
 Provision of transit station options 
Key opportunities include: 
 Well-designed architectural details 
 Restaurants 
 Library and/or community centers 
 Churches and/or meeting areas 
 Public greens, plazas and farmer's market 
 Civic buildings/town hall 
 Amphitheater and/or public gathering spaces 
 Equestrian amenities 

D.  Historic Town goals and objectives. The Historic Town design guidelines are necessary to create a vibrant, small-scale town center, and are oriented towards five primary objectives: 
 Reflect the rural and agrarian context of the community; 
 Create places for gathering; 
 Enhance the existing identity in a cohesive way; 
 Establish a comfortable pedestrian environment; and 
 Plan for transit integration by including transit-oriented features. 

1.  Historic Town character areas. Within the Narcoossee Historic Town, four character areas exist that reflect differing types of use, walkability, road types and usage and transitions. These four zones are described as follows: 
Zone 1: Small Block Commercial is characterized by smaller, pedestrian-oriented blocks, narrower streets and central town square. 
Zone 2: The Narcoossee Road Transit-Oriented Design (TOD)/Commercial is the area that calls passerby's attention to the Small Block Commercial area. While the rest of the Narcoossee corridor is heavily landscaped, with little or no views to the interior neighborhoods, within this area the buildings will front the highway, creating a more active public space along Narcoossee Road. 
Zone 3: Town Residential make up the majority of the area surrounding the Small Block Commercial, and comprises the residential component of the Historic Town. While the block layout relies heavily on existing parcels and rights-of-way, the blocks range in size, with a maximum of 600 feet by 250 feet. A new street network through the area increases connectivity and enhances walkability. 
Zone 4: The Cultural/Commercial/Event Zone serves as the gathering area and the cultural center for Narcoossee. 

2.  Historic Town guidelines. 
a.  Zone 1: Small Block Commercial. 
1)  Small Block Commercial architecture.

Roofs. 
 Clerestory windows and/or dual-level roofs shall be used at second levels 
 Roof forms recalling those of barns, stables or agricultural facilities shall be used 

5)  Small Block Commercial building signage. 
Projecting or bracket-mounted signage. Bracket-mounted signage projecting from walls is an effective, historically-sensitive method to provide building signage for the Small Block Commercial area. These signs are more pedestrian in scale, typically mounted on pilasters or walls at a height closer to the sidewalk, and oriented perpendicular to the movement of pedestrians along the sidewalk, a more appropriate and sensitive solution than larger, flush-mounted signs oriented to the automobile. 
i.  Use projecting, bracket-mounted signage where possible. Signs should be affixed to, or hung from, brackets such that the bottom of the sign is at least eight feet above the sidewalk. 
ii.  Signs should not be mounted higher than 12 feet above the sidewalk, or project above the roof or parapet. 
iii.  Sign sizes, styles and mounting heights should be consistent and complementary in order to unify the streetscape. 
iv.  Modern signage designs are permitted provided the designs are compatible with the historic building. 
v.  Signs can be externally illuminated with small floodlights or similar fixtures, provided the lighting is directed back toward the sign and does not cause glare onto the street, sidewalk or sky. 
Flush-mounted and wall signage. Flush wall-mounted signage can also be an effective, historically sensitive method to provide building signage for the Historic Town. Sign placement, sizes and mounting heights are critical in ensuring the compatibility of this type of signage with the downtown streetscape. 
Small, flush-mounted signs should be pedestrian in scale, oriented to pedestrians along the sidewalk instead of to the automobile on the street. Wall-mounted directory signage can be used to identify tenants on upper floors, or in larger, multi-tenant buildings. 
i.  Use flush wall signage where bracket-mounted signage is not possible. Signs should be mounted at least eight feet above the sidewalk, but no higher than 12 feet. 
ii.  Sign sizes, styles and mounting heights should be consistent and complementary in order to unify the streetscape. 
iii.  Signs can be externally illuminated with small floodlights or similar fixtures, provided the light is directed back toward the sign and does not cause glare onto the street, sidewalk or sky. 
Modern signage designs are acceptable, provided the designs are compatible with the historic building. 
Awning and window signage. Both window signage and awning valance signage is pedestrian in scale and easily relates information to the visitor along the sidewalk. 
i.  Signage on awnings is permitted, either on the sloped body of the awning or on the valance. Valance signage is preferred for its more appropriate scale. 
ii.  Window signage is encouraged in conjunction with complementary wall- or bracket-mounted signs. 
iii.  Colors and styles for awning signs should be complementary to the awning fabrics. 
iv.  Awning signage should not be backlit. 
v.  Window signage should be in scale with the window area, not obstructing the view to the interior of the business. 

6)  Small Block Commercial building lighting. 
Facade lighting. Subtle facade lighting shall enhance the character and ambiance of the Small Block Commercial. Facade lighting can be used to supplement street lighting for improved pedestrian safety. Facade lighting can be used as lighting for wall-mounted signage. All lighting within the area shall meet dark sky requirements. 
Subtle wall-washing facade lighting shall be permitted within the Small Block Commercial. 
i.  Fixtures should be directed downward, with emphasis placed on the street level areas of the facade where the lighting will enhance pedestrian safety. 
ii.  Fixture styles, finishes and light source should be compatible with the scale and materials of the building facades, and complementary to awnings, signage and other features. 
iii.  Use of modern light fixtures is permitted, provided the placement and design is compatible with the character of the Small Block Commercial buildings. 

b.  Zone 2: Narcoossee Road TOD/Commercial. 
1)  TOD/Commercial architecture. 
Building size, massing and use. All buildings shall be built to a uniform frontage line to define the TOD/Commercial area and to distinguish it from the overall Narcoossee corridor. 
Building use. The TOD/Commercial area shall have a variety of uses including: housing, retail, commercial and office. 
Building size and massing. 
Lot/building sites. 
 Maximum building sites for residential and commercial uses shall be 15,000 square feet. 
 Maximum lot coverage shall be 100 percent. 
Building setbacks. 
 0 feet front build-to line.

 All encroachments may extend into the public sidewalk. 
2)  TOD/Commercial building lighting and signage. The TOD/Commercial area lighting and signage shall be designed similar to those described for the Small Block Commercial area. 
c.  Zone 3: Town Residential. Several areas adjacent to the Small Block Commercial, particularly north along Narcoossee Road, are underdeveloped and excellent candidates for redevelopment. A more intensive pattern of development in these transitional areas will provide the Historic Town with an enlarged population of customers, visitors and residents. New development in these areas should encourage mixed use, blending residential housing with traditional commercial and retail businesses and providing downtown live/work opportunities. New development should build on the pattern of one- and two-story buildings organized in traditional block faces, with buildings fronting tree-lined streets. 
Infill development within the transitional areas between the Small Block Commercial and rural residential areas to the east and south shall be more "urban" than "suburban" in character, with new buildings constructed to the sidewalks instead of set back with large expanses of lawn. Native landscaping shall be encouraged throughout the area, to reinforce Narcoossee's character. 
Design of building scale, massing, facade treatments, materials and details are encouraged to be similar to those recommended within the Small Block Commercial. 

d.  Zone 4: Cultural/Commercial/Event Zone. The Cultural/Commercial/Event Zone could include a small public square at a central location, with adjacent streets lined with street trees. As part of this square, an orange grove could be accommodated, or orange trees could line all sides of the square, to reinforce Narcoossee's agricultural history. Hitching posts could be placed around the square as well, separate from parking areas. 
A location should be identified and preserved for an equestrian/event center adjacent to the small block commercial, in order to support the retail uses within Historic Town and to support the equestrian community adjacent to the area. 
These grounds could serve as both event grounds as well as places for community gatherings such as farmers' markets. 
Design of building scale, massing, facade treatments, materials and details are encouraged to be similar to those recommended within the Small Block Commercial.

 Steamer ships 
 Equestrian 
 Orange groves 
 Sugar cane 
 Cattle brands 
 Turpentine industry 
 Railroad 
 Cowboy 
 Wildlife (sandhill cranes, alligators, black bear, fox, deer, turkey, etc.) 
 Natural resource elements (water, wetlands, pines, saw palmetto, wildflowers, etc.) 
All commercial and civic buildings built within the Small Block Commercial and Cultural/Commercial/Event Zones shall be required to fund or contribute to one public art project or historical site identification/markers within the area, related to the overall theme. 

E.  Community and Neighborhood Centers goals and objectives. Guidelines are needed to create vibrant, small-scale Community and Neighborhood Centers along the Narcoossee corridor, and are oriented towards the following objectives: 
 Reflect the agrarian context of the community along the Narcoossee corridor; and 
 Design centers that are interesting and express a different character than currently found in the nearby commercial areas of St. Cloud.

The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for establishing professional standards and providing advice on the preservation and protection of all cultural resources listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The standards apply to all proposed development grant-in-aid projects assisted through the National Historic Preservation Fund, and are intended to be applied to a wide variety of resource types, including buildings, sites, structures, objects, and districts. They address four treatments: preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction. N.B.: 36 CFR Part 67, focuses on "certified historic structures" as defined by the IRS Code of 1986. The "Standards for Rehabilitation" cited in 36 CFR 67 should always be used when property owners are seeking certification for federal tax benefits. 
    Setting. The physical environment of a property, including all landscape elements. 
    Site. The location of an event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archaeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure. 
    Street level. As it relates to building height, the street level is the first 15 feet of height. 
    Structure(s). A combination of materials to form a construction, generally used to distinguish from buildings, those functional constructions made for purposes other than creating human shelter; e.g., a bridge, wall, fence, or pond. Anything constructed, installed, or portable, the use of which requires a location on a parcel of land. It includes a movable structure while it is located on land which can be used for housing, business, commercial, agricultural, or office purposes either temporarily or permanently. Structure also includes fences, billboards, swimming pools, swimming pool decks, poles, transmission lines, and advertising signs. Structures can be accessory, temporary, or permanent.

3.24.4. - Certified local government review. 
    The city council will apply for certified local government (CLG) status with the intent to be approved by the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources. The city council as a CLG is required to participate in the Florida National Register of Historic Places nomination process, be involved in the Section 106 process of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and is eligible to receive grants from the CLG section of the Florida Department of State, Historical Resources Grants-In-Aid program. 
( Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 10-11-2018 ) 
3.24.5. - Unsafe buildings and structures. 
    Should the building official determine that a historic property or a property within a historic district is unsafe, the planning and zoning department staff and the HPB shall be notified of such findings. 
A.  Within applicable laws and regulations, the building official shall request that the resource be repaired rather than demolished and shall take into account any comments and recommendations provided by planning and zoning department staff or the HPB. The building official may take appropriate actions to effect and accomplish the preservation of the resource, including, but not limited to, negotiations with the owner and other interested parties, provided that such actions do not contradict with the Florida Building Codes. 
B.  In the case where the building official determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to the life, health, or property affecting a historic property or a property within a historic district and timely demolition is the only course of action, the building official may order the demolition and notify the planning and zoning department of the impending action. In this instance, a certificate of appropriateness will not be required and the HPB will promptly be notified of the action being taken. 
( Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 10-11-2018 ) 
3.24.6. - Exceptions for historic properties. 
A.  Waiver of technical requirements. The provisions of the technical codes relating to the construction, alteration, repair, enlargement, restoration, or moving of buildings may not be mandatory for those resources listed in the Historical and Architectural Survey, City of St. Cloud Project Report, May 1993 (as amended from time to time), the National Register of Historic Places, or the local historic register, when evaluated by a Florida registered architect or engineer and demonstrated to the building official to be safe and in the public interest of health, safety, and welfare. 
B.  Equivalent protection. Resources or portions thereof that do not strictly comply with the Florida Building Code may be considered to be in compliance, if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the building official that equivalent protection has been provided or that no hazard will be created or continued through noncompliance. Life, safety, and property conservation shall be in compliance with the 2014 5th Edition of the Florida Existing Building Code or as subsequently amended. 
C.  Accessibility. Alterations to resources listed in the Historical and Architectural Survey, City of St. Cloud Project Report, May 1993 (as amended from time to time). The National Register of Historic Places, or the local historic register may receive exemption from accessibility requirements, if the building official determines that compliance for accessible routes (exterior and interior), ramps, entrances, or toilets would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building. Alternative requirements mentioned in the 2014 5th Edition, Accessibility, of the Florida Building Code shall be utilized. 
D.  Administrative and board approval of zoning code variances. The responsibility for review and approval of an application for a variance in association for a certificate of appropriateness for alterations of resources listed in the Historical and Architectural Survey, City of St. Cloud Project Report, May 1993 (as amended from time to time), the National Register of Historic Places, or the local historic register will rest with city council. Such requests for variance shall be made on the standard application form for a standard site variance pursuant to Section 3.4.1 of the Land Development Code. 
E.  Sustainable building practices. The application of sustainable, energy efficient, and green building practices to improvements associated with historic properties is encouraged whenever they are compatible with best historic preservation practices. Whenever possible, equipment such as solar panels, wind generation devices, or mechanical equipment, etc., should not be affixed to the building but sited in rear or side yard locations and fully screened with landscaping, fencing, or wall barrier. When placement upon the building is unavoidable, such equipment, as well as skylights, shall be located on a noncharacter-defining elevation or roof slope that is not visible from the street. In no instance shall the equipment be allowed to be placed upon any character-defining feature. 
( Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 10-11-2018 ) 
3.24.7. - Designation of historic properties and districts. 
A.  Guidelines for historic designation-qualifications. To qualify, individual properties must be listed in the Historical and Architectural Survey, City of St. Cloud Project Report, May 1993 (as amended from time to time) or be listed in the National Register of Historic Places or is included in the Florida Department of State's Division of Historical Resources Master Site File. Additionally, and as determined by the HPB, it must have significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering or culture and possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, or association. For districts, eligibility is based on the establishment of historic contexts or themes which describe the historical relationship of the properties within the district. Individual buildings shall be at least 50 years old and, in the case of a district at least 50 percent of the buildings shall be at least 50 years old. In addition, buildings shall be significant in one or more of the following areas: 
1.  Listed in the National Register of Historic Places or included in the inventory in the Historical and Architectural Survey, City of St. Cloud Project Report, May 1993 or is included in the Florida Department of State's Division of Historical Resources Master Site File; 
2.  Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of the city's history; 
3.  Associated with the lives of persons significant in the city's past; 
4.  Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or represents the work of a master craftsman, or possesses high artistic or architectural values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose other components may lack individual distinction; 
5.  Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. 
B.  Properties not generally considered; exceptions. Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for a historic designation. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the following categories: 
1.  A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural, archaeological, cultural or artistic distinction or historical importance; 
2.  A building or structure removed from its original location but which is primarily significant for its architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; 
3.  A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site or building associated with his or her productive life; 
4.  A cemetery that derives its primary importance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; 
5.  A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived; 
6.  A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or 
7.  A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance. 
C.  Procedures for historic designations of properties and districts: 
1.  The city shall send a notice of proposed designation to the owner of the property in question at least 30 calendar days prior to the date of the public hearing. The city shall transmit to the owner the staff recommendations on the designation at least 15 calendar days prior to the public hearing. 
2.  The HPB shall hold a public hearing within 60 days after the filing of a complete application for designation is received. The meeting shall be publicly announced in accordance with section 3 of this division. 
3.  At the public hearing, the HPB shall either recommend approval or denial of the designation based on the criteria outlined in section 3.24.6.A of the land development code. 
i.  In the event the owner of a property or the owners of more than 50 percent of the property within a district object in writing to the proposed designation, either before or during the public hearing, then the application shall be withdrawn and not considered by the HPB at that time. All objections in writing must contain the notarized signature of the property owner(s). 
4.  The application will be scheduled for the next possible city council meeting. The city council will make a determination of designation after taking into account the recommendations of staff, the HPB, and affected property owners. 
D.  Removal of designation. A designation may be removed by the city council after considering the HPB's recommendation. Such recommendation shall be based upon new and compelling evidence and evaluation of work or natural cause producing an adverse effect to a property or district. The same guidelines and the same procedures established for designation shall be considered for the removal of the designation. 
E.  Designation of county, state, or other political subdivision properties. County, state, or political subdivision entity-owned properties may be recommended for designation as a historic property or district if such designation is not prohibited or preempted by law, or otherwise provided for in the intergovernmental coordination element of the comprehensive plan (as amended from time to time). In the absence of prohibition, preemption, or other agreement, such other government may only avoid designation of its property by bearing the burden of proof that public interests, on balance, are best served by avoiding such designation. Such determination shall be established by the process as set forth in this division. Once designated, unless reversed upon appeal, such designated property or district shall comply with and be regulated by all regulations contained in this division. 
F.  Maintenance and repair of designated properties; demolition by neglect prohibited 
1.  Ordinary maintenance or repair. Nothing in this division shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior elements of any building or structure that does not involve a change of design, appearance or material, and which does not require a building permit. 
2.  Affirmative maintenance required. The owner of a property designated pursuant to this chapter either individually or as part of a district or zone shall comply with all applicable codes, laws, and regulations governing the maintenance of the property. It is the intent of this section to preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect of the exterior features of such properties and the interior portions thereof when maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of the property. All such properties shall be preserved against decay and deterioration and shall be free from structural defects through prompt corrections of any of the following defects: 
i.  Facades that fall and injure the subject property, adjoining property or members of the public; 
ii.  Deteriorated or inadequate foundations, defective or deteriorated flooring or floor supports, deteriorated walls, or other vertical structural supports; 
iii.  Members of ceilings, roofs, and roof structures or other structural members that may rot, sag, split, or buckle due to defective material or deterioration; 
iv.  Deteriorated or ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations, or floors, including broken, unsecured or missing windows or doors; 
v.  Any fault or defect in the property that renders it structurally unsafe, insufficiently protected from weathering, or not properly watertight. 
G.  Nominations to the National Register of Historic Places. As part of the duties under the certified local government program, the HPB shall receive all nominations of local property for submission to the National Register of Historic Places following the regulations of the state historic preservation office. 
1.  Appropriate local officials, owners of record, and applicants shall be given a minimum of 30 calendar days and not more than 75 calendar days prior notice to HPB meetings in which to comment on or object to the listing of a property in the National Register of Historic Places. 
2.  Objections to being listed in the National Register of Historic Places by property owners must be notarized and filed with the state historic preservation officer. Within 30 days after its meeting, the HPB shall forward to the State Historic Preservation Officer its action on the nomination and the recommendations of the local officials. Appropriate local officials, the owner, and the applicant shall be notified of the HPB's action. 
3.  The state historic preservation officer will take further steps on the nomination in accordance with federal and state regulations. If either the HPB or the local officials, or both, support the nomination, the state historic preservation officer will schedule the nomination for consideration by the state review board for the National Register of Historic Places at its next regular meeting. If both the HPB and the local officials recommend that a property not be nominated to the National Register of Historic Places, the state historic preservation officer will take no further action on the nomination unless an appeal is filed with the state historic preservation officer. 
( Ord. No. 2018-57, § 1, 10-11-2018 ) 
3.24.8. - Certificate of appropriateness. 
    The HPB or planning and zoning department staff shall review actions affecting the exterior of properties and all resources, including noncontributing properties, within the district as well as properties on the local historic register within the city limits. If the actions are determined to meet all requirements for historic preservation, a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued. 
A.  Applying standards. In reviewing an application, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as may be amended from time to time, shall be applied. The current version is as follows: 
1.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site environment. 
2.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
3.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
4.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
5.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
6.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
7.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
8.  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
9.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction on the same parcel of land shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
10.  New additions or related new construction on a parcel of land adjacent to a historic property shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
B.  Additional criteria. The above points from the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation shall be supplemented by the following criteria specific to certain types of requests: 
1.  New construction and alterations. All new construction and alterations to existing buildings within a designated historic district or on an individually designated property shall be visually compatible, and meet the following guidelines, as determined by the HPB. 
i.  Setting, orientation and setbacks. The building should be situated approximately the same distance from the street as adjacent historic buildings, to create a continuous street edge. The orientation of the building should be visually compatible with that of the buildings in the historic district at street level. The setting should be designed with the overall environment in mind. It should take into account the compatibility of landscaping, parking, service areas, walkways, and accessory structures. 
ii.  Building height. The height of the building at street level, i.e., from a 15-foot perspective, should be visually compatible in comparison or relation to the height of the existing contributing buildings in the historic district. 
iii.  Design styles. New buildings should take their design cues from the prevailing architectural styles within the historic district. Traditional or contemporary design standards and elements should relate to the existing styles. 
iv.  Proportion of openings. The openings of any building within a historic district should be visually compatible with the openings in existing contributing buildings within the historic district. The relationship of the width of windows and doors to the height of windows and doors should be visually compatible with the existing contributing buildings within the historic district at street level. 
v.  Rhythm of solids to voids. The relationship between solids (walls) and voids (windows and doors) of a building should be visually compatible with the surrounding buildings at street level. 
vi.  Rhythm of spacing along the street. The relationship of buildings to the open space between them should be compatible with the other buildings on each side of the street in that block. 
vii.  Relationship of materials and textures. The materials and textures of a building should be chosen with the predominant materials of the historic district in mind, to the greatest extent possible. Simplicity in such use is preferable. 
viii.  Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building is a major distinguishing feature. The roof shape of a building should be compatible with the roof shape of existing contributing buildings within the historic district. The roof shape shall be consistent with the architectural style of the building, to the maximum extent possible. 
ix.  Size, scale, bulk, mass and volume. The physical size, scale, bulk, mass, and volume should be compatible with the existing contributing buildings within the historic district at street level, and where appropriate may be stepped back above 35 feet in building height. 
2.  Additions. All additions to historic structures or structures within a historic district shall meet the following guidelines, as determined by the HPB: 
i.  Locate an addition to the rear or least visible sides of historic structures. Locating an addition on the front elevation should be avoided. 
ii.  Minimize the loss of historic materials from the historic structure and protect character-defining architectural features. 
iii.  Design the addition to be compatible in terms of massing, size, scale, relationship of solids to voids, and architectural features. An addition should be subordinate to the historic building. 
iv.  Differentiate the addition from the historic structure. 
v.  If permitted, rooftop additions should generally be limited to one story in height, should be set back from the wall plane and should be as inconspicuous as possible. 
vi.  Continue the design elements on all elevations of the new construction, not only those elevations that can be viewed from the street. 
vii.  Design and construct the addition so that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic structure will be unimpaired. 
viii.  Limit the size and number of openings between the old and new building by utilizing existing doors or by enlarging existing windows. 
3.  Demolition. All demolitions of contributing historic structures within a historic district or structures on the local historic register within the city limits shall comply with the following: 
i.  Simultaneous certificates required. No building or structure on a property or located within an historic district shall be demolished without first receiving a certificate of appropriateness for new construction. The applications for demolition and new construction shall be reviewed by the HPB and by the planning and zoning department. The requirement of a certificate of appropriateness for new construction may be waived by the HPB upon a good cause showing that such requirement would be unduly harsh or would result in a substantial hardship to the property owner. 
ii.  A showing of good cause may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the property owner is unable to comply with the requirement for simultaneous new construction due to advanced age, infirmity, physical, or other debilitating handicap, or financial hardship. 
iii.  If an application for certificate of appropriateness for demolition is approved, the owner shall, at his/her expense, fully record the building prior to demolition. At a minimum, the owner shall provide an architectural description, floor plan with interior and exterior dimensions, interior and exterior photographs, and any other information requested by the HPB. Said record shall be deposited with the city clerk where it will be made available to the public. 
iv.  Upon approval by the HPB of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, the demolition permit shall not be issued until all demolition and new construction plans for the property have received all other required governmental approvals. 
v.  The existence of one or more of the following conditions may be the basis for denial of a demolition application: 
a.  The resource contributes significantly to the historic character of a designated property or district; 
b.  The resource is listed in the National Register of Historic Places; 
c.  The resource is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or city; 
d.  The resource is capable of being repaired and reused in a practical and feasible manner; 
e.  Retention of the resource would promote the general welfare of the city by providing an opportunity to study local history, architecture, and design, or by developing an understanding of the importance and value of a particular culture or heritage; 
f.  Granting a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition would result in an irreparable loss to the city of a significant resource; 
g.  The plans for the simultaneous new construction (if the demolition is granted) are not compatible with the property or district. 
4.  Demolition delay period. The HPB may grant a certificate of appropriateness for demolition which may contain a delayed effective date. The effective date will be determined by the HPB based on the relative significance of the resource and the probable time required to arrange a possible alternative to demolition. The HPB may delay demolition for up to three months. During the demolition delay period, the HPB may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve the resource. Such steps may include, but are not limited to: consultations with community groups, public agencies, and interested citizens; recommendations for acquisition of the property by public or private bodies or agencies; an exploration of the possibility of moving the resource. 
5.  Salvage and preservation of specific features. The HPB may require the property owner to salvage and preserve specified classes of building materials, architectural details, ornaments, fixtures and the like. 
6.  Authority to initiate designation. If an undesignated property warrants it and it is otherwise authorized under this code, planning and zoning department staff, the building official, or other city staff may initiate, or recommend that the HPB initiate the designation application and review process for demolition. They may further request that the HPB require that the issuance of a demolition permit be stayed pending the HPB's review of the application and the city council's decision to designate or deny designation of the property for demolition. However, the maximum period during which the issuance of a demolition permit may be stayed pursuant to this paragraph is 120 days, unless extended by the city council. If for any reason the designation process is not completed and the demolition application is approved, the owner shall, at his/her expense, fully record the building prior to demolition and attempt to salvage and preserve specified classes of building materials, architectural details, ornaments, fixtures, and the like. 
7.  Relocation. The existence of one or more of the following conditions may be the basis for denial of a relocation application: 
i.  The historic character or architectural elements of the resource contribute to its present setting in such a manner that relocation would result in a substantial loss to the setting or district; 
ii.  There are no definite plans for the area to be vacated; 
iii.  There are definite plans for the area to be vacated that may adversely affect the character of the district; 
iv.  The resource cannot be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; 
v.  The proposed relocation area is not compatible with the historic, cultural, and architectural character of the resource; 
vi.  Little or no effort has been made to consider relocation within the same district or within another district with compatible historic, aesthetic, cultural, or design qualities with the relocated resource. 
8.  Changes in approved work. Any change in the proposed work following the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall be reviewed by planning and zoning department staff. If the proposed change does not materially affect the historic character or the proposed change is in accordance with the HPB's decision, planning and zoning department staff may administratively approve the change. If the proposed change is not in accordance with the HPB's decision, a new certificate of appropriateness application for such change must be submitted for HPB review.

3.24.9. - Incentives for historic preservation. 
A.  General. 
1.  The granting of tax exemptions to owners who make improvements to historic properties was authorized by an amendment to the Florida Constitution and codified in F.S. §§ 196.1997 and 196.1998. The ad valorem tax exemption program was established by Osceola County in 1995 (Ordinance 95-41), and may be implemented in the city through an interlocal agreement with the county and a local tax abatement exemption ordinance. The tax abatement exemption ordinance authorizes granting exemptions from increases to ad valorem taxes for qualified improvements to qualifying properties. 
2.  Exemptions. Exemptions for historic properties are intended for the physical improvements necessary to preserve, rehabilitate, restore, or reconstruct the historic resource, which may include additions, alterations, or new construction. The improvements must comply with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. 
3.  Mutual procedures. The city and county will process the application following mutually established procedures through both the city council and county commission. This program will provide an exemption from tax increases on the improvements to the property for up to a ten-year period. The exemption is conveyed through a covenant that accompanies the deed of the property and may be transferred to future owners during the abatement period. 
B.  Tax exemption for historic properties. 
1.  The city council hereby creates a tax exemption for the appropriate preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, or reconstruction of qualifying historic properties designated herein. Qualifying property shall be exempt from that portion of ad valorem taxation levied by the city on 100 percent of the increase in assessed value resulting from any appropriate preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, or reconstruction of the qualifying property made on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derived for a period of up to ten years. 
2.  The above exemption does not apply to: 
i.  Taxes levied for payment of bonds; 
ii.  Taxes authorized by a vote of the electors pursuant to Section 9(b) (local taxes) or Section 12 (local bonds), Article VII (Finance and Taxation), of the Florida Constitution; or 
iii.  Personal property. 
C.  Qualifying properties and improvements. 
1.  The following real property in the city is a qualifying property for the purposes of this subsection if at the time the exemption is approved by the city council, the property: 
i.  Is individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; 
ii.  Is a contributing property to a national register-listed district; 
iii.  Is designated as a historic property, or as a contributing property to a historic district, under the terms of the city's historic preservation code; 
iv.  Has been determined by the HPB as satisfying the qualifications as set forth in section 3.24.6, designation of historic properties and districts. 
    The exemption does not apply to improvements made to noncontributing principal buildings or noncontributing accessory structures. 
2.  For an improvement to a historic property to qualify for a tax exemption, the improvement must: 
i.  Be consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as amended; 
ii.  Be determined by the HPB to meet criteria established in rules adopted by the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 1A-38, as amended; and 
iii.  Be consistent with any ordinance of the city designating the property as historic or designating the historic district in which the property is located. 
D.  Evaluation of property open to the public. Pursuant to F.S. tit. XIV, § 196.1998, if a historic property is used for non-profit or governmental purposes and is regularly open for the public's visitation, use, and benefit, the property is exempt from ad valorem taxation of up to 100 percent of the assessed value of the property, as improved, provided however that the assessed value of the improvement must be equal to at least 50 percent of the total assessed value of the property as improved. In order for the property to qualify for the exemption, improvements must be made on or after the day the ordinance granting the exemption is adopted. 
E.  Application for exemption; fees. An applicant desiring an ad valorem tax exemption for proposed improvements to a historic property must file a request accompanied by its corresponding fee and all documentation required by the application checklist. The request shall be made on the three-part Historic Preservation Property Tax Exemption Application, DOS Form No. HR3E101292, approved by the State of Florida, Division of Historical Resources and promulgated in accordance with Rule 1A-38, Florida Administrative Code, and include additional information and documentation of the cost of the qualifying improvement. Part 1 of the application, "Evaluation of Property Eligibility," and Part 2, "Description of Improvements" shall be submitted before qualifying improvements are initiated. Part 3, "Request for Review of Completed Work," shall be submitted to the HPB and building department for review upon completion of the qualifying improvements. The request for review of completed work shall contain the historic preservation exemption covenant as established by the Department of State, Division of Historical Resources and applicable for the term for which the exemption is granted.

2.  If the HPB denies the appeal, the applicant may appeal the action of the HPB to the city council. 
D.  Issuance of other permits or approval. A certificate of appropriateness shall be considered a prerequisite to the issuance of any other permits required. The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits or approvals required by the city. 
    No certificate of occupancy or completion shall be issued by the city until the certificate of appropriateness application has been approved by either the HPB or city staff and all appeal proceedings have been completed. 
E.  Completion of work. An applicant must begin all work within two years following the date of approval of a certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness application shall be automatically revoked if the property owner has not completed work within two years after commencement of the work. 
    The HPB, upon the recommendation of the city, may extend the time for completion of a substantial improvement in accordance with the procedures of the city's building code. 
F.  Final application and request for review of completed work. For projects that determined eligible for tax exemption:

Appendix A-Historic Downtown District Designation Area and Map 
    Ordinance 2016-55 revises the official zoning map of the City of St. Cloud to indicate a new historic preservation overlay district for real property, known as the historic downtown district, and located: south of 9th Street, east of Wisconsin Avenue, north of 13th Street, and west of Ohio Avenue. 

FIGURE 1 - Historic Downtown District
(Ord. No. 2016-55 , § 1, 12-8-2016) 
DIVISION 26. - NON-RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS 

3.26.1. - Non-Residential Architectural Design Standards. 
A.  Intent. The intent of these architectural standards is to ensure that future non-residential developments will have a high level of overall aesthetic appeal and visual interest, thereby promoting the City of St. Cloud as an attractive destination for residents, workers and visitors and supporting its economic vitality while also protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
The architectural elements used in the design of new buildings shall create and/or maintain continuity of the street wall and façade. New building façades shall employ architectural elements that provide gradual or compatible transitions between existing and new buildings. Such elements include continuity of scale, rhythm, proportion, massing and design, windows and transparency, façade treatment, building material, color, access, and open space which collectively serve as logical evolutions of the existing character of the street. This does not mean that identical architectural styles shall be duplicated from neighborhood buildings. Rather, continuity shall be maintained through a consistency in proportion and character of defining elements of existing façades or repetition of other architectural features. 
B.  Applicability. The non-residential architectural standards set forth in this section shall apply to all proposed non-residential development within the city, and shall apply when application is made for planned unit development preliminary master plan that includes non-residential development, applications for site development plans that include non-residential development or building permit approval. These standards shall also apply to existing development if a building's gross floor area is increased by 50 percent or more. 
Exemption. The non-residential architectural standards set forth in this section do not apply when the city council has established specific architectural standards for a unique overlay district, like the downtown historic district, unless the specific architectural standards otherwise expressly state their applicability. In addition, the city council may require, in a planned unit development, architectural standards that exceed the requirements of this section for an individual project when council determines that such enhanced architectural standards would be in the best interested of the public health, safety and welfare. 
If any of the non-residential architectural standards set forth in this Section conflict with any other provision of the City of St. Cloud Code of Ordinances or Land Development Code, the provision that establishes the more specified architectural standard shall govern. If neither conflicting provision establishes a specific architectural standard, then the more restrictive provision governs unless otherwise expressly provided. 
Deviation. Deviations from the provisions outlined in this section may be appealed by the board of zoning adjustment or city council provided that the deviation will not be contrary to the public interest and will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this section and where either of the following applies: 
a.  Conditions exist that are not the result of the applicant and which are such that a literal enforcement of the regulations involved would result in unnecessary or undue hardship; or 
b.  Literal conformity with the regulations would inhibit innovation or creativity in design. 
C.  Consistency within an existing development. Buildings within a development shall be designed with color schemes, building materials, roof types, roof lines, and exterior roof finish consistent with or that resemble those of the principal building or structure on the site. 
D.  Consistency and integrity of building components. All portions of any exterior side of a building, extending from finished grade to the top of the parapet wall or eaves, extending the entire width of the side of a building, must be designed with consistent architectural style, detail and trim features. 
E.  Buildings facing public streets. On a site that abuts an arterial or collector street, any portion of a building wall which is located not more than 250 feet from and that faces a collector street or an arterial street, shall have at least 25 percent glazing. 
F.  Required design elements based on gross floor area. All exterior sides of a building subject to this section shall provide design elements in accordance with the gross square footage of a building, as provided herein. Design elements required by this section may be located, at the discretion of the developer, on an exterior wall of a building required to comply with this section, on the roof of the building, or on both wall(s) and the roof of a building, as applicable. Buildings with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or less shall require design elements from a minimum of three of the following 17 categories. Buildings with a gross floor area of more than 10,000 square feet but less than 50,000 square feet shall require design elements from a minimum of four of the following 17 categories. Buildings with a gross floor area of 50,000 square feet or greater shall require design elements from a minimum of five of the following 17 categories. 
Gross floor area. 
Less than 10,000 square feet: Requires three of the design elements below. 
10,000-50,000 square feet: Requires four of the design elements below. 
Greater than 50,000: Requires five of the design elements below.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-07 , § IV, adopted March 24, 2016, amended Art. V in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former Art. V, Divs. 1-7, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 87-EEE, adopted Sept. 10, 1987; Ord. No. 87-FFF, adopted Oct. 8, 1987; Ord. No. 99-19, adopted April 22, 1999; Ord. No. 2000-51, adopted Dec. 14, 2000; and Ord. No. 2007-96, § 3(5.3.2, 5.3.2.14, 5.3.3.2, 5.3.3.3), adopted Oct. 11, 2007. 
State Law reference- Platting, F.S. § 117.011 et seq. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

5.1.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    The public health, safety, comfort, and welfare require the harmonious, orderly, and progressive development of land within the corporate limits of the city. Once the subdivision of land has been shaped into building lots, blocks, and streets, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Substantial public responsibility is created by each new subdivision, involving the maintenance of streets and drainage facilities, and the provision of additional public services. As the general welfare, health, safety, and convenience of the community are thereby directly affected by the use of land as a subdivision, it is in the direct interest of the public that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. Consideration shall be given to the character of an area and the availability of public facilities to ensure the compatibility and coordination of land uses and facilities within a given geographic unit. The purpose and intent, therefore, of this article is to serve as one of the several instruments of land use control authorized by the state legislature for the city and to secure: 
A.  The establishment of standards of subdivision design which will encourage the development of sound and stable areas within the corporate limits of the city; 
B.  Installation to prescribed standards by the land developer of those required improvements which ought not become a charge on the citizens and taxpayers of already existing areas; 
C.  The adequate and efficient supply of utilities, streets, and services to new land developments; 
D.  The prevention of haphazard, premature, or scattered land development; 
E.  The prevention of traffic hazards and congestion which result from narrow or poorly aligned streets and from excessive ingress and egress points along major traffic arteries, and the provision of safe and convenient traffic circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in new land development; 
F.  Safety from fire, panic, and other dangers to promote health and the general welfare; 
G.  Protection from flooding hazards and ensure proper water management; 
H.  The provision of public open spaces in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, and other public purposes; 
I.  Coordination of land development in accordance with orderly physical patterns and general plans and policies adopted by the city council, in particular, the city comprehensive land use plan; 
J.  Protection of the natural and scenic resources of the city, including surface waters and groundwater recharge areas. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07 , § IV, 3-24-2016) 
5.1.2. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this article are applicable to the division of a parcel of land (which in this context is defined to mean the totality of contiguous land holdings by a single owner regardless of how described or recorded) into two or more parcels for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership or building development, and also includes all cases where: 
A.  The subdivider advocates, proposes, suggests or exhibits a proposed plan, map, or plat of development of land; or 
B.  The subdivider proposes to create a street, right-of-way, or easement that joins or connects to an existing public street. 
    Property subdivided prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall comply with all requirements of this article unless such property fully complied with the terms of all requirements in effect at the time such property was divided. Where a flnal plat has not been recorded, the following shall apply: 
A.  Those proposed subdivisions which have obtained preliminary approvals, but have not recorded a plat and/or completed the installation of all required improvements prior to the effective date of these regulations, shall be subject to reevaluation by the development review committee and the city council based upon all new regulations and requirements contained in the land development code, unless final plat approval is obtained within 12 months from the effective date of these regulations. In the event that this deadline is not met, and the city council determines that the failure to meet this requirement was due to administrative reviews or delays not attributable to the developer, a reasonable extension of time may be granted by the city council. 
B.  Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit or modify the rights of any person to complete any development for which a plat has been recorded, or for which a building permit or other authorization to commence development has been obtained prior to the effective date of these regulations, provided that there has been a good faith change in position and/or substantial expenditures made in reliance upon such approval as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
C.  For these subdivisions which are determined by the city council to have vested rights, so as to be entitled to complete the subdivision improvements in accordance with previously submitted plans, failure to diligently prosecute the required work to a timely completion shall result in a forfeiture of the previously vested rights, and such subdivision shall then be subject to re-evaluation by the city. 
D.  Owners of all or part of undeveloped or partially developed plats shall have one year from the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived to apply to the city for a determination of vested rights. Failure to so apply shall result in all such plats being vacated for purposes of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07 , § IV, 3-24-2016) 
DIVISION 2. - PROCEDURES FOR SECURING APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY SUBDIVISION PLANS, SUBDIVISION CONSTRUCTION PLANS, AND FINAL PLAT 

5.2.1. - Intent. 
    It shall be the intent of the city that there be an orderly process for the approval of the subdivision plats in the city. This process is intended to permit full and adequate review by the city in order to ensure and protect the public interest. This process will also benefit the subdivider by providing for the identification of potential problems with the development and offering solutions to alleviating those problems. This three-step process shall be: 
(1)  The preliminary subdivision plan; 
(2)  The subdivision construction plan; and 
(3)  The final plat. 
    The plans may be reviewed concurrently at the applicant's risk. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07 , § IV, 3-24-2016) 
5.2.2. - Review of preliminary subdivision plan. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary subdivision plan is to provide for the initial review of the proposed development site. Complete and accurate presentation of the data shall be provided. This will allow complete review and evaluation of the proposed development and its impact on both the site and the surrounding areas. 
B.  Initiation point and deadline. All submittals must be made to the department of planning and zoning. 
C.  Submittals. The preliminary subdivision plan shall consist of a lot design geometry plan and other auxiliary submittals as required by the city manager or their designee.

DIVISION 5. - VACATING OF PLATS, REPLATS AND CORRECTION OF ERRORS 

5.5.1. - Vacation of plats. 
A.  By owner. The owner of any land subdivided into lots may petition the city under the provisions of F.S. § 177.101 to remove (vacate and annul) the existing plat, or portion of a plat, from the official records of the county. The applicant for vacating of a plat, or a part of a plat, shall file the petition, proof of publication of notice of intent, certificate of title, statement of taxes and resolution, and shall pay the appropriate filing fee as established by the city. Following review of the appropriate departments the petition shall be acted upon by the city council. The applicant shall be responsible for recording the petition and the proof of publication with the clerk of the circuit court for the county. 
B.  By city. The city council may, on its own motion, order the vacation and annulment of all or any part of a plat within its jurisdiction after conducting a public hearing, provided that: 
1.  The subdivision plat was lawfully recorded not less than five years before such action by council; and 
2.  No more than ten percent of the total subdivision or phase thereof, has been sold as lots by the original subdivider or his successor in title. 
3.  Such action shall be based on a finding by the council that: 
a.  The proposed vacation and annulment of the plat will result in greater conformity with the comprehensive plan of the area; and 
b.  The public health, safety, and welfare will be promoted thereby. 
4.  Notwithstanding these provisions, the city may require conformity with existing standards for all or parts of subdivisions as outlined in section 5.1.2. For rights-of-way and easement abandonment procedures, see section 5.5.4. 
C.  Access to individually owned parcels. No owner of any parcel of land in a subdivision shall be deprived by the vacation and annulment of a plat, or a portion of a plat, of reasonable access to such parcel nor of reasonable access therefrom to existing facilities to which such parcel has access; provided, however, that such access remaining or provided after such vacation need not be the same as that theretofore existing. 
(Ord. No. 2016-07 , § IV, 3-24-2016) 
5.5.2. - Replats and resubdivision.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

8.1.1. - Purpose and applicability. 
    8.1.1.1. Purpose. The City of St. Cloud is proud to be a Tree City USA community and as such the city council finds it is in the best public interest and welfare to support the preservation and expansion of quality trees and landscape within the city wherever possible and in a manner consistent with the economic enjoyment of private property. 
    Trees play a pronounced and important part in communitywide air quality, wildlife habitat, soil conservation, erosion control and flood control; and 
    Trees are an invaluable psychological counterpoint to the manmade urban and suburban setting, camouflaging harsh scenery and unsightly city-scape and softening the outline of masonry, metal and glass; and 
    Trees increase the value of property and are valuable property that can affect an area economically, beautifying the land and breaking the monotony of endless sidewalks and miles of highways and streets. 
    Landscape planting and irrigation plans shall be designed utilizing Florida Friendly Landscaping TM principles to achieve the following objectives: 
    Conserve supplemental water use through Florida Friendly Landscaping TM principles and Florida Water Star SM criteria for water efficiency. 
    Preserve significant natural systems and promote the continuity of open space and greenway systems (e.g. wildlife corridors or wetland systems). 
    Reduce storm water pollution through the reduction of impervious surfaces and rate of flow from landscaped developed areas 
    Reduce presence of invasive and exotic plant material. 
    Minimize the negative impacts of utility service/tree conflicts. 
    Reduce negative impacts of noise, heat, glare, water runoff and other conditions associated with the construction of expanses of building or pavement within the city. 
    Address visual privacy and the maintenance of important viewsheds relative to adjacent developed properties. 
    Utilize qualified professionals with knowledge of the natural systems of the region such as a landscape architect or horticulturalist in the preparation of landscape and irrigation plans. 
    8.1.1.2. Applicability. The terms and provisions of this article shall apply to all real property, public and private, without exception, lying within the municipal boundaries of the city. 
    The standards established in this article are to be considered the minimum requirements for the design, plant selection, installation and maintenance of landscape elements and shall apply to all new development, within the municipal boundaries of the city. 
    Single family detached homes are exempt for the requirements of divisions 4 and 5 of this article. Bona-fide agricultural uses are exempt from the requirements of this article. 
    Prior to the installation of any landscaping within public rights-of-ways, if not part of a previously approved SDP, a right-of-way utilization permit shall be obtained in accordance with the guidelines herein. 
    In the event that a principal use and some or all of the parking area (required or otherwise) serving the principal use are located on separate parcels, as permitted by this LDC, the open space and landscape required by this article may be apportioned among all parcels in a cohesive fashion as approved on the SDP.

As an alternative to a tree survey or inventory, the developer may assume the maximum existing tree mitigation requirement. Plans shall promote the health and viability of the trees, with an emphasis on preserving larger tree canopy as well as community aesthetics. 
    Should any of the required preservation trees be approved for removal, resulting in an existing preserved upland tree canopy of less than the required 60 inches D.B.H., a replacement tree shall be installed with a mitigation factor of one tree for every three inches D.B.H. removed up to the minimum mitigation requirement stated above. 
( Ord. No. 2017-37, § 2, 10-26-2017 ) 
8.3.2. - Barriers required. 
    During the development of property, any person owning a legal interest in the real property under construction, the contractor who has been issued tree removal permit and the contractor who has been issued a building permit shall be equally responsible for the erection of any and all protective barriers, to protect any existing or installed trees from damage during construction in accordance with the tree protective barrier requirements and specifications detailed in the illustration and text labeled "Tree Protection Barrier." The property owners and contractors described above shall be subject to a $250.00 initial penalty and $100.00 daily penalty if the tree protection barriers are not in place around all protected trees prior to and during any land clearing activity, demolition activity, construction staging activity, or construction activity. Additionally, the work may be stopped by the building official, city arborist, city engineer or their designee until appropriate tree protection barriers [are] in place. Trees destroyed or receiving major damage must be replaced before occupancy or use unless approval for their removal has been granted under permit. 
( Ord. No. 2017-37, § 2, 10-26-2017 ) 
8.3.3. - Barrier zones. 
    All trees and vegetation not designated for removal may be required by the terms of the permit to be protected by barrier zones erected prior to construction of any structures, roads, utility service or other improvements, and may be required, by the terms of the permit, to comply with the following if determined to be necessary by the city manager or his/her designee: 
    Tree and vegetation protection, in compliance with the city approved protection barrier detail (Figure 8.3.1.), shall be installed and remain in place and intact until such time as landscape operations begin or construction is complete, whichever occurs first. 
    Storage or placement of soil deposits, debris, solvents, construction material, machinery or other equipment of any kind shall be prohibited within the drip-line of a protected tree. 
    In no case shall heavy equipment be permitted access within the protected zone. 
    No grade changes shall be made within the protective barrier zones, without prior approval of the city manager or his/her designee. 
    Any required removal of vegetation surrounding the tree shall be done using hand tools. 
    Where roots greater than one inch diameter are exposed, they shall be cut cleanly and protected from drying out prior to soil backfill. 
    Where it is not practical for underground utility lines to be routed around the tree dripline, boring/tunneling shall be employed to route the lines though the area to prevent significant root damage to protected tree. 
Figure 8.3.1. TREE PROTECTION BARRIER

( Ord. No. 2017-37, § 2, 10-26-2017 ) 
8.3.4. - Attachments prohibited. 
    No attachments and wires other than those of a protective and non-damaging nature shall be attached to any tree. 
( Ord. No. 2017-37, § 2, 10-26-2017 ) 
8.3.5. - Periodic inspection. 
    The city manager or his or her designee may conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during cleaning, construction and post-construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this article. 
( Ord. No. 2017-37, § 2, 10-26-2017 ) 
8.3.6. - Penalties for violations. 
    Should any tree be removed without a permit, or severely pruned such as to no longer provide a natural tree form the following shall apply: 
No building permits shall be issued on lands where violations of this article are determined to exist, until such time as appropriate remedial action is agreed to by the city and completed by the owner of the land. 
No certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for any construction until all applicable remedies have been accomplished. Failure to obtain a permit prior to commencement of work shall result in the doubling of the fee. 
    Appropriate remedial action shall include, but is not limited to, the doubling of the landscaping tree requirement, the replacement of tree(s) with similar physical size and/or replacement at an inch for inch (D.B.H.) ratio. 
( Ord. No. 2017-37, § 2, 10-26-2017 ) 
DIVISION 4. - LANDSCAPE BUFFERS AND OPEN SPACE 

8.4. - Landscape buffers. 
8.4.1. - [Mixed-use district.] 
    Within a mixed-use district, landscape buffers shall not be allowed between place types, between adjacent neighborhoods or between buildings and roadways. Landscape buffers may be provided along the boundary line of a mixed-use district to mitigate any potential conflicts with adjacent development. 
( Ord. No. 2017-37, § 2, 10-26-2017 ) 
8.4.2. - [Landscape buffers within the city.] 
    Landscaped buffers within the city shall be developed between differing land uses based on the following. These requirements shall be deemed the minimum necessary to achieve compatibility between land uses. Buffer yards shall be developed by the more intense use based on existing adjacent contiguous uses, zoning or the site development plan whichever is most intense. In addition to the buffer criteria outlined herein, new development shall also adhere to other landscape requirements within the LDC. The buffer yard criteria described herein does not alleviate any other buffer requirement due to state mandate. Project buffers shall be generally located along the outer perimeter of the parcel to be developed extending inward from the parcel boundaries. Proposed uses are listed in the order of intensity. 
1.  No structures are permitted in buffers except bus shelters, decorative hardscape features or decorative walls/fences. Parking is also prohibited within a buffer area. 
2.  Buffer yard requirements: Minimum buffer types required on property boundaries between differing uses shall be as shown in Tables 8.4.1 and 8.4.2 below. 
3.  Existing non-invasive vegetation may be used to fulfill buffering and screening requirements outlined herein, where such existing natural vegetation is of sufficient height and density or can be augmented to reach the requirements for height and opacity. 
4.  Where two differing land uses are located opposite each other across a right-of-way, the buffer yard design type shall be further reduced to one full degree below the required standard. 
5.  Buffer areas on residential developments shall be designated as common areas and shall not be included within lots. Buffers on non-residential sites may be included within lots and counted toward setback and open space requirements. The city manager or his or her designee may reduce or eliminate the required buffer where it can be shown by the applicant that the reduction is warranted by unique site features or characteristics or by the addition of structural elements (e.g. masonry walls). Conservation areas, water bodies and open spaces are exempt from this requirement. If a permanent buffer exists on the adjacent property which meets the requirements herein, no additional buffer will be required.

    Open space shall be provided according to the criteria listed in this article as defined below. 
    Within the city, a minimum of 15 percent of the developable area for a non-residential development, including the non-residential portion of a multiple-use planned development, shall be designated and function as open space. Likewise, a minimum of 20 percent of the developable area for a residential development, including the residential portion of a multiple-use planned development, shall be designated and function as open space. Further, a minimum of 20 percent of the developable area of a mixed use development shall be designated and function as open space. If preserved wetlands are included in the open space requirement then the requirements shall be calculated on the gross project area. 
    Open space within the city, as described by article 3.22.2.H. open space, shall be credited towards the open space requirements for development. If preserved wetlands are included in the open space requirement then the requirement shall be calculated on the gross project area. 
    Open space elements shall be available to all residents and users of the development. 
    Areas such as private lot setback yards, right of way, and isolated areas not available to the residents and users of the development are not considered open space to meet the requirements stated above. Only parking lots required for civic or recreational uses may be counted towards the open space requirements. General uses of acceptable open space elements to meet the requirement as defined below include preservation of environmentally sensitive areas, passive recreation and active recreation. 
    Preserved wetlands and water management areas, if designed appropriately with pedestrian access available, may contribute to the open space acreage, but because of their limited open space value, can in no case comprise more than 50 percent of the required open space acreage. 
    Buffers, greenways, wildlife corridors and recreation areas shall be counted towards the required open space acreage. 
    Developments which include preservation of significant native vegetation, habitat areas for rare and endangered plant and/or animal species may reduce the open space requirement at a 1:1 ratio up to one-third of the total required open space for the development when such preservation is determined by the city to be ecologically viable.

    Any person, firm or corporation, or agent of any person, firm or corporation who neglects, fails or refuses to comply with or violates any of the provisions of this article, or the Florida Building Code, or fails to comply therewith or with any of the requirements thereof, or is found to be in violation of a detailed statement or plan submitted and approved shall be fined in a sum not to exceed $250.00 per day, at the discretion of the code enforcement board. Each time such person, firm or corporation neglects, fails, or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this article, it shall be deemed a separate offense and punished as herein provided. The owner of a building, structure, or premises, where anything in violation of the Florida Building Code shall be placed or shall exist, and an architect, builder, contractor agent, person or corporation employed in connection therewith and who may have assisted in the commission of such violation shall be guilty of a separate offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as herein provided. 
    The imposition of penalties herein prescribed shall not preclude the city attorney from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding to prevent an unlawful construction, alteration, erection, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, or to restrain, correct or abate a violation, or prevent the occupancy of a building, structure or premises, or to prevent an illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about any premises. 
    As an alternative, or as an additional means of collecting such costs as the city may incur in enforcement of these regulations, or making any reparations, the city shall have a lien on such lot or parcel of land for such cost, which lien shall be of equal dignity with the lien of state, county and municipal taxes. Such lien may be foreclosed by the city in the same manner provided by the laws of the state for the foreclosure of mortgages upon real estate. Costs shall mean all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, court costs, court reporter expenses, and any other expense of litigation. 
13.5. - Certifications and licensing. 
    Every person engaged or intending to engage in business in this city as a contractor, general contractor, residential contractor, or other trade regulated and as defined in F.S. ch. 489 shall present to the building official a certificate of competency from said board, except for those registered heretofore under the grandfather clause, or take such examination as to their competency to engage in the business of construction or home improvements as may be approved by the city, provided that examinations and certificates by Block and Associates, Department of Building Construction, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, with a grade of 75 percent or more, or proctored by Block and Associates or any other department or official of a county or municipality, including a certificate or letter of confirmation from such department or official showing the applicant successfully qualified as competent.

13.7. - Florida Building Code adopted. 
    All matters and requirements within the scope of this article which are not specifically covered herein shall conform to the provisions of the Florida Building Code. 
13.8. - Floor elevations. 
    The minimum first floor elevation shall not be less than 16 inches above the high crown of the fronting paved road, and the floor level of any garage or carport shall not be less than eight inches above said high crown. Where the property involved adjoins more than one street, then the building official shall determine which street crown shall be used to establish floor levels. In the event that the property upon which the building is constructed does not adjoin a paved street, then the finished elevation of the high crown of the adjoining street called for by the city paving plan, as determined by the city engineer, shall be used to establish the minimum floor levels set forth herein. This provision does not apply to outbuildings. 
    This provision is not intended to prevent any alternate method, reducing the required elevation, when designed by an engineer. The engineer, legally registered under the laws of the state, shall affix his official seal to the submittals for approval. 
13.9. - Roof covering. 
    No new metal roofing shall hereafter be installed on buildings in residential areas where other types of roofing prevail more than metal roofs on surrounding homes. Metal roof replacement or repairs shall be permitted on existing buildings. Metal roofs shall be permitted on accessory structures and as approved in historical districts. 
13.10. - Drainage surveys. 
    The building official may, in his discretion, require a survey of any building lot or site showing all drainage from such lot or site prior to issuing a building permit or certificate of occupancy, or both. Prior to issuing a certificate of occupancy, the building official shall ascertain that the building lot or site has been graded so that all surface waters from such lot or site will drain into the city storm drain system without crossing or traversing any other lot or private property, and that such lot or site has been leveled sufficiently to prevent stagnation of water in low spots or ditches and to facilitate mowing of the property. 
13.11. - Conduit required.

    The point of service entrance to buildings and the location of the electric meter shall in each case be determined by the city manager or his designee. 
13.12. - Installation of sewer and water lines across adjacent lots. 
    Unless a right-of-way or easement is recorded in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county, it shall not be permissible to install any sewer, drain, or water service lines to or from any building or premises across any adjacent property or premises even though at the time of the proposed installation the adjacent properties are under common ownership. 
13.13. - Prohibited drainage. 
    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, sub-surface drainage, cooling water, swimming pool water (except backwash regulated by the state department of health) to any public sanitary sewer. 
Article XIV - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
State Law reference- Concurrency, F.S. § 163.3180. 

14.1. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of this article to ensure that public facilities and services needed to support development shall be available concurrent with the impacts of such development. 
    This article sets forth criteria for assessment of development impact and guidelines to ensure that the adopted level of service standards (found in the city's comprehensive plan) required for roads, potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, and parks and recreation. 
    The city shall determine, prior to the issuance of development orders, whether or not there is sufficient capacity of public facilities to meet the standards for levels of service for existing development and the proposed development, concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. 
    In no case shall the city issue a development order to a proposed development until there is sufficient capacity of public facilities to meet the adopted level of service standards for existing development and the proposed development. Such sufficiency shall be based on the guidelines, standards, and procedures set forth in this article. 
14.2. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article, the following terms and words shall have the meaning prescribed unless the content of the text clearly requires otherwise: 
    Affected roadway. A roadway within the city's roadway network which is impacted by greater than five percent of a development's attracted or generated vehicle trips during the P.M. peak hour. 
    Category "A" public facility. Arterial and collector roads, drainage, potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, and parks and recreation facilities owned or operated by the city. 
    Category "B" public facility. Arterial and collector roads, drainage, potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, and parks and recreation facilities owned or operated by federal, state, and county governments, independent districts, and private organizations. 
    Certificate of capacity. A legal document which records the reservation of capacity of public facilities for a development. The certificate shall contain a legal description of the property on which development will occur, the name of the applicant and property owner, the type of development, the criteria used in assessing capacity needs, the amounts of capacity reserved for both Category "A" and Category "B" public facilities, and the length of time and conditions for which such capacity is reserved. The certificate shall be recorded with the city clerk (i.e., city manager) and filed in the office of the city manager and general services department. At the option of the applicant and property owner, the certificate shall be filed in the public records of the county and shall run with the land. 
    City grid. That area bounded by Eastern Avenue to the East, Columbia/Budinger Avenue to the West, Lakeshore Boulevard to the North, and 17th Street to the South. 
    Concurrency test. A determination that there is sufficient capacity of public facilities to meet the standards for levels of service for existing development and the proposed development, concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. 
    Development order. Any order granting, denying, or granting with conditions an application for a building permit, zoning permit, subdivision approval, rezoning, certification, special exception, variance, or any other official action of the city having the effect of permitting the development of land. (See also Preliminary development order, and Final development order. ) 
    Encumbrance. A temporary reservation of facility capacity. During the process of review of a development order, and based on the results of a concurrency test, facility capacity shall be "encumbered" until final disposition and action on the underlying development order. 
    Enforceable development agreement. Any agreement which assures facilities and services are in place with the impacts of development. Enforceable development agreements may include, but are not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. 
    Final development order. A building permit, site plan approval, final subdivision plat approval for residential single lot or duplex lot subdivisions, or any other development order which results in an immediate and continuing impact upon public facilities. 
    Preliminary development order. A preliminary subdivision plat approval for single lot or duplex lot subdivisions, preliminary or final subdivision plat approval for commercial and/or industrial subdivisions, rezonings, and any other development order other than a final development order. 
    Substantial development activity. Construction activity which has occurred on a site which meets or exceeds 50 percent of the required construction expenditure for fulfillment of the development order, or when at least 25 percent of the required construction expenditure for fulfillment of said development order occurs in any calendar year. 
14.3. - Development orders requiring concurrency test. 
    All final development orders issued on or after June 30, 1991, are required to be assessed for concurrency. Prior to the issuance of a final development order, the developer/applicant must obtain a certificate of capacity. 
    For purposes of this section, final development orders are considered to be: 
 Final subdivision plat approval for single-family or duplex subdivisions and residential planned unit developments, including residentially zoned areas of the city grid; and 
 Site plan approval or building permit for commercial, industrial, or multifamily projects. 
    There are four possible scenarios related to vested rights and concurrency (i.e., capacity availability) as described by the following table: 
Vested for Development Rights Yes 
Development order prior to 6-30-1991 No 
Development order after 6-30-1991 Capacity Available Yes (1) 
Issue development order and reserve capacity (2) 
Issue development order and reserve capacity No (3) 
Issue development order and lien on future capacity (4) 
Do not issue development order and no reservation of capacity  
Notes relating to above table: 
(1) Property is vested for development and capacity is available: Capacity will be reserved because it is available. 
(2) Property is not vested for development but capacity is available: Capacity will be reserved because it is available. 
(3) Property is vested for development but capacity is not available, or is not sufficient: Available capacity is reserved with a "lien" on future capacity until capacity catches up with demand. Any and all previously issued development orders have priority over any new development orders for future capacity. 
(4) Property is not vested for development and capacity is not available: Capacity is not reserved. 
    14.3.1. Development orders issued prior to June 30, 1991, and vested for development rights. Final development orders issued prior to June 30, 1991, are determined to be vested for concurrency for the following time periods: 
(a)  Final subdivision approval for single-family or duplex subdivisions and residential planned unit developments (PUD), including residentially zoned areas of the city grid, are entirely vested and individual building lots in these subdivisions and the city grid do not need to undergo a concurrency test at the time of application for a building permit, unless: 
(1)  There is a change in the zoning classification or land use for the land; 
(2)  There is a major alteration to the subdivision resulting in an increase in the number of buildable lots; 
(3)  Improvements which have been bonded to serve the approved subdivision or PUD have not been installed and the performance bond for said improvements expires; or 
(4)  In cases where no performance bond has been posted and improvements are not completed, substantial construction activity has not occurred within one year of the date of issuance of the final subdivision approval. 
(b)  Site plan approval for commercial, industrial, or multifamily projects are vested for one year from June 30, 1991, for traffic circulation, potable water, solid waste, drainage, and recreation/open space; and for 180 days from June 30, 1991, or one year from the receipt of payment of full sewer impact fee for the project. 
(c)  Land zoned for multifamily residential uses and where all services have been constructed and approved, or when said improvements have been bonded, as of June 30, 1991, are vested for one year from June 30, 1991, for traffic circulation, potable water, solid waste, drainage, and recreation/open space; and for 180 days from June 30, 1991, or one year from the receipt of payment of full sewer impact fee based on the maximum buildout of the land parcel. 
(d)  Additional time may be granted by the city council, following application of extension and appeal to the time periods noted in subsections (a), (b) and (c) above. The city council shall extend and set additional time periods for vested rights at formal public hearing and after formal recommendation of the city planning commission. Any additional time allowance for vested rights shall be based on the following criteria: 
(1)  Good faith reliance on an act or omission of the city; 
(2)  Substantial expenditures or obligations subsequent to reliance on an act or omission of the city; and 
(3)  Highly inequitable to deny development (i.e., private hardship outweighs the public hardship). 
In addition, final development orders issued prior to June 30, 1991, shall be vested for the time periods noted above provided that: 
(a)  The original development order, or a formal extension of said development order, has not expired; or 
(b)  Development activity, excluding single-family or duplex development, has occurred on site prior to expiration of the original development order and substantial construction activity has occurred within one year of the issuance of the final development order; and 
(c)  A certificate of occupancy is issued and/or site improvements have been accepted by the city engineer. 
Once a certificate of occupancy is issued for commercial, industrial, or multifamily development, those completed structures shall be entirely vested. 
    14.3.2. Exemptions from concurrency test. Certain development causes no added impacts on facilities, and therefore can be considered exempt from concurrency and the requirement to undergo a concurrency test. 
    The following development orders or permits are considered exempt from concurrency: 
(a)  Room additions (including screen rooms) to a residence; 
(b)  Accessory structure to a residence; 
(c)  Amenities: swimming pools, fences, walls, and signs; 
(d)  Replacement structures which have no difference in impact on public facilities; 
(e)  Utility stations and substations (e.g., microwave stations, electric utility transformer stations, lift stations); 
(f)  Use permits or right-of-way permits; 
(g)  Completion or finishing permits if the shell permit was vested or tested for concurrency (e.g., obtained certificate of capacity); or 
(h)  Any other development that generates no impact on public facilities. 
    14.3.3. Concurrency test requirements. For development that requires one or more public facilities which are provided by entities other than the city, the city shall condition the issuance of any final development order for the same parcel on the availability of such public facilities (see section 14.8.7). 
(Ord. No. 2009-11, § 2(14.3.3), 5-14-2009) 
14.4. - Application for concurrency tests. 
    The actual concurrency test is a determination of the capacity of public facilities needed by each applicant, and a comparison of the needed amount of capacity to the capacity that is actually available. If the capacity available is equal to or greater than the capacity needed, the concurrency test is passed, and a certificate of capacity is issued and recorded. If the capacity available is less than the capacity needed, the concurrency test is failed. 
    The applicant may choose to undergo a concurrency test, at either the time of, or prior to, application of a preliminary development order, or at the time of application for a final development order. For purposes of determining whether a development order is preliminary or final, the following table is to be used. 
Development Order Type Preliminary Final Type 
of 
Development Single-Family and 

Duplex Subdivisions Preliminary 

Subdivision 

Plan Approval Final Subdivision 

Plat Approval Multifamily 

and Nonresidential Final Plat Approval; Rezoning; or Site Plan Approval Site Plan Approval; or Building Permit  
Notes relating to above table: 
(1) Applicant for multifamily and nonresidential developments may choose the site plan approval process as either a preliminary or a final development order. 
(2) Applicants for planned unit developments (PUD) use rezoning and preliminary development plans for the preliminary development order. Depending on the type of PUD, the final development order shall be a final plat (residential PUD) or site plan/building permit (commercial or industrial PUD). 
    An applicant for a preliminary development order may select either of two options related to the concurrency test: 
 Voluntarily request a concurrency test at the time of, or prior to, preliminary development order application, and pay all associated fees to reserve capacity; or 
 Defer the concurrency test until a final development order review, and sign an affidavit acknowledging that future rights to develop the property are subject to the future concurrency test, and without such a test, no vested rights have been granted by the city or acquired by the applicant. 
    All applications for a concurrency test shall include the following: 
(a)  Name of project; 
(b)  Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant and the agent and the firm which they represent; 
(c)  Statement of intended use of the site; 
(d)  Existing land use classification and zoning of the site; 
(e)  Legal description of the property and size of the parcel in acres or square feet; 
(f)  Number of dwelling units and/or building lots and the density of the project for multifamily site plans; 
(g)  If applicable, a phasing plan specifying the number of units per phase and estimated dates of commencement of construction and buildout of phases; 
(h)  Square footage for proposed development (i.e., gross square footage, non-storage area, square footage of each story, gross square footage of sales area, etc.); and 
(i)  Any other information required by the general services department in order to adequately determine the impacts of the proposed development on public facilities. 
    All applications are on a first come, first serve basis, and if capacity is available, that capacity shall be encumbered (for time periods set forth herein) until a final development order and a certificate of capacity is issued. Some public facilities may require that encumbered capacity be ensured through payment of fees as set forth and authorized in section 14.7 of these regulations. 
    All concurrency test applications are required to pay a fee to process the concurrency test and provide a concurrency determination. The schedule of fees are set forth and authorized in section 14.7 of these regulations. 
    14.4.1. Predevelopment order application concurrency test review. Prior to submittal of an application for a preliminary development order, the applicant may apply for a concurrency test and capacity determination. All applicable fees for a concurrency test must be paid. 
Within five days of the receipt of the application, the city shall notify the applicant of the need for additional information and/or fees to process the concurrency test. 
The city shall schedule the concurrency test for review by and action of the city's development review committee (DRC) no earlier than 14 days from the date of receipt of the complete application, nor later than 30 days from the date of receipt of the complete application. 
The development review committee may continue action of the application until the next development review committee meeting, but no longer than 14 days, for any of the following reasons: 
(a)  Reasonable doubt to the accuracy of the determination, and/or a need for a recalculation of the impacts on the facility capacity; 
(b)  Inadequate information to make a determination; or 
(c)  A member charged with authority over the public facility has not provided information regarding the impacts on the facility capacity. 
The city's development review committee shall review and act on the request for capacity by recommending the concurrency test be: 
(a)  Passed and a certificate of capacity be issued; 
(b)  Failed and a certificate of capacity not be issued; or 
(c)  Passed for public facilities which have capacity, and failed for public facilities which do not have capacity with recommendations for: 
(1)  The applicant to amend his application to "balance" it with available capacity; 
(2)  The applicant to withdraw the application and resubmit at a later date; or 
(3)  The applicant to develop alternatives for providing the facilities to eliminate the insufficiency. 
Any and all public facilities which pass the concurrency test shall be encumbered, and said encumbrance shall remain provided the application continues for final development in the time periods specified in these regulations. 
Facility capacities encumbered, and passed, by a predevelopment order application concurrency test review, shall expire within 60 days of the action of the development review committee unless a preliminary development order application is made. If the preliminary development order application is not made, any encumbered capacity shall be returned to the capacity pool and made available to other applicants. 
    14.4.2. Preliminary development order application concurrency test review. If the concurrency test has not been made through procedures identified in section 14.4.1, above, the applicant for a preliminary development order may: 
(a)  Voluntarily request a concurrency test at the time of, or prior to, preliminary development order application, and pay all associated fees to reserve capacity; or 
(b)  Defer the concurrency test until a final development order review, and sign an affidavit acknowledging that future rights to develop the property are subject to the future concurrency test, and without such a test, no vested rights have been granted by the city or acquired by the applicant. 
If the applicant chooses to apply for a concurrency test at the time of application for a preliminary development order, all fees established for processing the concurrency test shall be paid prior to processing the preliminary development order. 
The concurrency test shall be processed concurrently with the application for a preliminary development order. The city's development review committee shall review and act on the request for capacity by recommending the concurrency test be: 
(a)  Passed and a certificate of capacity be issued; 
(b)  Failed and a certificate of capacity not be issued; or 
(c)  Passed for public facilities which have capacity, and failed for public facilities which do not have capacity with recommendations for: 
(1)  The applicant to amend his application to "balance" it with available capacity; 
(2)  The applicant to withdraw the application and resubmit at a later date; or 
(3)  The applicant to develop alternatives for providing the facilities to eliminate the insufficiency. 
The city manager, or designee, shall, at the time of approval of the preliminary development order, issue a certificate of capacity and public facility capacity shall be reserved for the development in the amounts stated in the certificate. If the preliminary development order is not issued, the applicant may appeal the decision and the public facility capacity shall remain encumbered until the results of the appeal are finalized. 
Any and all public facilities which are included in the certificate of capacity shall be reserved, and said reservation shall remain in effect provided the application continues for final development in the time periods specified in these regulations, and all fees for reservation of capacity are paid as authorized in section 14.7 of these regulations. 
The certificate of capacity shall expire with the expiration of the preliminary development order or within one year of the date of issuance of the preliminary development order, whichever is less; unless a final development order application is made. If the final development order application is not made, any reserved capacity shall be returned to the capacity pool and made available to other applicants. 
Capacity certificates will be extended under the same terms and conditions as the underlying development order. If a development order for which capacity was reserved is granted an extension, the capacity reservation is also extended. If an applicant does not request an extension, or the requested extension is denied and the development order expires, the certificate of capacity will also expire and the reserved capacity will be returned to the available capacity pool. 
No specific time limits will be placed on encumbrances as they will only last as long as the review process (i.e., until the final disposition of the application for the underlying development order). However, if issuance of the development order is not granted within six months of the date of application, the encumbrance will be returned to the capacity pool and made available to other applicants. Appeals to this six month time period may be made following procedures outlined in Section 14.6 of these regulations. 
    14.4.3. Final development order application concurrency test review. If the concurrency test has not been made through procedures identified in section 14.4.1 or 14.4.2 above, the applicant for a final development order shall apply for, and undergo, a concurrency test. All fees established for processing the concurrency test shall be paid prior to processing the final development order. 
The concurrency test shall be processed concurrently with the application for a final development order. The city's development review committee shall review and act on the request for capacity by recommending the concurrency test be: 
(a)  Passed and a certificate of capacity be issued; 
(b)  Failed and a certificate of capacity not be issued; or 
(c)  Passed for public facilities which have capacity, and failed for public facilities which do not have capacity with recommendations for: 
(1)  The applicant to amend his application to "balance" it with available capacity; 
(2)  The applicant to withdraw the application and resubmit at a later date; or 
(3)  The applicant to develop alternatives for providing the facilities to eliminate the insufficiency. 
The city manager, or designee, shall, at the time of approval of the final development order, issue a certificate of capacity and public facility capacity shall be reserved for the development in the amounts stated in the certificate. If the final development order is not issued, the applicant may appeal the decision and the public facility capacity shall remain encumbered until the results of the appeal are finalized. The ensure capacity reservation, all fees for reservation of capacity shall be paid as authorized in section 14.7 of these regulations. 
Capacity certificates will be extended under the same terms and conditions as the underlying development order. If a development order for which capacity was reserved is granted an extension, the capacity reservation is also extended. If an applicant does not request an extension, or the requested extension is denied and the development order expires, the certificate of capacity will also expire and the reserved capacity will be returned to the available capacity pool. 
No specific time limits will be placed on encumbrances as they will only last as long as the review process (i.e., until the final disposition of the application for the underlying development order). However, if issuance of the development order is not granted within six months of the date of application the encumbrance will be returned to the capacity pool and made available to other applicants. Appeals to this six month time period may be made following procedures outlined in section 14.6 of these regulations. 
    14.4.4. Nonbinding capacity test. If requested by an applicant, the city shall provide an informal, nonbinding capacity test. The purpose of this nonbinding test is to identify areas of potential deficiency for a proposed project. (Ord. No. 2013-03, §§ 2, 3, 2-28-2013) 
14.5. - Time limitations of certificates of capacity. 
    The certificate of capacity runs with and is tied to the final development order, or a formal extension of said development order, and expires with said development order unless: 
(a)  Development activity has occurred on site prior to expiration of the final development order and substantial construction activity has occurred within one year of the issuance of the final development order; or 
(b)  A certificate of occupancy is issued and/or site improvements have been accepted by the city engineer. 
For commercial, industrial, or multifamily site plans and/or building permits, capacity assignment is verified and the project is vested for concurrency when a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
For single-family and duplex subdivisions, the subdivision's capacity assignment is verified and the project is vested for concurrency when all site improvements have been accepted by the city engineer. The subdivision shall retain concurrency vested rights for all lots in the subdivision providing: 
 The first building permit is issued within one year of the completion and acceptance of site improvements; 
 Thirty-three percent of all allowable building permits are issued within two years of the completion and acceptance of site improvements; 
 Sixty-six percent of all allowable building permits are issued within three years of the completion and acceptance of site improvements; and 
 All allowable building permits are issued within four years of the completion and acceptance of site improvements. 
Building lots which have not been issued building permits within the time periods noted above will lose their concurrency vested right status and are required to undergo a separate concurrency test prior to issuance of a building permit. 
14.6. - Appeals. 
    An applicant may appeal a denial based on capacity determination on four grounds: 
(a)  A technical error; 
(b)  The applicant provides alternative data which has been rejected by the city; 
(c)  The developer provides evidence which demonstrates that the development proposed will not produce level of service (LOS) inadequacies below the existing LOS standard or due to an error in the concurrency test process; or 
(d)  Unwarranted delay in review that allowed capacity to be given to another applicant. 
If any capacity was encumbered prior to an appeal, it will remain encumbered during the appeal process. 
The appeal process shall begin with the city council, and from there progress to a hearing officer and then to the courts. 
If an applicant is denied a development order on concurrency grounds, they may resubmit the same application at any time upon payment of the concurrency test processing fees. 
14.7. - Establishment of fees and charges. 
    The city council hereby establishes that all concurrency test applications shall be levied a fee or charge. It is the intent that the city not be required to bear any part of the cost of a concurrency test and that the fees and costs involved in the processing of applications shall be borne by the applicant. 
    In addition, the city council may require that applicants for a certificate of capacity pay fees and charges to reserve their share of a public facility. These fees and charges may include payment of impact fees, connection charges, etc. 
    The fees and charges shall be authorized from time to time by resolution of the city council. The schedule of fees and charges shall be posted in the offices of the building official and the city manager. 
14.8. - Procedures for concurrency determination. 
    The following procedures are guidelines to be used in a concurrency test. Actual circumstances of a development (i.e., internal capture, special generator, use of water reuse systems, etc.) may alter these guidelines in the determination of concurrency. 
    14.8.1. Roads and traffic circulation. Peak hour generation/attraction shall be used in the determination of capacity for roadways. The development's peak hour impact shall be based on the development's total impacts during the P.M. peak hour of the adjacent street. The peak hour volumes published in the latest edition of the publication entitled Trip Generation, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, shall be used to determine the development's peak hour impacts. 
Only affected roadways within the city's network will be used in the concurrency test. If the development's impacts force an affected roadway below an adopted level of service (LOS), the concurrency test is failed. Provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency on roadways which are programmed for improvement are found later in this regulation. 
To determine a development's impact on the city's roadway network, the following procedures shall be used: 
(a)  For projects generating/attracting over 3,000 average daily trips (ADTs), an FSUTMS transportations model run is required. City staff may defer the execution of the model run if: 
(1)  The development's generator/attractor parameters (i.e., socio-economic data) does not exceed the socio-economic estimates for the development's attendant traffic zones used in modeling the city's future network; or 
(2)  A model run is untimely because of: 
(a)  Lack of data to calibrate the present year; and/or 
(b)  Capital budget process, proposing additions/improvements to the city's road network, is not complete. 
(b)  For projects generating/attracting between 150 and 3,000 ADTs, the publications Quick-Response Urban Travel Estimation Techniques and Transferable Parameters, Transportation Research Board, 1978, and Site Impact Traffic Evaluation Handbook, Federal Highway Administration, January 1985, shall be used as guidelines for a "table top" analysis of the proposed development's impact on the city's roadway network. city staff may defer the execution of the "table top" analysis if the development's generator/attractor parameters (i.e., socio-economic data) does not exceed the socio-economic estimates for the development's attendant traffic zones used in modeling the city's future network. 
(c)  For projects generating/attracting less than 150 ADTs, only those roadways within a one-half mile radius of the proposed development's entrance shall be assessed for concurrency. This "minimum impact standard" is based on the assumption that such small development has a minimal impact on the city's network beyond one-half mile of the development's entrance. 
(d)  Projects which attract or generate passerby trips (i.e., do not generate/attract new trip ends), or generate/attract trip ends of vehicle trips which have already been included, or vested, in the roadway capacity allocations, may be adjusted in the impact determination process to ensure vehicle trips are not "double counted" in roadway capacity reservation. 
The roadway/traffic circulation concurrency test shall be passed for a proposed development provided: 
(a)  All affected roadways have adequate peak hour capacity to serve the impacts of the proposed development; 
(b)  The development order is conditioned upon all affected roadways having adequate peak hour capacity prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements; or 
(c)  Improvements to provide additional peak hour capacity to serve the impacts of the proposed development are under construction at the time of issuance of the final development order. 
In addition, the roadway/traffic circulation concurrency test may be passed for a proposed development provided: 
(a)  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires the commencement of the actual construction of the facilities within one year of the issuance of the final development order; 
(b)  The necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract which provides for the commencement of the actual construction of the required facilities within one year of the issuance of the final development order; or 
(c)  The necessary facilities are included in the city's five-year capital improvement program (CIP) and the necessary facilities are scheduled to commence construction in or before the third year of the five-year capital improvement program. 
All roadways which are under the jurisdiction of another local government or government agency may be required to be assessed through the concurrency management system adopted by that government or agency. However, the city shall conduct a concurrency test for all roads within the city limits, regardless of who has administrative responsibility. Development orders shall be conditioned on the actual completion of public facilities by other providers. 
    14.8.2. Sanitary sewer. The level of service (LOS) as adopted in the city's comprehensive plan shall be used in the determination of capacity for sanitary sewer. 
If the development's impacts force the city's sanitary sewer system to operate above its adopted and permitted capacity (as identified in the support documentation for the sanitary sewer subelement of the city's comprehensive plan), the concurrency test is failed. Provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development will force the system to operate above capacity are found later in this regulation. 
The land use designation of the property on which the proposed development is to be located shall be used in the calculation of sanitary sewer demand. The following formulas shall be used: 
(a)  Residential land uses. 
Total Units × Adopted LOS = Sanitary Sewer Demand 
(b)  Commercial, professional, institutional, and industrial land uses. 
Daily Flow × Adopted, or comparable, LOS standard = Sanitary Sewer Demand 
Notes: 
(1) The daily flow shall be based upon the planned use and consistent flow provided in F.A.C. 64E-6.008 Table 1. If the use of the property is not specified, the applicant shall submit a sanitary sewer use estimate that is signed and sealed by a professional engineer and subject to approval by the city manager or his designee. 
(2) A comparable LOS standard is one which is calculated using the same assumptions as the adopted LOS standard. The assumptions for, and/or, the comparable LOS standard are those found in the support documentation for the sanitary sewer sub-element of the city's comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Mixed uses, planned unit developments, etc. 
Demand of Residential Uses as identified in subsection (a) above + Demand of Commercial, Professional, Institutional, and Industrial Land Uses as identified in subsection (b) above = Sanitary Sewer Demand 
The sanitary sewer concurrency test shall be passed for a proposed development provided: 
(a)  The necessary facilities are in place to serve the impacts of the proposed development; 
(b)  The final development order is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements; 
(c)  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time of issuance of the final development order; or 
(d)  The necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires and guarantees that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements. 
(Ord. No. 2006-153, § 2(14.8.2), 11-9-2006) 
    14.8.3. Solid waste. The level of service (LOS) as adopted in the city's comprehensive plan shall be used in the determination of capacity for solid waste. 
If the development's impacts force the city's, or other provider's, solid waste system to operate above its adopted and permitted capacity (as identified in the support documentation for the solid waste subelement of the city's comprehensive plan), the concurrency test is failed. Provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development will force the system to operate above capacity are found later in this regulation. 
The land use designation of the property on which the proposed development is to be located shall be used in the calculation of sanitary sewer demand. The following formulas shall be used: 
(a)  Residential land uses. 
Total Units × Persons per household × Adopted LOS × Percent of Residential to Total Customers, if applicable 
Notes: 
(1) Persons per household derived from the support documentation for the land use element of the city's comprehensive plan. 
(2) Percent of residential to total customers derived from the support documentation for the solid waste subelement of the city's comprehensive plan, or other methods determined by the city. The factor is used to allocate residential demand from total demand when the adopted LOS standard is based on population. For purposes of this section, the factor is assumed to be 0.90 or 90 percent unless justification is provided to prove otherwise. 
(b)  Commercial, professional, and institutional land uses. 
Total Gross Square Footage/1,000 × Commercial ERUC Factor &times Adopted, or comparable, LOS standard 
Notes: 
(1) The commercial ERUC factor is used to equate commercial uses with residential uses. For purposes of this section, the factor is assumed to be 0.50 or 50 percent unless justification is provided to prove otherwise. 
(2) A comparable LOS standard is one which is calculated using the same assumptions as the adopted LOS standard. The assumptions for, and/or, the comparable LOS standard are those found in the support documentation for the solid waste subelement of the city's comprehensive plan, or other methods determined by the city. 
(c)  Industrial land uses. 
Total Gross Square Footage/1,000 × Industrial ERUC Factor × Adopted, or comparable, LOS standard 
Notes: 
(1) The industrial ERUC factor is used to equate commercial uses with residential uses. For purposes of this section, the factor is assumed to be 0.30 or 30 percent unless justification is provided to prove otherwise. 
(2) A comparable LOS standard is one which is calculated using the same assumptions as the adopted LOS standard. The assumptions for, and/or, the comparable LOS standard are those found in the support documentation for the solid waste subelement of the city's comprehensive plan, or other methods determined by the city. 
(d)  Mixed use, planned unit developments, etc. 
Demand of residential uses as identified in subsection (a) above + Demand of Commercial Uses as identified in subsection (b) above + Demand of Industrial Uses as identified in subsection (c) above 
The solid waste concurrency test shall be passed for a proposed development provided: 
(a)  The necessary facilities are in place to serve the impacts of the proposed development; 
(b)  The final development order is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements; 
(c)  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time of issuance of the final development order; or 
(d)  The necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires and guarantees that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements. 
All solid waste facilities which are under the jurisdiction of another local government or government agency may be required to be assessed through the concurrency management system adopted by that government or agency. However, the city shall conduct a concurrency test for solid waste regardless of who has administrative or legal responsibility for solid waste facilities. Development orders shall be conditioned on the actual completion of public facilities by other providers. 
    14.8.4. Drainage. Two standards are used for the determination of concurrency for drainage. They are stormwater runoff quantity and quality. 
In most circumstances, new development is required to construct drainage facilities which meet the requirements of F.A.C. ch. 17-25, without exception or exemption. This requirement meets or exceeds the city's adopted level of service (LOS) for both quality and quantity and would allow the development to pass the concurrency test. 
In addition, and as required by the city engineer as a condition of development order approval, in order to pass a concurrency test a development may be required to make improvements to major drainage systems which are impacted by the development. These improvements are to be identified in the city's comprehensive plan and/or stormwater master plan. Improvements include, but are not limited to: 
(a)  Construction of, or improvement to, major basin outfall facilities; and/or 
(b)  Dedication of easements or rights-of-way for future improvements. 
In the area of redevelopment where an existing development generates stormwater runoff directly to the basin, with no on-site stormwater facilities, the following guidelines shall apply: 
(a)  If the identified outfall of the development/redevelopment meets the adopted LOS standard, then retrofit of the site to F.A.C. ch. 17-25 standards is not required. 
(b)  If the identified outfall of the development/redevelopment does not meet the adopted LOS standard, then: 
(1)  Retrofit is not required if redevelopment does not change pre- and post-stormwater drainage directions; and 
(2)  Retrofit is required for only that portion of storm runoff which exceeds the existing stormwater runoff amounts (the incremental increase only). 
(c)  For those sites where retrofit is impossible (i.e., central business district), and/or highly impractical (i.e., those built up areas of the city, original grid area, etc.) that are served by existing stormwater drainage system constructed prior to February 1, 1982, retrofitting will not be required. 
(d)  In all cases, redevelopment is urged to retrofit the site to meet or exceed the requirements of F.A.C. ch. 17-25, with no exceptions or exemptions. 
    14.8.5. Potable water. The level of service (LOS), as adopted in the city's comprehensive plan, shall be used in the determination of capacity for potable water. 
If the development's impacts force the city's potable water system to operate above its adopted and permitted treatment capacity (as identified in the support documentation for the potable water subelement of the city's comprehensive plan), the concurrency test is failed. Provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development will force the system to operate above its treatment capacity are found later in this regulation. 
The land use designation of the property on which the proposed development is to be located shall be used in the calculation of potable water demand. The following formulas shall be used: 
(a)  Residential land uses. 
Total Units × Adopted LOS = Potable Water Demand 
(b)  Commercial, professional, institutional, and industrial land uses. 
Daily Flow × 1.13 × Adopted, or comparable, LOS standard = Potable Water Demand 
Notes: 
(1) The daily flow shall be based upon the planned use and consistent flow provided in F.A.C. 64E-6.008 Table 1. If the use of the property is not specified, the applicant shall submit a water use estimate that is signed and sealed by a professional engineer and subject to approval by the city manager or his designee. 
(2) A comparable LOS standard is one which is calculated using the same assumptions as the adopted LOS standard. The assumptions for, and/or, the comparable LOS standard are those found in the support documentation for the potable water sub-element of the city's comprehensive plan, or other methods determined by the city. 
(c)  Mixed use, planned unit developments, etc. 
Demand of Residential Uses as identified in subsection (a) above + Demand of Commercial, Professional, Institutional, and Industrial Land Uses as identified in subsection (b) above = Potable Water Demand 
The potable water concurrency test shall be passed for a proposed development provided: 
(a)  The necessary facilities are in place to serve the impacts of the proposed development; 
(b)  The final development order is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements; 
(c)  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time of issuance of the final development order; or 
(d)  The necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires and guarantees that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements. 
(Ord. No. 2006-153, § 2(14.8.5), 11-9-2006) 
    14.8.6. Parks and recreation. Five standards, identified in the city's comprehensive plan, are used for determining concurrency for parks and recreation. These are: 
(a)  Location of the proposed development relative to a regional park facility; 
(b)  Location of the proposed development relative to a community park facility; 
(c)  Location of the proposed development relative to a neighborhood park facility; 
(d)  Population served by the neighborhood park facility; and 
(e)  Population served by recreation facilities. 
Only residential land uses are required to undergo a concurrency test for parks and recreation. 
For determining whether the proposed development meets the levels of service (LOS) for the location of a development of a regional, community, and neighborhood parks as adopted in the city's comprehensive plan, the distance from the nearest edge of the proposed development to the nearest edge of the nearest park facility shall be used. If the proposed development is located further than the adopted distance, the concurrency test is failed. Provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development is beyond the adopted allowed distance are found later in this regulation. 
For determining whether the proposed development meets the adopted levels of service (LOS) for the population served by a neighborhood park and for recreational facilities, the existing population served by the park and all facilities plus any capacity certificates for developments which will be served by the park and all facilities, shall be used in determining whether the proposed development will exceed the level of service standard. Persons per household by land use type, as identified in the support documentation for the land use element of the city's comprehensive plan, shall be used to determine population. if the proposed development's population forces a recreational facility or neighborhood park need below the adopted level of service (LOS), the concurrency test is failed. Provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development will adversely affect a level of service standard are found later in this regulation. 
The parks and recreation concurrency test shall be passed for a proposed development provided: 
(a)  The necessary facilities and parks are in place to serve the impacts of the proposed development;

    14.8.7. Public school concurrency. 
1.  It is the intent of this section to implement the goals, objectives, policies and standards of the city comprehensive plan, as amended, and particularly, the public school facilities element and to implement the "Interlocal Agreement between The Board of County Commissioners of Osceola County, Florida, the City of Kissimmee, the City of St. Cloud, and the School Board of Osceola County, Florida, Relating to School Concurrency and the Planning and Coordination of Public Schools" (hereinafter referred to the "agreement"). 
2.  Unless otherwise provided herein, this section shall apply to all development orders with any residential component and any amendment to an existing development order to the extent that the student generation is increased above what was previously approved, or any other official action of the city having the effect of permitting residential development of land. The following residential uses shall be considered exempt from the requirements of school concurrency (unless the development approval for such use required it to meet school concurrency): 
a.  Single-family lots of record having received final plat approval prior to the effective date of the city's school concurrency ordinance or other lots which the city has determined are vested based on statutory or common law vesting. 
b.  Multifamily residential developments having received final site plan approval prior to the effective date of the city's school concurrency ordinance or other multifamily residential development which the city has determined is vested based on statutory or common law vesting. 
c.  Amendments to residential development approvals issued prior to the effective date of the city's school concurrency ordinance, which do not increase the number of residential units or change the type of residential units proposed or is subject to a covenant or deed related to long term age restrictions. 
d.  De minimis developments not exceeding five dwelling units. 
3.  To measure the capacity of school facilities, the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH) shall be used. School facilities shall not include portables or relocatables as permanent capacity for concurrency calculations. To ensure the capacity of schools is sufficient to support student growth at the adopted level of service for each year of the five-year planning period and through the long term planning period, the following level of service standard shall be established for all schools of each type of school: 
a.  Elementary: 110 percent of permanent department of education FISH capacity. 
b.  Middle: 110 percent of permanent department of education FISH capacity. 
c.  High: 110 percent of permanent department of education FISH capacity. 
d.  Magnet and school of choice: 110 percent of enrollment quota as established by the school board or court-ordered agreements and as adjusted by the school board annually. 
e.  Other: K-8, sixth grade centers, ninth grade centers, 6-12 are at 110 percent of permanent department of education FISH capacity. 
4.  The following procedures will be utilized to obtain a school concurrency determination from the county school board and to allow for mitigation if a development proposal is determined not to be in compliance. 
5.  A completed application provided by and delivered to the county school board must be submitted concurrent with a final development order application by an applicant proposing residential development. The application at a minimum shall include the following information: 
a.  Proposed development name. 
b.  Application type. 
c.  Intake date. 
d.  Signature of agent. 
e.  Number of residential units broken down by unit type. 
f.  Property deed. 
g.  Consent form. 
h.  Phasing plan (if applicable). 
i.  Site plan. 
j.  Survey. 
k.  Justification statement. 
l.  Location map. 
6.  Within three days of submitting to the school board, the applicant must present a copy of the application to the city. The city shall provide a determination of authenticity to the school board within three days of receiving the application. 
7.  The school board shall review the application and base the concurrency determination on standards outlined in article 4 of the agreement. 
8.  No final development order shall be approved unless a letter of determination of concurrency has been issued by the school board finding the development in compliance. 
9.  Once the school board has reviewed the application it shall issue a letter of determination of concurrency within 30 days if the impact of the proposed developments student growth does not cause the adopted level of service to be exceeded. 
10.  If the development is not in compliance, the letter of determination of concurrency shall detail why the development is not in compliance and shall offer the applicant the opportunity to enter into a 90-day negotiation period in accordance with the provisions of article 5 of the agreement. 
11.  During the 90-day negotiation period, the applicant shall meet with the school board in an effort to mitigate the impact from the development. 
a.  Mitigation shall be limited to those options which the school board recognizes and assumes the responsibility to operate and which will maintain the adopted level of service standards for the first five years from receipt of the school board's letter of determination of concurrency. 
b.  The city shall have the opportunity to review the mitigation options. 
c.  The city council shall approve all proportionate share agreements. 
12.  If mitigation is not agreed to, the letter of determination of concurrency shall detail why mitigation proposals were rejected and detail why the development is not in compliance. In this case, no development order shall be issued. 
13.  If the school board and the applicant agree to mitigation, the letter of determination of concurrency shall be issued based on the agreed mitigation measures and an agreement between the school board, the city and the applicant. 
14.  A letter of determination for school concurrency, finding the development in compliance, issued by the school board shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance unless extended by the school board. Once the development order is issued, the concurrency determination shall run with the development order. 
15.  If the letter of determination of concurrency requires conditions or mitigation to be placed on the development, the development order issued by the city shall incorporate conditions as set forth by the school board. 
16.  If the letter of determination of concurrency requires the development to be phased to school construction or other mitigation, the conditions of approval of the development order shall reflect the phasing requirements by withholding subsequent development orders for building permits. 
17.  In no case shall a development order be issued unless provisions are made through conditions of approval or by agreement between the school board, the city and the applicant to provide performance security when required.

Article XVI - MOBILITY FEE 
(Ord. No. 2004-54, 5-27-2004; Ord. No. 2017-08, 2-23-2017) 

16.1. - Purpose and authority. 
A.  The City Council of the City of St. Cloud recognizes the urban nature of the city and that growth and development in the city will require that the capacity of the city's multimodal transportation be expanded in order to maintain adequate levels of service and transportation choices, and that without a funded program for multimodal transportation improvements, new growth and development would have to be limited in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of St. Cloud. 
B.  The city council has completed a study updating the type, amount and cost of projected multimodal transportation improvements needed to serve new growth and development. 
C.  The purpose of this article is to ensure that new growth and development that is approved by the city pays a fair share of the costs of multimodal transportation facilities needed to serve new growth and development. 
D.  This article, which requires new development to pay reasonable mobility fees, requires new development to pay its pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new multimodal transportation facilities created by new growth and development, which is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the City of St. Cloud Plan, as amended, and ensuing capital improvements program is in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
E.  Florida statutes encourages local governments that have repealed transportation concurrency to: 
1.  Develop tools and techniques including: 
a.  Adoption of long-term strategies to facilitate development patterns that support multimodal solutions, including urban design, and appropriate land use mixes, including intensity and density; 
b.  Adoption of an area-wide level of service not dependent on any single road segment function; and 
c.  Establishing multimodal level of service standards that rely primarily on non-vehicular modes of transportation where existing or planned community design will provide adequate level of mobility. 
F.  Adopt an alternative mobility funding system that uses one or more of the foregoing tools and techniques. 
G.  The technical data, findings and conclusions herein are based on the report entitled "City of St. Cloud Mobility Fee Study," prepared by Tindale-Oliver & Associates, and dated January 2017 (referred to herein as the "Technical Report"). 
(Ord. No. 2017-08 , § II, 2-23-2017) 
16.2. - Adoption of technical report as basis of mobility fees. 
    The city hereby adopts and incorporates by reference, the Technical Report, which among other things, supports the rates and reasonableness of the mobility fees imposed by this article. 
(Ord. No. 2017-08 , § II, 2-23-2017) 
16.3. - Interpretations of article and fee schedule. 
    Interpretation of the provisions of this article shall be made by the director. 
(Ord. No. 2017-08 , § II, 2-23-2017) 
16.4. - Effect on other regulations and requirements. 
A.  This article may not be construed to alter, amend, or modify any provision of the city's zoning code and City Code. Other provisions of the city's zoning code and City Code shall be operative and remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any contrary provisions, definitions, or intentions that are or may be expressed or implied in this article. 
B.  The payment of mobility fees shall not entitle the applicant to a certificate of occupancy unless all other applicable land use, land development, zoning, planning, concurrency, and other applicable requirements, standards, and conditions have been met. Such other requirements, standards, and conditions are independent of the requirement for payment of mobility fees required by this article. 
C.  This article, including the specific mobility fee ordinances for particular public facilities, shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density or intensity of development, design and improvement standards, or other applicable standards or requirements of the zoning code. 
D.  The payment of mobility fees does not ensure compliance with the city's land development regulations, including regulations relating to transportation corridor management, access management, substandard roads, secondary access, timing and phasing, and, where applicable, development of regional mobility review. However, if such regulations require transportation mitigation for the same impacts addressed through the payment of mobility fees, such regulations shall be deemed to provide for mobility fee credit against mobility fees consistent with state and federal law and this article. 
(Ord. No. 2017-08 , § II, 2-23-2017) 
16.5. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

16.7. - Collection of mobility fees. 
A.  Collection. Mobility fees required by this article shall be assessed against new development/redevelopment and collected in full prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the city. The city may authorize the payment of mobility fees at another point in the development of the property only pursuant to a fair share fee agreement as provided in this section. The city commission may establish and collect an administrative charge to offset its actual costs of mobility fee collection by adoption of a resolution. 
B.  Fair share fee agreements. At any time prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the owner of property may enter into a fair share fee agreement with the city providing for payment of mobility fees imposed by this article.

(Ord. No. 2017-08 , § II, 2-23-2017) 
16.9. - Alternative calculation of mobility fees. 
    Any person who initiates any development may choose to provide an alternative calculation of the public facilities impacts of the proposed development. The alternative calculation study may be used to determine whether a fair share of the public facilities costs necessitated by the proposed development should be less than the fees set forth in this article or, if a particular use or combination of uses is not identified in this article, what fee the use should pay. Only the demand component of the technical calculation of the mobility fee can be challenged during the alternative calculation study. Of the four demand component variables, vehicle trips to person trips factor is a citywide average, which will not be altered while the other three components can be reviewed as part the alternative calculation study. Technical details of approach, methodology, procedures and other matters relating to the alternative fee calculation shall be discussed with and approved by the director prior to proceeding with the study. 
(Ord. No. 2017-08 , § II, 2-23-2017) 
16.10. - Credits. 
A.  Any person who initiates any development may apply for a credit against the mobility fees imposed by this article for any contribution, payment, construction, or dedication of land accepted and received by the city for public facilities, not otherwise required in order to obtain development approval, consistent with the capital improvements program, including all public facilities capital costs. 
B.  Development agreements entered into prior to the adoption of this article which contained public facility improvements may be entitled to a credit under the provisions of this section if the improvement is a public facility and is consistent with the capital improvements program. 
C.  A developer may apply for a credit against the mobility fees imposed by this article upon development of a vacant parcel, whereby the new building(s) or structure(s) does not produce a higher trip generation rate than a previously existing building or structure on the subject parcel. It is the responsibility of the developer to provide evidence to the director as to the highest intensity building or structure previously constructed upon the parcel by which to calculate the reduction in the total amount of mobility fees otherwise required for the subject parcel. In the event that this evidence cannot be ascertained, the city shall use the trip generation rate of the last known building or structure on the parcel to determine whether payment of additional mobility fees apply. In the event the parcel to be developed has been, or may be, annexed into the city, this credit shall be based upon recognition of the trip generation of the highest intensity building or structure in existence prior to the annexation, at the time of annexation, or post-annexation. 
D.  Except as limited above, if an applicant is entitled to a credit, such credit shall be equal to the dollar value of the cost of the public facilities contributed, paid for, constructed, or dedicated to the city, based on the following criteria: 
1.  The actual cost, or estimated cost of improvements based on recent bid sheet information of the city; and 
2.  A qualified appraisal of the fair market value of any land. 
E.  The property owner shall initiate a determination of entitlement to credit by submitting a proposed credit agreement to the director. The credit agreement shall include the following information: 
1.  A proposed plan of specific public facility improvements, prepared and certified by a duly qualified and licensed Florida engineer; and 
2.  The estimated costs for the suggested public facilities improvements consistent with the definition of public facilities capital costs, which shall be based on local information for similar public facilities improvements, along with a construction timetable for the completion of such improvements. 
F.  The proposed credit agreement shall be prepared by qualified professionals in the field of planning and engineering, impact analysis, and economics, as related to the particular mobility fee to be credited. 
G.  Within ten business days of receipt of the proposed credit agreement, the director shall determine if the proposal is complete. If it is determined that the proposed credit agreement is not complete, the director shall send a written statement to the applicant outlining the deficiencies. The director shall take no further action on the proposed credit agreement until all deficiencies have been corrected or otherwise settled. 
H.  Once the director determines the credit agreement is complete, he or she shall review it within 30 business days, and shall recommend to the city commission that the proposed credit agreement be approved if it is determined that the proposed public facility improvement is consistent with the capital improvements program, and the proposed costs for the suggested public facility improvement are professionally acceptable and fairly assess the cost for the capital improvement. If the director determines that either the suggested public facilities improvement is not consistent with the capital improvements program or that the proposed costs are not acceptable, he or she may propose a suggested public facility improvement similar to that proposed, but consistent with the provisions of this article. 
I.  If the proposed credit agreement is approved by the city commission, a credit agreement shall be prepared and signed by the applicant and the city. The credit agreement shall specifically outline the public facility improvement that will be constructed by the applicant, the time by which it shall be completed, and the dollar credit the applicant shall receive for construction of the public facilities improvement. 
J.  Within ten business days after execution by the city, the credit agreement shall be recorded with the Osceola County. 
K.  This article shall not be interpreted in a manner affecting the rights of parties to agreements entered into in connection with the payment of transportation mobility fees, including but not limited to, development agreements and consent agreements. All such agreements shall remain in full force and effect. Development on property otherwise entitled to a transportation mobility fee credit under such an agreement shall be entitled to a mobility fee credit in the amount specified in such agreement if: 
1.  The improvement generating the transportation mobility fee credit was included in the transportation element of the city's comprehensive plan on the date of the agreement, and 
2.  The parties, successors or assigns to the agreement acknowledge in writing that granting the mobility fee credit satisfies the city's obligation under such agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

Article XVII - PARK AND RECREATION IMPACT FEE 
(Ord. No. 2007-64, 10-25-2007) 

17.1. - Authority and applicability. 
A.  The city council has the authority to adopt this article pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2, of the constitution of the state, and F.S. ch. 166, and article II of the Charter Laws of the city. 
B.  This article shall apply within the municipal boundaries of the city. 
17.2. - Intents and purposes. 
A.  This article is intended to assist in the implementation of the city comprehensive plan. 
B.  The purpose of this article is to regulate the use and development of land so as to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditures necessary to provide park lands and recreation facilities within the municipal boundaries of the city. 
C.  The city council has determined and recognized through adoption of this impact fee article, that new growth and development which the city will experience shall necessitate extensive improvements, capital facilities and infrastructure, including park lands and recreational facilities. In order to finance the necessary new capital costs and improvements, several combined methods of financing shall be employed, one of which shall impose a regulatory impact fee on new growth and development which does not exceed the reasonably anticipated costs of the capital expenditures required to serve future growth and new development by providing for needed police and for services and related facilities. 
D.  Implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay an impact fee that does not exceed the reasonably anticipated capital costs incurred to serve new growth and development is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the policy and intent of its comprehensive plan, and is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
E.  The purpose of this article is to enable the city to allow growth and development to proceed in the city in compliance with the comprehensive plan, and to regulate growth and development so as to require growth and development to share in the burdens of growth by paying for the reasonably anticipated capital costs attributable to growth and new development. 
F.  It is not the purpose of this article to collect fees from growth and development in excess of the cost of the reasonably anticipated capital requirements needed to serve the new growth and development. The city council hereby finds that this article has approached the problem of determining impact fees in a conservative and reasonable manner. This article shall result in only partial recoupment of the capital expenditures attributable to future growth and new development. Impact fees shall not be utilized to correct any existing deficiencies in any fashion whatsoever. 
17.3. - Rules of construction.

17.5. - Impact fee imposed. 
A.  Any person who, after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, seeks to develop land within the city requiring the issuance of a certificate of capacity, a building permit, or an extension of a building permit issued prior to that date for any facility structure or use, including permits and extensions thereof for mobile homes, or otherwise make an improvement to land which shall generate additional demand on park and recreation facilities, is hereby required to pay a park and recreation impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article.

17.6. - Computation of the amount of park and recreation impact fee. 
A.  The applicable amount of the park and recreation impact fee for the structure, land development or otherwise shall be taken from the impact fee schedule as calculated by the city manager and confirmed by this article and future resolution of the city council. 
B.  From time to time, the city manager shall calculate the amount of park and recreation impact base fees for each of the various categories established below: 
BASE FEE CATEGORIES Land Use Type Unit Used 
in Calculation Housing Unit Type Single-Family Dwelling Unit Multifamily Dwelling Unit  
C.  The variables (i.e., park and recreation impact fee parameters) as set forth in the impact fee program report are determinative in the calculation of the park and recreation impact fees. 
D.  In his calculations of the park and recreation impact fee amounts, the city manager, or his designee, shall use the calculation formula and the impact fee schedule contained in the impact fee program report, incorporated herein. The calculation formula and the impact fee schedule may be changed by resolution from time to time adopted, with the values of the park and recreation impact fee parameters established therein. 
E.  To the extent applicable, the impact fee calculation formula shall include a credit for local option sales tax and other tax payments, which may be used in funding park and recreation capital costs and facilities. The park and recreation gross impact fee may be discounted by a percentage, which shall be confirmed by this article and/or future resolution of the city council from time to time. The park and recreation impact fee schedule and the schedule as may be discounted shall be maintained in the office of the city manager. The purpose of these credits and discounts are to encourage the use of such schedule in order to avoid administrative costs required to process independent fee calculations and studies. 
(1)  If a building permit is requested for mixed uses, then the fee shall be determined by using the applicable schedule and apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the applicable schedule. 
(2)  For applications for an extension of a building permit or an extension of a permit for mobile home installation, the amount of the fee is the difference between that fee then applicable and any amount already paid or incurred pursuant to this article. 
(3)  If the type of development activity that a building permit is applied for is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the city manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The city manager shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the city comprehensive plan, support documentation of the city comprehensive plan, and the city land development code. If the city manager determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the applicable fee schedule, then the city manager shall determine the appropriate fee by considering demographic or other documentation which is available from federal, state, local and regional authorities by applying the impact fee formulae presented in the impact fee program report. 
(4)  In the case of change of use, redevelopment or expansion or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit or permit for mobile home installation, the impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase, if any, in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. The city manager shall be guided in this determination by the sources and agencies referred to in the impact fee report. 
F.  If a fee payer opts not to have the impact fee determined according to paragraph A. of this section, then the fee payer shall prepare and submit to the city manager an independent fee calculation study for the land development activity for which a building permit or permit for mobile home installation is sought. The independent fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats in a manner and type as found in the report entitled FY 2016 Impact Fee Study dated July 20, 2017, or in the most recent park and recreation impact fee methodology as such methodology may be amended from time to time, and such independent fee shall be calculated by applying the impact fee formula presented in the Impact Fee Study Report of July 20, 2017. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Park and recreation land and facilities, and/or cost studies. 
(a)  Documentation of cost of land and/or facilities. 
(b)  Documentation of direct costs to equip such land and facilities, including, but not limited to, the costs of courts, fields, pools, paths and equipment and service facilities necessary to maintain the established level of service. 
(2)  Economic documentation studies. 
(a)  Documentation of the specific demographics applicable to and appropriate for the proposed land development activity. 
(b)  Documentation of credits attributable to the proposed land development activity which can be expected to be available to replace the portion of the service volume generated by the proposed land development activity. 
    Independent fee calculation studies shall be prepared and presented by professionals qualified in their respective fields. The city manager shall consider the documentation submitted by the fee payer but is not required to accept such documentation as he/she shall reasonably deem to be inaccurate or not reliable and may, in the alternative, require the fee payer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is not presented, the fee payer shall pay park and recreation impact fees based upon the schedules referenced in paragraph A. of this section. If an acceptable independent fee calculation is presented, the city manager may adjust the fee to that appropriate to the particular development. The adjustment may include a credit against the fee otherwise payable up to ten percent for park and recreation facilities constructed or otherwise set aside for park and recreation purposes by the fee payer which serve the same purposes and functions as set forth for park and recreation facilities in the city comprehensive plan, provided that adequate documentation is presented which ensures that any internal capture of park and recreation demand is greater than off-site park and recreation demand. Determinations made by the city manager pursuant to this paragraph may be appealed to the city council by filing a written request with the city manager within ten days of the city manager's determination.

Any claim of exemption shall be made no later than the time of application for a building permit or permit for mobile home installation. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
B.  Credits. 
(1)  No credit shall be given for site-related improvements or site-related dedications, except as provided for in this article or in the impact fee report. 
(2)  Park and recreation capital improvements may be offered by the fee payer as total or partial payment of the required fee.

If the city manager accepts such an offer, whether the acceptance is before or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the credit shall be determined and provided for in the following manner: 
(a)  Credit for the dedication of non-site-related park and recreation lands shall be valued at (i) 115 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser, or (ii) the purchase price of said land as reflected in the closing documents of the most recent transfer, or (iii) at the option of the fee payer, by fair market value established by private appraisers acceptable to the city. Credit for the dedication of park and recreation land shall be provided when the property has been conveyed at no charge to, and accepted by, the city in a manner satisfactory to the city council. 
(b)  Applicants for credit for construction of non-site-related improvements shall submit acceptable engineering drawings and specifications, and construction cost estimates to the city manager. The city manager shall determine credit for park and recreation capital improvement facilities based upon either these cost estimates or upon alternative engineering criteria and construction cost estimates if the city manager determines that such estimates submitted by the applicant are either unreliable or inaccurate. The city manager shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant shall sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate and return such signed document to the city manager before credit shall be given. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 days shall nullify the credit. 
(c)  Except as provided in subparagraph (d), credit for construction of non-site-related improvements against impact fees otherwise due shall not be provided until: 
(1)  The construction is completed and accepted by the city, or other jurisdiction as provided by interlocal agreement having been executed pursuant to section 17.8(B), and section 17.10(A); 
(2)  A suitable maintenance and warranty bond is received and approved by the city attorney and the city engineer, when the project is under the jurisdiction of the city; or a letter from the applicable jurisdiction stating the construction has meet all warranty requirements of said jurisdiction; and

(d)  Credit may be provided before completion of specified park and recreation improvements if adequate assurances are given by the applicant that the standards set out in subparagraph (c) shall be met and if the fee payer posts security as provided below for the costs of such construction. Security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement shall be posted with and approved by the city attorney in an amount determined by the city manager consistent with then current city Land Development Code. If the park and recreation facility or improvement construction project will not be constructed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the city manager, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten percent compounded for each year of the life of the security. The security shall be reviewed and approved, as to form, by the city attorney prior to acceptance of the security by the city manager. If the park and recreation facility or improvement project is not to be completed within two years of the date of the fee payers offer, the city council shall approve the project and its scheduled completion date prior to the acceptance of the offer by the city manager. 
(3)  Any claim for credit shall be made no later than the time of application for a building permit or permit for mobile home installation. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.

18.5. - Impact fee imposed. 
A.  Any person who, after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, seeks to develop land within the city requiring the issuance of a certificate of capacity, a building permit, or an extension of a building permit issued prior to that date for any facility structure or use, including permits and extensions thereof for mobile homes, or otherwise make an improvement to land which shall generate additional demand on police and fire services and related facilities, is hereby required to pay a public safety services impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
B.  No certificate of capacity, building permit, or an extension of a building permit issued prior to that date for any facility structure or use, including permits and extensions thereof for mobile homes, or for any activity requiring payment of an impact fee as required by this article shall be issued without incurring an impact fee liability. The fee amount shall be that fee in effect, pursuant to section 18.6, at the time of payment. 
C.  No extension of a building permit for any facility structure or use, permit for mobile home installation, or for any activity requiring payment of an impact fee as required by this article issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be granted unless the impact fee liability set forth in subsection (B) above is incurred. 
18.6. - Computation of the amount of public safety services impact fee. 
A.  The applicable amount of the public safety services impact fee for the structure, land development or otherwise shall be taken from the impact fee schedule as calculated by the city manager and confirmed by resolution of the city council. 
B.  From time to time, the city manager shall calculate the amount of public safety services impact base fees for each of the various categories established below: 
BASE FEE CATEGORIES Land Use Type Unit Used 
in Calculation Residential Single Family Dwelling Unit Multifamily Dwelling Unit Nonresidential 1,000 Square Feet  
C.  The variables (i.e., public safety services impact fee parameters) as set forth in the impact fee program report are determinative in the calculation of the public safety services impact fees. 
D.  In his calculations of the public safety impact fee amounts, the city manager, or his designee, shall use the calculation formula and the impact fee schedule contained in the impact fee program report, incorporated herein. The calculation formula and the impact fee schedule may be changed by resolution from time to time adopted, with the values of the public safety impact fee parameters established therein. 
E.  To the extent applicable, the impact fee calculation formula shall include a credit for local option sales tax and other tax payments, which may be used in funding public safety capital costs and facilities. The public safety gross impact fee may be discounted by a percentage, which shall be confirmed by resolution of the city council from time to time. The public safety impact fee schedule and the schedule as may be discounted shall be maintained in the office of the city manager. The purpose of these credits and discounts are to encourage the use of such schedule in order to avoid administrative costs required to process independent fee calculations and studies. 
(1)  If a building permit is requested for mixed uses, then the fee shall be determined by using the applicable schedule and apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the applicable schedule. 
(2)  For applications for an extension of a building permit or an extension of a permit for mobile home installation, the amount of the fee is the difference between that fee then applicable and any amount already paid or incurred pursuant to this article. 
(3)  If the type of development activity that a building permit is applied for is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the city manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The city manager shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the city comprehensive plan, support documentation of the city comprehensive plan, and the city land development code. If the city manager determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the applicable fee schedule, then the city manager shall determine the appropriate fee by considering demographic or other documentation which is available from federal, state, local and regional authorities by applying the impact fee formulae presented in the impact fee program report. 
(4)  In the case of change of use, redevelopment or expansion or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit or permit for mobile home installation, the impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase, if any, in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. The city manager shall be guided in this determination by the sources and agencies referred to in the impact fee report. 
F.  If a fee payer opts not to have the impact fee determined according to paragraph A. of this section, then the fee payer shall prepare and submit to the city manager an independent fee calculation study for the land development activity for which a building permit or permit for mobile home installation is sought. The independent fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats in a manner and type as found in the report entitled FY 2016 Impact Fee Study dated July 20, 2017, or in the most recent municipal/public safety impact fee methodology as such methodology may be amended from time to time, and such independent fee shall be calculated by applying the impact fee formula presented in the impact fee study report of July 20, 2017. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made, including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Public safety facilities, engineering, and/or cost studies. 
(a)  Documentation of cost of land and/or facilities. 
(b)  Documentation of direct costs to equip a fulltime police officer and/or firefighter, including but not limited to, the costs of vehicles, and service facilities necessary to maintain the established level of service and responses times. 
(2)  Economic documentation studies. 
(a)  Documentation of the specific demographics applicable to and appropriate for the proposed land development activity. 
(b)  Documentation of credits attributable to the proposed land development activity which can be expected to be available to replace the portion of the service volume generated by the proposed land development activity. 
    Independent fee calculation studies shall be prepared and presented by professionals qualified in their respective fields. The city manager shall consider the documentation submitted by the fee payer but is not required to accept such documentation as he shall reasonably deem to be inaccurate or not reliable and may, in the alternative, require the fee payer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is not presented, the fee payer shall pay public safety impact fees based upon the schedules referenced in paragraph A. of this section. If an acceptable independent fee calculation is presented, the city manager may adjust the fee to that appropriate to the particular development. The adjustment may include a credit against the fee otherwise payable up to ten percent, for public safety facilities constructed or otherwise set aside for public safety purposes by the fee payer which serve the same purposes and functions as set forth for public safety facilities in the city comprehensive plan, provided that adequate documentation is presented which ensures that any internal capture of public safety demand is greater than off-site public safety demand. Determinations made by the city manager pursuant to this paragraph may be appealed to the city council by filing a written request with the city manager within ten days of the city manager's determination. 
(Ord. No. 2017-43 , § 2, 9-28-2017) 
18.7. - Payment of fee. 
A.  The fee payer shall pay the public safety impact fee required by this article to the city prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or a permit for mobile home installation.

Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected. 
E.  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of capital facilities for which public safety impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the type described in paragraph (A) of this section and are located within the appropriate impact fee districts created by section 18.8 or as provided in paragraphs (B) and (D) of this section. 
F.  At least once each fiscal period, and as a part of the city's comprehensive plan capital improvement element, the city manager shall present to the city council a proposed capital improvement program for public safety, assigning funds, including any accrued interest from the public safety impact fee fund to specific public safety improvement projects and related expenses. Monies, including any accrued interest not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the same public safety impact fee fund until the next fiscal period except as provided by the refund provisions of this article. 
G.  Funds may be used to provide refunds as described in section 18.11. 
H.  The general fund of the city shall be entitled to retain not more than five percent of the funds collected, and interest thereon, as compensation for the expense of collecting the fee and administering this article. 
18.11. - Refund of fees paid. 
    If a building permit or permit for mobile home installation expires without commencement of construction and the impact fee has been paid, then the fee payer may be entitled to a refund, without interest, of the impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance except that the general fund of the city shall retain ten percent of the fee, not to exceed $1,000.00, to offset a portion of the costs of collection and refund. The fee payer shall submit an application for such a refund within 30 days of the expiration of the permit. 
18.12. - Exemptions and credits. 
A.  The following shall be exempted from payment of the impact fee: 
(1)  Alterations of an existing building where no additional residential units or building square footage is created, where the use is not changed, and where no additional public safety demand will be generated over and above those generated by the existing use. 
(2)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures which will not generate additional public safety demand over and above that generated by the principal building or use of the land. 
(3)  The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building or structure with a new building or structure of the same size and use, provided that no additional public safety demand will be generated by the replacement. 
(4)  The installation of a replacement mobile home on a lot or other such site when a public safety impact fee for such mobile home site has previously been paid pursuant to this article or where a mobile home legally existed on such site on or prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, provided that no additional public safety demand will be generated by the replacement. 
Any claim of exemption shall be made no later than the time of application for a building permit or permit for mobile home installation. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
B.  Credits. 
(1)  No credit shall be given for site-related improvements or site-related dedications, except as provided for in this article or in the impact fee report. 
(2)  Public safety facilities capital improvements may be offered by the fee payer as total or partial payment of the required fee. The offer shall specifically request or provide for a public safety impact fee credit. If the city manager accepts such an offer, whether the acceptance is before or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the credit shall be determined and provided for in the following manner: 
(a)  Credit for the dedication of non-site-related public safety lands shall be valued at (i) 115 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser, or (ii) the purchase price of said land as reflected in the closing documents of the most recent transfer, or (iii) at the option of the fee payer, by fair market value established by private appraisers acceptable to the city. Credit for the dedication of public safety land shall be provided when the property has been conveyed at no charge to, and accepted by, the city in a manner satisfactory to the city council. 
(b)  Applicants for credit for construction of non-site-related improvements shall submit acceptable engineering drawings and specifications, and construction cost estimates to the city manager. The city manager shall determine credit for public safety capital improvement facilities based upon either these cost estimates or upon alternative engineering criteria and construction cost estimates if the city manager determines that such estimates submitted by the applicant are either unreliable or inaccurate. The city manager shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant shall sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate and return such signed document to the city manager before credit shall be given. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 days shall nullify the credit. 
(c)  Except as provided in subparagraph (d), credit for construction of non-site-related improvements against impact fees otherwise due shall not be provided until: 
(1)  The construction is completed and accepted by the city, or other jurisdiction as provided by interlocal agreement having been executed pursuant to section 18.8(B), and section 18.10(A); 
(2)  A suitable maintenance and warranty bond is received and approved by the city attorney and the city engineer, when the project is under the jurisdiction of the city; or a letter from the applicable jurisdiction stating the construction has meet all warranty requirements of said jurisdiction; and 
(3)  All design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding and acceptance procedures are in strict compliance with the then current city engineering requirements, when applicable. 
(d)  Credit may be provided before completion of specified public safety improvements if adequate assurances are given by the applicant that the standards set out in subparagraph (c) shall be met and if the fee payer posts security as provided below for the costs of such construction. Security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement shall be posted with and approved by the city attorney in an amount determined by the city manager consistent with then current city Land Development Code. If the public safety facility or improvement construction project will not be constructed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the city manager, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten percent compounded for each year of the life of the security. The security shall be reviewed and approved, as to form, by the city attorney prior to acceptance of the security by the city manager. If the public safety facility or improvement project is not to be completed within two years of the date of the fee payer's offer, the city council shall approve the project and its scheduled completion date prior to the acceptance of the offer by the city manager. 
(3)  Any claim for credit shall be made no later than the time of application for a building permit or permit for mobile home installation. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
(4)  Credits shall not be transferable from one project or development to another without the approval of the city council. Credits may only be transferred to a development in a different impact fee district authorized by section 18.8(B), above, or to another local government jurisdiction that has a formal interlocal agreement with the city as specified in section 18.10(B), above, upon a finding by the city council that the dedication of public safety facility or improvement for which the credit was given, benefits such different impact fee district. 
(5)  In the event fee schedules are subsequently changed to reflect increases or decreases in construction costs or other relevant factors, then a fee payer may request a recalculation of credits to fairly reflect such changed circumstances. 
(6)  Determinations made by the city manager pursuant to the credit provisions of this section may be appealed to the city council by filing a written request with the city manager within ten days of the city manager's determination, as shall be communicated by the city manager in writing to the fee payer and such written determination shall give notice of this appeal provision. 
18.13. - Review. 
    The fees referenced in section 18.6(A) shall be reviewed by the city council at least once each fiscal year at the time of the city's comprehensive plan capital improvement element amendment review. 
18.14. - Administrative procedures. 
    The city manager is authorized, and he is directed, to prepare reasonable administrative regulations and policies in regard to the implementation of this article, as orderly administration shall require, and the same shall be approved and adopted by resolution of the city council, from time to time. 
18.15. - Penalty provisions. 
    A violation of this article shall be prosecuted in the same manner as misdemeanors are prosecuted and upon conviction the violator shall be punishable according to law; however, compliance herewith may be enforced by the city code enforcement board as provided by law.
