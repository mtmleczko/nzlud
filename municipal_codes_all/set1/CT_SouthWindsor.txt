PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of South Windsor, Connecticut. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Liana T. Kuras, former Town Clerk, and Mr. Barry D. Guliano, Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the Town, as set out in that certain pamphlet entitled "Town of South Windsor, Charter Book of Ordinances, Revised October 1, 1978." Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. The style of representation of names is as it appeared in the 1978 Charter Book.

Every ordinance, after passage, shall be given a code number and be recorded by the Town Clerk in a book to be kept for that purpose, which shall be properly indexed. Within ten days after passage, all ordinances shall be published once in a daily newspaper having a general circulation within the Town. An ordinance need not be published in full but, in lieu thereof, may be identified by title and described by subject matter. Every ordinance, unless it shall specify a later date, shall become effective on the tenth day after such publication following its final passage, provided that an ordinance stated to be a public emergency measure and stating the facts constituting such public emergency shall become effective immediately after such publication and that no public hearing or notice of public hearing shall be required for any public emergency measure.

It shall be the duty of the Clerk of the council immediately upon introduction of such written ordinances to prepare at least fifteen copies of each such proposed ordinance, one copy of which shall be retained in the Town Clerk's office for public inspection, and one copy to be posted in a public place in the Town office building. For the convenience of the public, copies shall be placed in each of the Town's public libraries. 
Section 308. - Emergency ordinances. 
    An emergency ordinance shall be only for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, shall contain an explicit statement of the nature of the emergency and shall be adopted by not less than six affirmative votes of the Council. 
Section 309. - Investigation. 
    The council shall have the power to investigate any and all departments, offices and agencies of the Town and for such purposes shall have the power to issue subpoenas. At the request of the council, any judge of the Superior Court may issue a capias for the appearance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. 
Section 310. - Relations to administrative service. 
    The council and its members shall deal with the administrative service solely through the Manager, and neither the council nor any member thereof shall give orders to any of the subordinates of the Manager, either publicly or privately, provided that a properly constituted meeting of the council, which the Manager has been invited to attend, may call before it any employee or officer for the purpose of investigation. 
Section 311. - Annual audit. 
    The council shall appoint an independent certified public accountant or firm of independent certified public accountants to audit the books and accounts of the Town as provided in the general statutes of the State of Connecticut. Such appointment shall be for a two-year term and shall be made in December of the odd-numbered years. 
State Law reference- Annual audit, C.G.S. § 7-391 et seq. 
Section 312. - Power of initiative. 
    The electors shall have the power by petition as hereinafter set forth to propose to the council any ordinance or other measure, except an ordinance or resolution appointing or removing officials, specifying the compensation of hours of work of officials and employees, appropriating money, authorizing the levy of taxes or fixing the tax rate. If the council fails to adopt such ordinance or other measure within thirty days after a petition making such a proposal shall have been filed with the council, the electors may adopt or reject the same at an election held within ninety days after such proposed ordinance or measure was originally filed with the council, provided that such petition shall have been signed in ink or indelible pencil by qualified electors of the Town equal in number to at least ten percent of the registered voters at the last municipal election. Said petition shall be accompanied by affidavits signed and sworn to by each circulator of such petition, certifying to the authenticity of the signatures on such petition. The Town Clerk shall determine the sufficiency of the petition and the affidavits. Unless at least twenty percent of the electors entitled to vote on the question shall have voted, such proposed ordinance or measure shall not become effective and the result shall be construed as against adoption.

(b)  The town of South Windsor may apply any charges, assessments or other payments assessed pursuant to section 1 [subsection (a)] of this act or C.G.S. § 7-249 against land or owners of land benefiting from the existing sewerage system to assure that such land or owners thereof shall bear a fair proportionate share of the cost of the sewerage system. 
(c)  Wherever a sewer is laid out through or adjacent to undeveloped lands or in a highway abutting such lands, and assessments are made with respect thereto by the town of South Windsor, and whenever the South Windsor sewer commission determines that at the time of completion of such sewer there would not be immediate benefits accruing to such lands and that such benefits will not accrue until there is a major change in conditions, of accessibility, in zoning restrictions, in use or in other conditions, said commission may defer collections and assessments of benefits subject to any equitable interest rates thereon which commission may assess, for such time as the rate of growth and development of the area warrants. 
(d)  If the sewer authority of the town of South Windsor provides for the payment of any assessment made pursuant to this act or C.G.S. § 7-249 in substantially equal annual installments, such installments of any assessment may be due at a time determined by said town notwithstanding the provisions of C.G.S. § 7-253 to the contrary.

Each addition of interest shall be collectible as a part of such assessment. Any such unpaid assessment shall constitute a lien upon the real estate against which such assessment was levied from the date it became delinquent. Each such lien may be continued, released and recorded in the manner provided by the general statutes for continuing, recording and releasing property tax liens. Each such lien shall take precedence over all other liens and encumbrances except taxes and may be foreclosed in the same manner as a lien for property taxes. Said town may designate the tax collector or any other person as collector of such assessments and such collector may collect such assessment in accordance with the provisions of the general statutes for the collection of property taxes. The town may recover any such charges in a civil action against any person liable therefor.

Sec. 2-4. - Tax stabilization fund program. 
(a)  Title. This section shall be known and may be cited as the Town of South Windsor Tax Stabilization Fund (TSF) program. 
(b)  Purpose of fund. The town's general tax revenues are sensitive to economic conditions as well as actions taken by state and federal government. Unanticipated revenue shortfalls during a fiscal year are usually addressed through reductions to services or increased taxes. The TSF program is established for sound financial management and fiscal accountability and enforces spending discipline by setting aside monies collected from revenues received during good economic conditions for use during years with lower growth or declining revenue. The TSF program may also reduce town borrowing costs due to stronger bond ratings. The purpose of the tax stabilization fund is to set aside revenue during years of strong growth in a fund which does not lapse at the end of the municipal fiscal year, which monies would then be available when revenue is stagnant or in decline and may be expended to prevent large tax increases and protect against the reduction of services in future years. 
(c)  Establishment of TSF. There is hereby established a fund pursuant to C.G.S. § 7-148(K), which fund shall not lapse at the end of the municipal fiscal year. Said fund shall be known as the South Windsor Tax Stabilization Fund (TSF). 
(d)  Fund balance. The town's annual budget shall include allocations to the TSF in amounts adequate to meet its purposes as follows: allocations into the fund will come from any surplus over $1,000,000.00 in the general fund annually. The town council may also appropriate up to ten percent of the amount of tax revenue generated in the first full year of new residential and/or commercial construction and/or revenue generated by the expiration of tax abatement and/or tax fixing agreements resulting in increased personal property and/or real property taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the aggregate balance in the TSF shall be a minimum of $500,000.00 but in no event shall it exceed a maximum of $3,000,000.00. 
(e)  Fund expenditures. The TSF shall not be reduced or used for purposes other than those specifically provided for in subsection (b) above, purpose of fund . During the development of the annual budget, the town council may authorize a transfer from the TSF to the general fund. This transfer will be shown as a revenue line in general fund budgeted revenue consistent to the extent possible with use of fund balance entries. The minimum annual transfer amount shall be $50,000.00 and the maximum annual transfer shall be $500,000.00 in any one fiscal year. 
(f)  Management of fund and termination. The TSF shall be administered by the town treasurer pursuant to Charter section 205. The TSF shall only be terminated by an affirmative vote of six members of the town council.

(2)  Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States indicate that:

d.  Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use and encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes and/or other members of the same sex, thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and urine to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms risking the health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with deposits; and 
e.  The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented establishments tend to discourage such sexual acts and prostitution, and thereby promotes the health, safety and welfare of the patrons, clients and customers of such establishments. 
(3)  Unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the town.

A certificate of appropriateness shall be required whether or not a building permit is required.

(Ord. No. 181, 3-3-08) 
Sec. 54-37. - Procedure. 
(a)  The historic district commission shall hold a public hearing upon each application for a certificate of appropriateness unless the commission determines that such application involves items not subject to approval by the commission. The commission shall fix a reasonable time and place for such hearing. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be given by publication in the form of a legal advertisement appearing in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the town not more than 15 days, nor less than five days before such hearing. 
(b)  Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, a majority of the members of the commission shall constitute a quorum and the concurring vote of a majority of the members of the commission shall be necessary to issue a certificate of appropriateness. Within not more than 65 days after the filing of an application as required by section 54-36, the commission shall pass upon such application and shall give written notice of its decision to the applicant. When a certificate of appropriateness is denied, the commission shall place upon its records and in the notice to the applicant the reasons for its determination, which shall include the basis for its conclusion that the proposed activity would not be appropriate. In the notice to the applicant, the commission may make recommendations relative to design, arrangement, texture, material and similar features. The commission may issue a certificate of appropriateness with stipulations. Evidence of approval, as referred to in section 54-36, shall be by certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Failure of the commission to act within said 65 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
(c)  If the commission determines that the proposed erection, alteration or parking will be appropriate, it shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. In passing on appropriateness as to exterior architectural features, buildings or structures, the commission shall consider, in addition to other pertinent factors, the type and style of exterior windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, aboveground utility structures, mechanical appurtenances and the type and texture of building materials. In passing upon appropriateness as to exterior architectural features, the commission shall also consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, scale, general design, arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other buildings and structures in the immediate neighborhood. No application for a certificate of appropriateness for an exterior architectural feature, such as a solar energy system, designed for the utilization of renewable resources shall be denied unless the commission finds that the feature cannot be installed without substantially impairing the historic character and appearance of the district. A certificate of appropriateness for such a feature may include stipulations requiring design modifications and limitations on the location of the feature which do not significantly impair effectiveness. In passing upon appropriateness as to parking, the commission shall take into consideration the size of such parking area, the visibility of cars parked therein, the closeness of such area to adjacent buildings and other similar factors. 
(d)  In its deliberations, the commission shall act only for the purpose of controlling the erection or alteration of buildings, structure or parking which are incongruous with the historic or architectural aspects of the district. The commission shall not consider any interior arrangement or use. However, the commission may recommend adaptive reuse of any buildings or structures within the district compatible with the historic architectural aspects of the district.

The presence of the wetlands agent shall be required at the hearing if requested by the person who was issued the citation. A person wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence in his or her behalf. The wetlands agent may present evidence on behalf of the municipality. If the person who received the citation fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him or her upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable provisions of the inland wetlands and watercourses regulations. The hearing officer may accept written information by mail from the person who received the citation and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he or she deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his or her decision at the end of the hearing. If the hearing officer determines that the person who received the citation is not liable, the hearing officer shall dismiss the matter and enter that determination in writing accordingly. If the hearing officer determines that the person who received the citation is liable for the violation, the hearing officer shall forthwith enter and assess the fines against such person as provided by this division, including an additional hearing fee.

(Ord. No. 168, § 9, 3-3-03)

Sec. 98-251. - Route 5 and Sullivan Avenue. 
    Whenever a property owner makes or permits a connection to be made with the following described water main, for the purpose of supplying his property with water, a lien for the following described connection charge in favor of the town shall be immediately attached to all the real property of such owner forming part of or contiguous to the real property so supplied with water. The water main referred to in this section is the one installed on Route No. 5 from the northerly terminus of the Metropolitan District pipeline to the East Windsor town line and the water main installed on Sullivan Avenue from Route No. 5 to the intersection of Ayers Road and that water main installed on Ayers Road from the intersection of Ayers Road proceeding easterly for a distance of 200 feet. The connection charge referred to in this section shall become payable at once to the tax collector of the town and shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum until paid and shall be in addition to any service charge payable to the Connecticut Water Company for such connection. Such charge shall be determined by multiplying $4.44 by 150, and the amount thus computed shall be considered as applying to the maximum frontage to be supplied by one service pipe; except that in case the frontage of the property desiring water service is less than 150 feet or is located in an area zoned or designated commercial or industrial and the actual frontage is on record in the land records of the town, the connection charge shall be $4.44 for each foot of frontage of record. In no event shall the lien or connection charge be less than $444.00.

(continued)
CCOZ South Windsor Center Core
CNOZ South Windsor Center North
R5NOZ Route 5 North Overlay Zone
Section 1.2 Maps
The boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on a map entitled Zoning Map of the
Town of South Windsor, dated April 28, 1969 and any revisions thereof, on file in the Office of the Town
Clerk, which map with all explanatory matter therein is hereby declared to be part of these regulations.
Section 1.3 Zoning District Boundaries
Unless otherwise indicated in figures on the zoning map, zoning district boundaries shall be construed as
follows:
1. They shall follow property lines, center line of a street, highway, railroad, brook or stream.
2. The water surface and land there under in any lake, pond or stream shall be subject to the
regulations of the applicable zone district in which they are located as far as the ownership
thereof extends under other provisions of the law.
3. Where the boundary line cannot be determined as aforesaid, then the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall decide where the boundary line shall be.
4. The limits of the Flood Plain District shall be conterminous with that of the 100-year base flood,
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (Zones A, A1-A30), effective September 26, 2008,,
as prepared and amended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FE- MA). Said rate
map is a component of the Flood Insurance Study, dated September 26, 2008. Said Flood Plain
District shall be superimposed over any other district shown on the zoning map and shall apply.
ARTICLE 2  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Page 2-1
ARTICLE 2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Section 2.1 Compliance with Provisions of the Regulations
No building, structure or premises shall be used or occupied, and no building or part thereof or other
structure shall be erected, raised, moved, placed, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, or altered except in
conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district as shown on the official map in which it is
located.
No building, structure, or premises shall be erected, altered, or used so as to produce greater heights, smaller
yards, or less unoccupied area, and no building shall be occupied by more families than pre- scribed for
such building, structure or premises for the district in which it is located.
Section 2.2 Lot Configuration
All new lots shall be designed with a simple, practical configuration. Awkward lot configurations designed
for the purpose of creating additional lots shall be avoided. A rear portion of a lot connected to the
frontage portion of the lot by a narrow, unusable strip of property (see illustration of example, below) is
not allowed. In determining whether a lot meets the requirements of this section, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider the following:
1. Is the front portion of the lot useable for primary or accessory uses as permitted in the zone;
2. Are there distinguishable setbacks (i.e., do front, side and/or rear setbacks overlap);
3. Is there a useable building area in the front portion of the lot, or is the whole front portion
occupied by setback areas;
4. At a minimum, does the interconnection between lot areas provide a bona fide access between
the separate areas;
5. Could the lot boundaries be physically separated (e.g., with a fence) from abutting properties and
still result in bona fide access between separate areas of the lot.
If the answer to three or more of these criteria is no, then the proposed lot shall either be reconfigured to
meet the criteria or eliminated. Front portion of lot

Section 2.3 Lots in More than One District
In the case of a lot lying in more than one district, the provision of the less restrictive district may be
applied for a distance of not over 25 feet into the more restrictive district, provided that such lot has frontage
on a street in the less restrictive district.
Section 2.4 Use of Land for Access and Parking
The use of residentially zoned land for access to or for parking in connection with an adjacent commercial
or industrial use is not permitted.
Section 2.5 Building on Existing Nonconforming Lots
Provided that safe and adequate disposal of sewage and a safe water supply can be provided without
endangering the health and safety of adjoining residents, nothing in these regulations or in any pertinent
amendments hereto, shall prevent the construction of a building or the establishment of a use permitted
hereunder or under any pertinent amendment hereto on a lot containing less than the prescribed area, or less
than the prescribed width or depth of front yard, if immediately prior to the adoption hereof or of any
pertinent amendment hereto, such building or use was permitted on said lot and said lot was then and has
continued to be owned separately from any adjoining lot. Side yards, rear yards, and all other requirements
of Section 3.1.2 Residential Area, Density and Dimensional Requirements and 4.1.6 Commercial and
Industrial Area, Density and Dimensional Requirements must be maintained.
Section 2.6 Projection into Yards
Nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the projection of 2 feet or less into a required yard of such
building features as pilasters, columns, belt courses, sills, windows, cornices, roof overhangs, chimneys, or
similar architectural features. Stoops (without a roof) may project no more than 6 feet into required yards.
Handicap ramps may extend into yard setbacks as needed. The Commission may grant a waiver to yard
setback requirements for art and decorative items such as fountains and statues.
Section 2.7 Lots on Narrow Streets
In the case of lots fronting on streets with a right-of-way less than 50 feet wide, the front yard setback
required by the applicable provisions of these regulations shall be increased by 1/2 the difference be- tween
50 feet and the actual width of the existing street right-of-way.
Section 2.8 Corner Visibility
On a corner lot in any district, no fence, wall, hedge or other structure or planting more than 3 feet in height
shall be erected, placed, or maintained within the triangular area formed by the intersecting pavement lines
and a straight line joining said pavement lines at points which are 50 feet distant from the point of
intersection, measured along said pavement lines.
Section 2.9 Accessory Buildings
A. Except as provided for buildings accessory to farming or agricultural use, detached accessory
buildings no more than 12 feet high may not be nearer to a rear lot line than the applicable side yard
distance in that zone.
ARTICLE 2  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Page 2-3
B. Accessory buildings shall occupy 20% or less of the required rear yard.
C. No accessory building shall be erected prior to the erection of the main building on a lot, except that
this shall not prohibit completion and occupancy of an accessory building before completion of the
main building under construction on the same lot.
D. A building attached to a main building by any structural members, except a fence or wall 6 feet or less
above the ground, shall be considered an integral part of the main building.

(1) Lots with frontage on Buckland Road or Sullivan Avenue have a minimum lot width of 150 feet. Where the
requirements of Table 3.1.2A are greater, the Table 3.1.2A requirements apply.
(2) Lots with frontage on Buckland Road or Sullivan Avenue have a minimum front yard setback of 50 feet. Where the
requirements of Table 3.1.2A are greater, the Table 3.1.2A requirements apply.
(3) Buffers are in addition to required side/rear yards.
(4) Lot area must be contiguous acres not divided by a public street. The entire site shall be located in the MF district. Land
contained within the Flood Plain District may not apply toward the minimum site size, however, may be dedicated for open
space uses subject to the requirements of the Flood Plain District.
(5) Where a buffer is required, the rear and side yards shall be a minimum of 25 feet.
(6) Pervious surface may be used to increase the coverage of the lot a maximum of 5% when a minimum of the pervious
coverage total is a minimum of 10%. See definitions.
B. Each approved residential lot shall contain a contiguous buildable area (buildable defined as
exclusive of regulated wetlands and watercourses, waterbodies, detention areas, utility easements,
rights-of-way, or areas with slopes at or in excess of 15%) of at least 10,000 square feet, into which a
square of 90 x 90 can be located, and on which the dwelling must be located. This restriction as to
building location applies only to those lots that contain wetlands and watercourses, waterbodies,
detention areas, utility easements, rights-of-way, or areas with slopes at or in excess of 15%.
C. Minimum yards shall be in addition to buffer widths, where such buffers are required by the Commission.
D. The building height limit shall be applied separately for each wing or any other distinct portion of the
building and may be increased for any building or distinct portion thereof by 1 foot for every 2 feet by
which such building or such portion thereof lies inside the nearest limiting line of any required front,
side or rear yard. Spires, cupolas, towers, chimneys, flagpoles, penthouses, ventilators,
ARTICLE 3  RESIDENTIAL ZONES
Page 3-6
tanks, and similar features which are an integral part of the main structure occupying in the aggregate
not more than 10% of the building area and not used for human occupancy, may be erected to a
reasonable and necessary height.
E. For municipal facilities and uses, height restrictions of Table 3.1.2A may be waived by the
Commission when appropriate so that public utility buildings/structures may be erected to a reasonable
and necessary height.
F. Each lot in future subdivisions of land shall have the frontage required in the applicable zone upon a
public street, or upon a proposed public street, shown on a map that has been approved by the South
Windsor Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations of the
Town.
G. In the case of inground swimming pools and above ground swimming pools, the minimum rear yard
requirement shall be 25 feet and shall apply to any decking or equipment associated with the pool.
H. The front yard setback may be reduced by not more than ten (10) feet strictly for the purpose of
constructing a covered, unenclosed front porch as defined in these regulations. The intention of the
un- enclosed front porch setback reduction is to allow the construction of a typical unenclosed
front porch (see illustration). In order to be eligible for any portion of the 10-foot reduced setback,
an un- enclosed front porch must meet the following requirements:
1. The porch design and materials must be architecturally compatible with the house.
2. Maximum porch width (perpendicular to house): 10 feet.
3. Minimum porch length (parallel to house): 50% of the length of
the house.

5. Maximum height of railings or other enclosures: 36 inches,
measured from the finished elevation of porch floor.
6. Maximum enclosure: 30% (above finished elevation of porch
floor). Plastic sheeting; window screening; curtains and window
shades of any type; or any other type of covering, whether
permanent or temporary, fixed or loose, is considered an
enclosure.
7. This section is applicable to all zones except MF-AA and MF-A.

less than 21 years of age.
(2)Within the MF-AA zone, each dwelling unit shall have a garage for the storage of 1 or more
automobiles. In lieu of said garage, a carport or other roofed structure providing covered storage for 1 or
more automobiles may be allowed if the location and design is specifically approved by the Commission.
Such garage (or other approved structure) may be attached or semi-attached to the dwelling unit (or to the
building containing the dwelling unit), or may be detached from the dwelling unit (or from the building
containing the dwelling unit). However, each garage (or other approved structure), shall be located in close
proximity to the dwelling unit being served by that garage (or other approved structure).
If the garage (or other approved structure) is unenclosed or unlockable, then in addition to the garage (or
other approved structure), each dwelling unit shall be provided with a storage space accessible as described
in note (3) below.

space, accessible either at grade or via gently sloping ramps. All such exterior storage shall:
Be lockable;
Have a minimum inside height of 6'8? and a minimum width of 4'; and
Be dry, free of water infiltration, and constructed to prevent such infiltration.
Such storage may be attached or semi-attached to the dwelling unit, located in a basement, or located in a
detached building or storage shed. However, the storage shall be located in close proximity to the
dwelling unit being served by that storage space. Said exterior storage may be in the form of a garage for
the storage of 1 or more automobiles.

I. Living areas may include customary rooms, halls, and closets, but shall not include stairways and
public halls, rooms for heating equipment, garages, open or closed outside vestibules or porches or
verandas or breezeways. Basement space will not qualify for required living quarters. Floor areas for
living quarters shall be computed by using the interior dimensions of the interior walls. These areas
do not include circulation and public facilities outside the unit, spaces for heating equipment, or areas
within a basement, cellar, or habitable attic.
J. Habitable attics are permitted. However, no floor area of such habitable attic shall apply toward the
minimum living area requirement of these regulations. No improved basement floor area shall apply
toward the minimum living area requirement of these regulations.
Section 3.2 Residential Zones (RR, AA and A)
3.2.1 Accessory Buildings and Uses
Accessory buildings and uses customarily used with and incidental to a permitted use, including
buildings used for permitted home occupations, are permitted.
A. Private Garages
1. Accessory buildings may include private garages with space for:
a. Not more than 2 non-commercial motor vehicles and 1 commercial motor vehicle (in
conformance with paragraph 3.2.1.B) on 1 lot. and
b. One additional non-commercial vehicle for each 10,000 square feet by which the area of the
lot exceeds 1 acre.
B. Commercial Vehicles
Not more than 1 commercial vehicle, other than passenger vehicles, may be parked on a residential lot,
provided such vehicle is a van type vehicle or a pick-up truck type vehicle.
C. Agricultural Product Manufacture
Buildings used for the storing, processing and manufacture of agricultural products are permitted as an
accessory use on a farm.
D. Temporary Roadside Stands
1. Roadside stands of a temporary and removable nature on a farm for the sale and display of crops
grown on the premises shall be allowed, provided that such stand is removed after no more than
120 days of use in each calendar year.
2. Roadside stands of a temporary and removable nature other than on a farm, for the display and sale
of farm produce grown in South Windsor shall be allowed provided the following conditions are
met:
a. These roadside stands shall be allowed only during the growing season, and for not more
than 120 days of use in each calendar year.
b. They shall be located not less than 20 feet from a street line and not less than 50 feet from

ARTICLE 3  RESIDENTIAL ZONES
Page 3-9
3. An applicant shall apply to the Zoning Enforcement Officer for a Zoning Permit for uses
permissible under this section.
E. Slaughtering of Livestock
The slaughtering of livestock and poultry raised on a farm, and as an accessory use to such farm, is permitted,
but the slaughtering of other livestock and poultry is prohibited.
F. Farm Equipment Storage
Buildings used for the storage on a farm of any number of motor vehicles and equipment, when such
vehicles and equipment are used in connection with the operation of such farm, are permitted as an
accessory use. The repair of such vehicles only is permitted within a building on the farm upon which such
vehicles are so used.
G. Animal Housing
Accessory buildings on a farm housing animals and poultry, other than horses and ponies, or buildings used
in conjunction with paragraphs D and E above are permitted not less than 100 feet from a street or lot line,
and not less than 150 feet from the nearest existing residential building on land under separate ownership.
3.2.2 Interior Lots
A. Purpose
It is the purpose of this section to recognize that there are land configurations in which it is impractical to
construct a new residential street. This section allows the approval, as Special Exception after a public
hearing, of the development of an interior lot that does not meet lot frontage requirements of the zoning
district in which it is located. This section is not intended to encourage the development of land
characterized by severe physical limitations
B. Applicability
1. This section does not apply to development of new subdivision lots on new streets. Such lots must
meet the required width upon the street as defined in Article 10: Definitions (Lot Frontage). This
section is intended to allow for the division of existing properties into not more than 2 new lots, 1
or both of which cannot meet lot frontage requirements for the zone.
2. Properties upon which interior lots are proposed must have been in existence as recorded by deed
in the South Windsor land records, prior to adoption of this regulation on June 11, 1990. This
regulation is not intended to allow for the creation of remainder parcels of land (upon which
interior lots are subsequently requested) without adequate frontage when new subdivisions are
approved.
3. Not more than 2 interior lots shall be approved on an existing parcel regardless of the number of
frontage access areas. An existing parcel that has been divided into 2 interior lots under this
regulation shall not be re-divided into further interior lots under this regulation at any time.
4. Interior lot development shall be limited to single-family dwellings and permitted accessory
structures.
5. Interior lots will be allowed only in the following zones: RR, A-20, A-30, A-40, and AA-30. Any
existing conforming frontage lot must continue to meet the current zoning requirements.
ARTICLE 3  RESIDENTIAL ZONES
Page 3-10
C. Approval Criteria
In reviewing and acting upon any proposal for an interior lot, the Commission shall determine that the
following criteria are met.
1. The proposed interior lot(s) shall be deemed to accomplish the best use of the subject land and shall
be justified by the subject areas boundary configurations, topography, soils or other natural
resource characteristics. In reviewing a proposed interior lot, the Commission shall carefully
evaluate aesthetics; proximity to neighboring properties and dwelling units; restriction of existing
views; proposed buffering/screening; potential drainage, traffic and environmental impacts;
driveway locations, slopes and sight lines; utility service capabilities; property value impacts; and
future land use alternatives. The applicant must demonstrate to the Commission that there are
minimal impacts for all of the above-listed criteria.
2. Except for requirements modified by this interior lot section, all new interior lot development shall
conform to all requirements prescribed for the zone in which the interior lot is located.
3. All interior lots shall have a minimum area which is double the required area for the zoning
district in which the interior lot is established with the exception of A-20 zones, which shall have a
minimum lot area that is triple the minimum required lot area. Minimum lot area shall be
calculated exclusive of access area. Where lot approval is requested in an open-space subdivision,
minimum area is still twice the standard lot size for the district.
4. The access area is defined as the area in front of the minimum lot width line. The minimum lot
width line is defined as the line perpendicular to the mean direction of the lot side lines, at which
the required minimum width is obtained. The minimum lot width shall generally be parallel to the
town street from which access is obtained. All interior lots must have a width at the minimum lot
width line equal to l.5 times the required lot width for the zoning district in which it is located.
5. All proposed interior lots shall include an access way meeting the following standards:
a. The access way portion of the interior lot shall directly front on a public street and be owned
in fee by the interior lot. Alternatively, an access easement can be granted for the interior lot
over the existing frontage provided that frontage is in excess of the minimum frontage
requirements of the underlying zone by a minimum of 25 feet;
b. The access way shall have suitable sight lines along the street it fronts upon;
c. No access way shall be located adjacent to another access way to an interior lot. There must be
a separating distance between access ways equal to the minimum lot width in the zone in which
the interior lots are located.
6. Driveways to interior lots shall be designed and constructed to accommodate fire apparatus and
other emergency equipment. All application for interior lots shall detail the nature of proposed
driveway construction including proposed location, width and building materials, and provision for
vehicles to turn around. Driveway plans must be reviewed and approved by the Town Engineer and
the Fire Marshal.
7. Not more than 2 interior lots may be accessed by a single access way. Access rights must be
documented for both lots.
8. There are no established front yard setbacks. An application will be evaluated for its aesthetic
impact on neighboring properties, especially front/existing lots. Suggested guideline for house
placement is that the proposed front yard setback be equivalent to neighboring properties
ARTICLE 3  RESIDENTIAL ZONES
Page 3-11
interior yards. Setback lines shall be proposed by the applicant with the application and
approved or modified by the Commission.
9. The side and rear yard setbacks required for the zoning district in which the lot is located must be
observed.
10. The Commission can require greater setbacks from any property line where land configuration,
topography, other physical limitations or existing development on adjacent land dictate that increased
setbacks are desirable.
11. Unless the interior lots front on different streets, no interior lot shall be permitted to the rear of any
other interior lot. (Stacking is not permitted.)
D. Application for Approval
1. Application for Special Exception approval shall include all items required for a standard
subdivision of land per Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations if the creation of an
interior lot requires a subdivision of land. In addition, location of the proposed house and driveway
access, with proposed grading, must be shown.
2. If the creation of the interior lot does not require a subdivision of land, the application shall
include a plot plan/topographic map of the existing and proposed lot(s) at a scale of 1? = 20' or
1?
= 40' on 18? x 24? or 24? x 36? sheets containing the following information:
a. Distance and bearings of all boundary lines;
b. Lot layout numbers, square footage of all lots, and all lot dimensions;
c. Building lines, in accordance with zoning regulations and the provisions of this regulation;
d. Easements, noting grantors, grantees, and purpose;
e. Names of abutting property owners;
f. All existing buildings;
g. Existing and proposed sanitary and storm sewers, if any;
h. Present wooded areas indicated by a foliage line;
i. Existing and proposed contours shown at not less than 2 foot intervals; but in cases of
relatively level land, the contours shall be 1 foot intervals;
j. Boundaries of regulated wetlands; and
k. Proposed house(s) and driveway access with proposed grading.
3. The plans/maps shall conform to Class A-2 and T-2 requirements.

inherent conflicts between outbound left and inbound left maneuvers, applicants must demonstrate to the
Commissions satisfaction that the site generated traffic is able to enter and exit the site safely without
disruption to the external traffic flow. On-site queuing provisions must be adequate to prevent site
generated traffic from queuing on public streets. Sight lines for the existing traffic from the site drive must
be satisfactory for the prevailing speed of approaching traffic. The applicant must demonstrate that the design
provides for safe and orderly vehicular and pedestrian flow and movement of traffic and minimizes
vehicular and pedestrian conflicts. Delivery areas must be located so that normal operations are not
impeded or compromised. An engineered traffic report must be provided with the application to demonstrate
the adequacy of traffic flow and design.

B. The building height limit shall be applied separately for each wing or any other distinct portion of the
building and may be increased for any building or distinct portion thereof by 1 foot for every 2 feet by
which such building or such portion thereof lies inside the nearest limiting line of any required front,
side or rear yard. Spires, cupolas, towers, chimneys, flagpoles, penthouses, ventilators, HVAC
equipment, rooftop units, tanks, and similar features which are an integral part of the main structure
occupying in the aggregate not more than 10% of the building area and not used for human
occupancy, may be erected to a reasonable and necessary height.
4.1.7 Design Requirements - RC Zone
A. Design Requirements
1. Sites and landscaping shall be designed in accordance with the criteria and standards contained in
Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review. Existing trees and hedgerows shall be incorporated
into site design and preserved to the maximum extent possible. All building elevations that are
visible from a public street must be attractively designed, with windows and/or other architectural
elements and features such that no visible elevation looks like the back of a building.
2. All buildings must conform to the provisions of Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review.
Applicants must avoid submitting stereotypical franchise type buildings unless the building truly
demonstrates architectural excellence.
B. Access
The Commission may require or limit the number of access/egress drives and/or direct the placement of
same within a Consolidated Parcel such that only 1 or more of several individually or commonly owned
"sub-parcels" within the Consolidated Parcel would have a point of access/egress. Such restriction would
be in accordance with current access management policies and plans.
C. Yards
Side or rear yards may be ignored along common boundaries of consolidated lots.
D. Impervious Coverage Bonus
A 5% impervious coverage bonus may be granted for the consolidation of 2 or more lots that are
nonconforming to the minimum lot size requirement into 1 larger lot. When a non-conforming lot is
combined with a conforming lot, an additional 5% of the area of the non-conforming lot can be added to
the total impervious surface allowed.
4.1.8 Mixed Uses in Commercial/Office Zones
A. Purpose
The purpose of this regulation is to increase the supply of affordable rental dwelling units in South Windsor
by allowing construction of dwelling units in commercial buildings in certain commercial/office zones as
a Special Exception use.
B. Applicable Zones
Mixed uses are permitted by Special Exception in Restricted Commercial, General Commercial,
Restricted Office, and Office Conversion Overlay zones only.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-9
C. Design Criteria
1. Dwelling units must be located above commercial use; first floor commercial uses may not be
converted to residential use.
2. Only one level of dwelling units is allowed. Units may be townhouse-style with more than one
floor where height restrictions allow, but no unit may be located above another dwelling unit.
3. A separate entrance is required for dwelling units; main entrance(s) for residents cannot be
located in close proximity to commercial loading/service areas.
4. Two parking spaces per unit are required. Applicant may request a waiver, which may be granted
by the Commission after applicant has demonstrated that shared parking with commercial uses will
be adequate.
5. Storage space of 60 square feet per dwelling unit must be provided in addition to normal living
quarters storage space. Storage space may be outside of dwelling unit but must be indoors,
readily accessible to residents, and each units storage space must be separately lockable.
6. Pedestrian circulation must be attractively designed to encourage use by residents. Appropriate
street furniture, e.g., benches, planters, should be provided. The pedestrian areas may include
gardens/plantings, brick or other attractive paving materials, etc.
7. Adequate lighting of both pedestrian and parking areas must be provided.
8. Sound insulation must be provided between commercial and residential levels.
9. Maximum number of units allowed per site is 25; there is no minimum.
10. A mix of unit sizes must be provided. No 3-bedroom units are allowed.
11. Where dumpsters are proposed, dumpster locations shall be shown on the site plan. All dumpsters
shall be placed on a concrete pad and suitably screened with trees, shrubs, fencing, or by other
appropriate means (e.g., the building itself). Solid waste removal services shall be provided by the
owners of the development.
12. All building code and fire safety requirements must be met.
13. Domestic hot water, heating, and cooling systems shall be separate for each dwelling unit.
D. Special Exception Criteria
The Commission shall approve a Special Exception for mixed residential/commercial use only if it finds
that, in addition to the Design Criteria (paragraph 4.1.8.C above) and the review criteria of Section 8.4
Special Exception Standards and Procedures, the following criteria are satisfactorily met:
1. There is a balance between neighborhood acceptance and community needs.
2. The existing/proposed commercial/office uses are compatible with residential uses.
3. The internal traffic circulation pattern is designed to minimize safety hazards for residents,
particularly with respect to access into and out of the building.
4. Site design adequately reflects that residents needs are accommodated as an integral part of the
site design (e.g., recreation, parking, storage, access) such that the site functions as an integrated
site.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-10
5. The proposed mixed use furthers the purpose stated in paragraph 4.1.8.A.
6. There is no undue concentration of high-density residential development in any
area/neighborhood.
The Commission shall grant all approvals subject to such conditions and safeguards as will carry out the
expressed purpose of these regulations.
All requirements of the underlying zone that are not expressly altered by the above requirements must be
met.
Section 4.2 Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone (GD)
4.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone is to create an attractive entrance to South
Windsor. This zone should foster high-quality development of businesses and sites, with careful attention
to the appearance of buildings and surrounding site, integration of historic structures where possible, and
professional landscaping. Within the Zone, it is beneficial to the economic viability of the Zone and the
overall high-quality of the area to introduce a multifamily residential component at certain, but not all,
locations to create a fully-integrated mixed-use land use pattern to accomplish the purpose of the Zone.
Access management will be an integral part of site planning, with interior service drives and limited curb
cuts to facilitate traffic flow and safety. In recognition of the fact that it is generally site appearance and
performance that determine whether a use is desirable or undesirable, and that there will be desirable uses
that have not been developed yet, permitted uses will be those that are able to meet all of the standards
enumerated below and in other applicable sections of these regulations.
4.2.2 Definitions
Development Area Plan: Is defined as the site area within boundaries shown on the submitted General
Plan of Development or Final Plan that illustrates the proposed development and its physical impacts on
surrounding area, facilities and systems in accordance with the regulations. The intent of this is to
illustrate the contiguous area for the purposes of creating a new mixed use development.
Drive-Through Facility: An establishment that by design encourages or permits customers to receive
services or obtain goods while remaining in their motor vehicles.
Human Scaled: Site and building design elements that are dimensionally related to pedestrians, such as:
small building spaces with individual entrances (e.g., as is typical of downtowns and main street
developments); larger buildings which have articulation and detailing to break up large masses; narrower
streets with tree canopies; smaller parking areas or parking areas broken up into small components with
landscaping; and pedestrian amenities, such as sidewalks, plazas, outdoor seating, shorter light poles
(usually 10-14), weather protection (e.g., awnings or canopies), and similar features. These features are all
generally smaller in scale than those which are primarily intended to accommodate automobile traffic.
Pedestrian Amenities: Pedestrian amenities serve as informal gathering places for socializing, resting, and
enjoyment of a particular area and contribute to a walk-able center. Typical amenities include extra wide
sidewalks, street trees, sitting spaces, weather protection (awnings or canopies), pedestrian scale lighting,
bus stop seating, sidewalk dining, etc.
Pedestrian-Friendly/Pedestrian-Oriented: Development which is designed with an emphasis primarily
on the sidewalk and pedestrian access to and within the site and building, rather than on auto access and
parking areas. The building is generally placed close to the street and the main entrance is oriented to the
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-11
street sidewalk. There are generally windows or display cases along building façades which face the street.
Strip Commercial Center: Strip commercial centers are typically developed, owned and maintained as a
unit and have large parking lots in front, with many/most of the stores arranged in a straight row and an
automobile-centric design. Proliferation results in a pattern of development wherein commercial
development is strung along an arterial thoroughfare.
4.2.3 General Concepts
A. Site planning is an essential criterion of the Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone. Sites
developed under this zone are intended to be carefully planned, both within the sites own boundaries
and in relation to surrounding properties and the entire Buckland Road Gateway Development zone. It
is the express intention of these Buckland Road Gateway Development zone regulations to result in
developments that do not resemble typical strip commercial centers. All developments shall be
human scaled, pedestrian friendly/pedestrian oriented developments with pedestrian amenities.
B. Retail developments depend on high visibility from major public streets. In turn, their design determines
much of the character and attractiveness of major streetscapes. The marketing interests of many
corporations, even with strong image-making design by professional designers, can be potentially
detrimental to community aspirations and sense of place when they result in developments that do not
contribute to or integrate with the Town in a positive way. In recognition of this, the Gateway zone
includes special standards and guidelines for retail developments. These standards and objectives
require a basic level of architectural variety, compatible scale, and mitigation of negative impacts. The
standards are by no means intended to limit creativity; it is the Towns hope that they will serve as a
useful tool for design professionals engaged in site-specific design. The purpose of these standards and
guidelines is to augment existing criteria with more specific interpretations that apply to the design of
retail store developments.
C. All buildings must be individually designed by registered architects for compatibility with South
Windsor and must conform to the provisions of Section 8.7, Architectural and Design Review. The type
of design excellence described in Section 8.7 is usually not obtained with stereotypical franchise-type
building designs. Applicants must avoid submitting stereotypical franchise-type buildings unless the
building truly demonstrates architectural excellence.
D. This zone is intended to encourage smaller sites to combine with other sites in order to provide
larger-scale sites and developments. As an incentive to promote combining of properties, a 5%
impervious coverage bonus will be granted for nonconforming lot consolidation per paragraph 4.1.7.D.
E. Access management will be required on all sites in order to reduce the number of driveway cuts onto
Buckland Road and mitigate the deterioration of traffic flow generally caused by driveways on arterial
streets. Access management techniques will include shared driveways (or provisions for future
shared driveways for the first site in an area), interior service drives, and other techniques included in
South Windsors access management program.
F. On sites where stormwater detention/retention will be accomplished via surface detention/retention
basins, provisions shall be made for shared detention/retention basins to the maximum extent feasible.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-12
4.2.4 Pre-Application Discussion
Applicants are encouraged to initiate a pre-application conference with the Commission to discuss the
conceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan for informal
consideration by the Commission. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review of the
concept plan, nor the Commissions suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any
portion of the application.
4.2.5 Permitted Uses
A. Permitted uses are those commercial, institutional, cultural and municipal uses that reflect the
purposes of these regulations by careful attention to the appearance and siting of their buildings and/or
site amenities, and that meet all of the performance standards enumerated within this section and all
other applicable sections of the these regulations, with the exception of the following specifically
prohibited uses in Section 4.2.6
B. Grocery stores shall be permitted so long as any grocery store proposed is at least 1500 feet from any
other existing grocery store. Specialty food stores (including, but not limited to, health foods, cheese
shops, etc.) of less than 10,000 square feet in size are not considered to be grocery stores and are
permitted regardless of their distance from any permitted grocery store or other specialty food store.
C. Multifamily Residential Use, subject to the requirements of this Section and the specific requirements
of Section 4.2.15.
D. Automotive fuel stations are permitted only when accessory to a retail sales and inventory use, where
the automotive fuel station use is directly related to such retail sales and inventory use which has a
minimum gross floor area of 100,000 square feet. Such facility must be a minimum of 500 feet from
Buckland Road and within 1,500 feet of the primary building. In addition to motor vehicle refueling,
such automotive fuel stations may also provide: (i) re-energizing services such as propane, electricity
or similar service, which may be dispensed directly to the vehicle from pumps, plugs, couplings or
some other approved means. The Commission may determine hours of operation. The automotive fuel
station shall be designed with the same criteria applicable to permitted uses as provided by Section
4.3.5 (A).
E. Drive-through facilities are a permitted use provided they comply with the design standards as set forth
in Section 4.2.16 and only when the use to which the drive-through facility is a part of meets the
following criteria:
a. Hot meals must be made to order.
b. Use must be part of a multi-tenant building.
c. Restaurant must offer table delivery of food.
d. Metal silverware, ceramic plates, and other dishwasher safe materials are required for patrons
use on premises. Food cannot be served on premises in/on Styrofoam or plastic.
e. The facility must be part of a planned unit development of at least two-hundred thousand
(200,000) square feet of gross building area.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-13

A. Gasoline service stations, except an automotive fuel station which is permitted as provided by Section
4.2.5.D; automotive, boat, recreational vehicle, truck, and similar sales, service and repair garages.
Public display of any vehicle for sale is strictly prohibited. Boat shall not include non-motorized boats
up to 16 feet in length (e.g. canoes, kayaks).
B. Establishments where the principal use is a drive-in offering goods/services directly to customers
waiting in motor vehicles;
C. Casinos, arcades (amusement centers with coin-operated or token-operated games or any type of
electronic payment for operation of games, or similar) as a principal use;
D. Adult-oriented businesses (including but not limited to adult bookstores, adult theaters, massage
parlors, and the like);
E. Mini-warehouses/self-storage facilities;
F. Nightclubs, taverns, social clubs, and similar uses where the primary purpose of the business is the
serving of alcoholic beverages;
G. Stand-alone fast food restaurants, more specifically, restaurants that do not meet the criteria as set
forth in Section 4.2.5.E. Fast food restaurants are allowed only as part of a larger complex such as a
food court in a shopping center.

L. Any use similar in purpose, use, or service to the above prohibited uses, regardless of its name or
title; and
M. On-site dry cleaning.
4.2.7 Consolidated Parcels
A. Purpose
In the interest of promoting development continuity, the consolidation of contiguous parcels is
encouraged. Consolidation is defined here as the integration of 2 or more individually owned parcels into
a single Consolidated Parcel for the purposes of creating a shared-use arrangement of selected site
components, e.g. common points of access/egress, drive passage, parking, loading/unloading, building
coverage and yards.
B. Procedure
1. A consolidated parcel shall be developed with an integrated plan of buildings, parking, loading
and unloading, and open space.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-14
2. The owner of each lot shall give to the owner of each lot in the consolidated parcel by deed,
easement, or agreement filed in the Office of the Town Clerk, the right of entrance, exit, passage,
parking, and loading.
C. Access
The Commission may require or limit the number of access/egress drives and/or direct the placement of
same within a Consolidated Parcel such that only 1 or more of several individually or commonly owned
"sub-parcels" within the Consolidated Parcel would have a point of access/egress. Such restriction would
be in accordance with current access management policies and plans.
D. Yards
Side or rear yards may be ignored along common boundaries of consolidated lots.
E. Impervious Coverage Bonus
A 5% impervious coverage bonus may be granted for the consolidation of 2 or more lots that are
non-conforming to the minimum lot size requirement into 1 larger lot. When a non-conforming lot is
combined with a conforming lot, an additional 5% of the area of the non-conforming lot can be added to
the total impervious surface allowed.
4.2.8 Yard and Bulk Requirements
A. Minimum lot size is 3 acres. Pre-existing legally created lots that do not meet the minimum 3 acre
requirement shall be considered legally nonconforming lots in accordance with Section 2.5 Building
on Existing Nonconforming Lots.
B. In order to ensure that there will be large open spaces between the front of buildings and public roads,
with minimal yard spaces at the rear of properties, the following setbacks shall apply:
1. Minimum lot frontage is 200 feet;
2. Minimum lot depth is 200 feet;
3. Minimum front yard setback is 65 feet;
4. Minimum side yard setback is 25 feet; and
5. Minimum rear yard setback is 10 feet.
C. Where the Gateway Development Zone abuts a residential zone, the minimum setback from the
property boundary shall be 65 feet. Front and side yard setbacks are exclusive of all structures (except
permitted signs).
D. The Commission may grant a waiver to the yard setback requirements for art/sculpture or other
decorative items such as fountains.
E. Maximum impervious coverage is 60%. The Commission may grant a 5% bonus for consolidated
parcels (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.1.8.D).
F. The maximum building height is 60 feet/4 stories for any building that is at least 125 feet from a
public street right-of-way, provided, however, that any portion of such building located within 125 feet
of the public street right-of-way or any building located in its entirety within 125 feet of the public
street right-of-way shall have a maximum height of 30 feet/2 stories.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-15
G. The applicant may request and the Commission may grant a height waiver to increase the building
height to 90 feet/6 stories for a building or portion thereof located at least 200 feet from any public
street and from any residential zone boundary, if the Commission determines that the site is suitable for
a taller building and that the character of the Gateway Development Zone is enhanced rather than
diminished by a taller building. In order to qualify for a height waiver, the applicant must demonstrate
that the taller building conforms with the following criteria:
1. Site location and topography are such that the taller building blends in with its surroundings
rather than standing out from the surroundings. These criteria will generally be met when the site
elevation is substantially lower than the adjacent public street(s), and the surrounding commercial
development is at a higher elevation than the adjacent public street(s).
2. The taller building does not unduly disrupt the character of a residentially-zoned neighborhood.
H. A 5% reduction in maximum impervious coverage is required for each additional floor above 4
stories. The resulting green areas are to be distributed around the taller building, not isolated in a portion
of the site with low visibility in relation to the subject building. This 5% reduction is applicable to the
impervious coverage assigned to the tall building based on the applicable formulas for the minimum
required lot size.
4.2.9 Site Appearance Requirements
A. Sites, buildings, signs, and landscaping shall be designed in accordance with the criteria and standards
contained in Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review. Existing trees and hedgerows shall be
incorporated into site design and preserved to the maximum extent possible. Street trees/landscaping
shall be incorporated into landscaping plans. Buildings constructed with a visible metal exterior are not
permitted. All building elevations that are visible from a public street must be attractively designed,
with windows and/or other architectural elements and features such that no visible elevation looks like
the back of a building.
B. Historic structures shall be preserved and incorporated into site design to the maximum extent
possible.
C. Existing healthy trees of 6 inch caliper and greater (to be survey-located either singly or as groups)
shall be incorporated into the site plan to the maximum extent possible. Similarly, significant stands
(10 or more trees) of related species, or consistent scrub-shrub groupings occurring in front, side or rear
yards shall be preserved whenever feasible. Welling or mounding are recommended techniques when
grade changes are required.
D. Driveway lighting in close proximity to Buckland Road shall incorporate standard fixtures and poles in
order to obtain a uniform lighting appearance along Buckland Road. The remainder of the driveway/
parking lot lighting shall incorporate standard fixtures (or equivalent) from the Gateway Lighting
Plan.
E. All business, servicing, or processing, shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings, with
the following exceptions:
1. Off-street parking/loading;
2. Seasonal outdoor dining (in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.15);
3. Outdoor amenities normally conducted as accessory uses to a hotel, such as swimming pool and
patio;
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-16
4. Outside display of merchandise for sale on the interior part of a pedestrian environment such as in
a village-style shopping center, or a courtyard area with kiosks or market carts, where outside
merchandise display is an integral part of the theme and thus enhances the appearance of the site.
This section is not intended to allow outside display of merchandise typically sold inside retail
stores in conventional shopping areas; rather, it is intended to encourage true pedestrian-oriented
areas in a village atmosphere.
F. Outside dining and display areas shall not occupy sidewalks intended for pedestrian passage and
access. Outside dining and display areas must be shown on the site plan and approved by the
Commission.
G. For the purpose of this Section, garden shops that are contained within walls shall be permitted even
though the enclosure does not have a partial or complete roof. The applicant may propose, and the
Commission may accept, a ventilated wall similar in appearance to the rest of the building. A fence is
not a wall.
H. Areas reserved for open space and set aside to meet impervious coverage requirements shall be
distributed throughout the site in such a manner that the land is visible (from public streets) and/or useable
(e.g., for pedestrian circulation, outdoor entertainment and cultural events, band shell, or arts/crafts
shows).
I. Outdoor storage is prohibited except as expressly permitted in paragraph 4.2.9.E.4 above.
J. Loading docks/receiving areas shall not be visible from public streets or from residential zones. All
loading docks shall be designed as an integral part of the building, shall be suitably screened, and shall
not detract from the appearance of the building and site.
K. Satellite dishes shall be screened so they are not visible from public streets.
4.2.10 Specific Site Appearance Requirements for Retail Establishments
The following additional objectives and standards apply to all retail establishments. Items designated as
objectives are not mandatory, but are stated in order to provide insight regarding the Towns design
objectives. Items designated as standards are mandatory. All design details are subject to Commission
approval.
A. Facades and Exterior Walls
Objective: Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal
appearances of retail buildings and provide visual interest. The intent is to encourage a more human scale
that South Windsor residents will be able to identify with their community.
Standards:
1. Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane
projections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the facade and extending at
least 20% of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 100
horizontal feet.
2. Ground-floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas,
awnings, or other architectural features along no less than 60% of their horizontal length.
Alternatively, other pedestrian-attractive features such as benches, niches, plantings, and pavers,
may be used to create pedestrian interest, subject to Commission approval.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-17
B. Detail Features
Objective: Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest at the scale
of the pedestrian, reduce massive aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. The elements in the
following standard should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim or
graphics, or paint.
Standards: Building facades must include a repeating pattern of at least two of the elements listed below or
of other architectural features. At least 1 of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall
repeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet.
1. Color change;
2. Texture change;
3. Material module change; or
4. Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less than 12 inches in
width, such as an offset or reveal.
C. Roofs
Objective: Variations in rooflines should be used to add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large
buildings. Roof features should complement the character of adjoining neighborhoods.
Standards: Roofs shall have no less than two of the following features:
1. Overhanging eaves, extending no less than 3 feet past the supporting walls;
2. Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the supporting walls, with an average slope
greater than or equal to 1 foot of vertical rise for every 3 feet of horizontal run and less than or
equal to 1 foot of vertical rise for every 1 foot of horizontal run;
3. Three or more roof slope planes; or
4. Other roof features.
5. In addition, rooftop mechanical equipment must be set back from building edges, appropriately
screened and/or located so the equipment is not visible from public streets.
D. Materials and Colors
Objective: Exterior building materials and colors comprise a significant part of the visual impact of a
building. Therefore, they should be aesthetically pleasing and, where appropriate, compatible with
materials and colors used in adjoining neighborhoods.
Standards: Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials. These include, with- out
limitation:
1. Brick;
2. Wood;
3. Sandstone;
4. Other native stone;
5. Textured concrete masonry units; and
6. Glass.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-18
Predominant exterior building materials shall not include the following:
1. Smooth-faced concrete block;
2. Tilt-up concrete panels;
3. Pre-fabricated steel panels; or,
4. Fiberglass or metal (excluding metal roofs).
Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or earth tone colors. The use of high intensity
colors or fluorescent colors is prohibited.
Neon tubing or similar lighting is an unacceptable feature for building trim or accent areas, unless a waiver
is granted by the commission.
E. Back and Side Facades
Objective: All facades of a building should contribute to the pleasing scale features of the building and
encourage community integration by featuring characteristics similar to the front facade.
Standard: All building facades shall comply with the requirements of Section 4.2.9.A Facades and
Exterior Walls.
F. Shopping Cart Management
Objective: Shopping carts can become an unattractive facet of a retail operation when not actively managed.
Outside storage of carts and parking lots with shopping carts strewn around can detract from even the
most attractive building design.
Standard: Any retail business that uses shopping carts outside of the building shall have a Commissionapproved
cart management plan. The management plan must specify the retail operations cart
management program to prevent accumulation of carts in the parking lot. Shopping carts shall be stored in
a location and design approved by the Commission. For grocery stores as defined in paragraph 4.2.5.B of
these regulations, the management plan must require that the carts be returned to the approved cart storage
area immediately after use by the customer. The approved management plan must be implemented. Failure
to maintain the standards of the management plan will be subject to enforcement as a zoning violation.
4.2.11 Access and Parking
A. Access Management
Regulation of vehicular access is necessary to maintain the efficient and smooth flow of traffic, to protect
the functional level and maximize the traffic capacity of Buckland Road. An access management plan and
program has been developed to address:
1. Limiting the number of driveways;
2. Choosing driveway locations to reduce conflicts;
3. Designing driveways to reduce conflicts and the severity of conflicts; and
4. Requiring roadway improvements that reduce or control conflicts.
All sites within the Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone must be designed to incorporate all
applicable access management practices and techniques to accomplish the above objectives. Access
management practices may include such considerations as:
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-19
1. Shared access between 2 adjacent lots;
2. Consolidated access for contiguous lots;
3. Alternative access via side streets; and
4. Frontage roads.
B. Streets
All streets to be dedicated to the Town shall conform to all applicable Town ordinances and regulations,
including the Public Improvement Specifications and the Subdivision Regulations.
C. Off-Street Parking
It is the intent of this Regulation to create off-street parking that is creative and to achieve attractive,
innovative parking layouts that will accent and highlight buildings and features of the Buckland Road
Gateway Development Zone.
1. The view of parking areas from public streets shall be minimized through the use of perimeter
landscaping and berms in addition to any other requirements for parking area landscaping
contained in this regulation. Other landscaping elements such as decorative fencing, sculptures,
fountains, stone walls, or attractive walkways and pedestrian spaces are highly encouraged.
2. Off-street parking shall generally be distributed around buildings in order to ensure pedestrian
oriented/pedestrian friendly sites where pedestrians and the building architecture, rather than the
automobile and the parking lot, are the primary focus Not more than one-third (33%) of the
parking shall be located between the principal building and the public street. Corner lots shall have
not more than one-third (33%) of the parking located between the principal building and Buckland
or Oakland Road. The second frontage street shall have not more than 25% of the parking
located between the buildings and the secondary street. The following parking lot arrangements are
considered to meet these parking requirements and are encouraged:
a. Parking primarily or entirely surrounded by the buildings (courtyard effect);
b. Parking areas that are screened from Buckland/ Oakland roads by the principal building(s).
c. Parking distributed around three sides of the principal building(s), provided that not more than
33% of the parking is located between the building(s) and Buckland/Oakland roads.
d. The Commission may, in its sole discretion, grant a waiver to the provisions of this section for
creative, innovate and outstanding parking lot design with features that cause the parking lot to
become an integral design feature of the site. Such features could include (but are not limited
to) curvilinear designs; architectural pavement including pavers, stamped concrete; exceptional
landscaping.
3. No required front yard setbacks shall be used for parking or circulation (except for entrance drives
to the site).
D. Landscaping Amount
1. Parking lots located between a building and Buckland Road or Oakland Road (without any other
intervening building) shall provide at least 12% landscaped area. This landscaped area may
include islands between bays of parking, planted peninsula islands including peninsulas along the
perimeter of the parking area, other free-standing landscaped areas (with a minimum dimension of
at least 8 feet in its narrowest dimension), and any other area approved by the Commission.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-20
(Not more than 2 peninsulas may be located back-to-back. The purpose of the peninsulas is to break
up the parking lot.) In addition, all front parking areas shall also be landscaped around the perimeter
and utilize berming to minimize the view of the parked cars from Buckland Road and to highlight
the buildings.
2. All other parking areas shall meet the landscaping requirements of Section 6.4.6 Parking Lot
Landscaping.
E. Landscaping Design
1. It is the intent of these regulations to allow the applicant to have flexibility in the design of
parking areas. Parking area design is to take into account natural features whenever possible,
grading of the site, visibility of the site from adjacent public streets, and the even distribution of
landscaping throughout the parking area. The following are examples of possible layouts of parking
area landscaping:
Parking Area Sample Layout - Diagram 1 Parking Area Sample Layout - Diagram 2
2. Parking areas may be divided into individual bays (a bay is an aisle with a row of parking spaces
on each side of the aisle). Each bay must be separated from other bays by a landscaped island of at
least 8 feet in width the entire length of the bay. Terminal islands shall separate the bay from any
driveways or access ways. See Diagram 1. Note: the sole purpose of the parking diagrams is to
illustrate parking lot landscaping and possible arrangement of bay, not to illustrate possible layout
of parking in relation to building.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-21
3. Parking areas may be divided into individual areas connecting across bays. Such areas are to be
divided by landscaped islands at least 16 feet wide at every row of parking spaces. Such
landscaped islands shall occur at least every 10 parking spaces. It is not necessary that such islands
align with each other from bay to bay. See Diagram 2.
4. Other alternative parking designs, including covered parking or multi-level parking, may be
approved by the Commission in lieu of, or in addition to, the above designs when such alternative
design is creative and uses unusual layouts or landscaping design to achieve attractive,
unconventional parking areas.
F. Loading Docks/Receiving Areas
1. Loading docks/receiving areas shall not be visible from Buckland Road or residential zones.
Sufficient on-site vehicular maneuvering area must be provided; trucks destined to, or coming from,
loading docks shall not require maneuvering movements within the public highway. The number
of loading spaces shall be sufficient to accommodate the anticipated loading requirements of
building users, which requirements shall be in accordance with industry practice, but not to exceed
said requirement.
2. No loading, trash removal or compaction, or other such operations shall be permitted between the
hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. unless the applicant submits evidence that sound barriers between
all areas for such operations effectively reduce noise emissions to a level of 45 db, as
measured at the lot line of any adjoining property. No truck deliveries or pickups are allowed
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
4.2.12 Pedestrian/Bicyclist Circulation
Sidewalks are required along site frontage. All Buckland Road sidewalks shall be constructed to Town
specifications. Alternative sidewalks or pedestrian access ways located within a site are encouraged,
provided that such alternative sidewalks interconnect to existing or future walkways on abutting properties.
The applicant is encouraged to provide site interior walkways that link street/drive walks with existing or
future multimodal trail systems.
4.2.13 Buffers
Buffers shall conform to Section 6.2.4 Buffers with the following exception:
1. Buffers are not required along Buckland Road or Oakland Road frontage.
4.2.14 Outdoor Storage, Trash Collection, and Loading Areas
A. Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding neighbor- hoods.
These areas, when visible from adjoining properties and/or public streets, should be screened, recessed
or enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts, the selection of
inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the problem. Appropriate locations for loading and
outdoor storage areas include areas between buildings, where more than one building is located on a
site and such buildings are not more than 40 feet apart, or on those sides of buildings that do not have
customer entrances. For a site designed with a cluster or village concept, trash storage areas should
be common areas not visible to the public, separated from the rest of the complex by appropriate
screening.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-22
B. Areas for truck parking, trash collection or compaction, loading docks/doors, or other such uses shall
not be visible from abutting streets or adjacent residential zones.
C. No part of a loading dock shall be located within 100 feet of a residential zone boundary.
D. Loading docks, truck parking, utility meters, HVAC equipment, trash collection, trash compaction, and
other service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping
so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are fully contained and out of view from
adjacent properties, public streets, pedestrian ways and public sidewalks; and no attention is attracted
to the functions by the use of screening materials that are different from or inferior to the principal
materials of the building and landscape.
4.2.15 Specific Requirements for Multifamily Residential Uses
A. Site Design Requirements
1. Objective: The site shall be designed to integrate the multifamily residential use with other
approved commercial uses (including, but not limited to, retail, office, and recreation uses) to
achieve a village-styled mixed use environment with the residential use fully integrated into the
development area plan including buildings that contain commercial uses. Such integration within
the development area shall also include shared roadways/parking, utilities, appropriate open space
area, landscaping/buffers, strong pedestrian interconnections within the commercial/residential
development and to other adjacent non-residential uses, and related improvements.
2. General Standards:
a. Multifamily residential uses shall be permitted. Buildings containing multifamily residential
uses may include, but do not require, commercial uses located on the ground floor and/or other
floors above the ground floor.
b. Multifamily residential units shall be either studio/efficiency units, 1-bedroom units, or 2-
bedroom units. Not more than 50% of the total number of residential units shown on a Final
Plan or a General Plan of Development or within a first phase of those plans shall be 2- bedroom
units.
c. The floor area of the aggregate of all residential units in the proposed development area shall
be limited to a maximum ratio of 2:1 to the commercial floor area shown on the submitted
Development Area Plan. Facilities for the sole purpose of support of a multifamily residential
use, such as club house, meeting rooms, offices, garage space, etc., shall not be counted as
either residential or non-residential floor area in determining compliance with the ratio.
d. The construction of a development plan may be approved by the Commission to be done in
phases. Projects shown in an approved Development Area Plan which are to be constructed
in phases shall generally require development of both residential and commercial buildings
which maintain the minimum floor area ratio between both.
The applicant shall submit a plan for ensuring conformity with Section 4.2.15.A.2.c
(residential / commercial ratio) including the phasing and timing of the construction
elements. Said plan and schedule must be approved by the PZC. The PZC shall require surety
to establish regulatory compliance. The PZC may require in its approval measures to be
taken, including but not limited to, the withholding of building permits and/or certificate of
occupancies to enforce approved timelines, percentages, and other conditions of approval.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-23
e. The size of a multifamily residential use which is under construction at any one time may be
limited by the Commission during the approval process by requiring phasing of construction
and/or a reduction in the number of residential units to be built in any phase to an amount not
to exceed 110 residential units per phase or development area as showing in the General Plan
of Development. The total number of residential units in the Buckland Road Gateway
Development Zone shall not exceed 200 units.
f. Each residential unit shall require a minimum of 750 square feet of open space within the site.
Such open space may be for recreation purposes (active or passive) or for preservation of
natural features (wetlands, wooded areas, open lawns, etc.) or both. Regulated wetlands can
not exceed 20% of the required open space.
g. Pedestrian and bicycle accommodations are required to interconnect to existing or future
walkways on abutting properties or development areas and to link to the street/drives walks
with existing or future multimodal trail system.
h. Parking shall be provided at a minimum rate of 1.75 spaces per multifamily residential unit and
may be designated in open lot parking, carports, or garages. Parking spaces shall be a minimum
of 9 feet wide by 18 feet deep. Parking spaces in multi-story parking garages may be smaller
subject to approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission. A reduction in the number of
parking spaces will be allowed when the Planning and Zoning Commission deems the reduction
to be in the best interests of the Town according to the requirements in Section 6.4.9.
Unenclosed parking of recreational vehicles is prohibited.
i. Infrastructure improvements such as utilities, roadways, and related improvements shall conform
to Town design standards. Twenty-four (24) foot pavement width for driveways is
acceptable. Standards may be reduced or waived as deemed appropriate and approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. All utilities shall be underground. Sidewalks shall be
required to appropriately interconnect the proposed development with other uses on the site or
adjacent sites and also wherever deemed necessary by the Commission within the
Development Area Plan limits.
j. Roadways and utilities: Unless specifically noted by the applicant at the time of site plan
application and specifically approved by the Commission, all roads and utilities within the
Development Area Plan shall be owned and maintained by the owner (or owners) of
development area, an association or other entity formed to carry out maintenance utility
company, and/or a combination of same but not the Town of South Windsor
k. Solid Waste Disposal: Any solid waste stations (dumpsters) shall be placed on a concrete pad,
appropriately screened, and maintained. The location and design of the screening/enclosure
shall be shown on the plans submitted with the Final Plan.
l. Buffers: Required buffers, in accordance with Section 6.2, shall be provided between the
overall site on which the multifamily residential component is proposed and any adjacent
residentially zoned property which is not in common ownership with such site. Where land on
this site or the adjacent lot is restricted by a conservation easement, that land, at the discretion
of the Commission, may be considered to be a portion of or all of the required buffer provided
that the conservation easement area meets all of the buffer standards and requirements as
outlined in Section 6.2.4 of these Regulations.

2. Once a parcel is approved for the DC Zone, except as otherwise provided by Section 4.1 or Table
4.1.6A, all permitted uses shall be subject to site plan review and approval as provided by
Section 8.6, and any proposed use shall be subject to all other applicable standards as provided
herein including such standards that relate to the overall parcel as provided by Section 4.3(B).
3. An applicant may process a request for zone change and General Plan of Development as
provided by 4.3(E)(1), simultaneously with a required use application as provided by 4.3(E)(2).
F. Detailed Site Plan of Development for Issuance of Building Permits
1. No building permit shall be issued with respect to property in a DC Zone, or any phase, unit or lot
development thereof, except in accordance with approval from the Planning and Zoning
Commission obtained pursuant to the provisions of these Regulations.
Section 4.4 I-291 Corridor Development Zone (CD)
4.4.1 Purpose
The purpose of the I-291 Corridor Development Zone is to:
1. Establish a legal framework for land use alternatives that will provide the applicant with a wide
variety of development opportunities.
2. Encourage creative design proposals seeking the highest and best use of the land.
3. Empower the Town with a measure of control over the type and quality of development.
4. Provide development flexibility allowing the zone to be responsive to market trends, and help the
Town to realize optimum economic returns.
5. Promote high-quality development of the I-291 Corridor Zone with respect to building and site
design, environmental sensitivity and fulfillment of the community health, safety and welfare interests.
4.4.2 General Concepts
The I-291 Corridor Development Zone has been created and is meant to be administered on the basis of the
following concepts:
A. That the potential exists for the zone to accommodate a wide variety of land uses including
commercial, office/business, hotel/motel, conference center, service and light industry. That there are
minimal restrictions on the location of these uses within the zone provided that compatibility with an
adjacent development (within the zone) or existing land use in an abutting zone can be satisfactorily
demonstrated.
B. That all development exhibits a high standard of quality in construction detail, materials, and
appearance. That development reflects accepted professional standards of design and is consistent with
the applicable State and local standards, codes and regulations.
C. That site planning is an essential criterion of the I-291 Corridor Development zone. Sites developed
under this zone are intended to be carefully planned, both within the site's own boundaries and in
relation to surrounding properties and the entire I-291 Corridor Development Zone.
D. That this zone is intended to encourage smaller sites to combine with other sites in order to provide
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-32
larger-scale sites and developments. As an incentive to promote combining of properties, a 5%
impervious coverage bonus will be granted for property consolidation per paragraph 4.1.7.D.
E. That access management is required on all sites, in order to reduce the number of driveway cuts onto
Route 30 and/or other arterial streets to mitigate the deterioration of traffic flow generally caused by
driveways on arterial streets. Access management techniques include shared driveways (or provisions
for future shared driveways for the first site in an area), interior service drives, and other techniques
included in South Windsor's Access Management Program.
F. That all development be sensitive to environmentally regulated areas within the zone. That maximum
effort is made to retain and integrate significant natural features into the development proposal
wherever possible.
4.4.3 Permitted and Prohibited Uses
Permitted uses are those commercial, office, hotel/motel and industrial uses that reflect the purposes of these
regulations by careful attention to the appearance and siting of their buildings and/or site amenities, and that
meet all of the performance standards enumerated within this section and all other applicable sections of the
these regulations, with the exception of the following specifically prohibited uses:
1. Gasoline service stations/automotive sales, service and repair garages;
2. Casinos, arcades (amusement centers with coin-operated games);
3. Adult-oriented businesses (including but not limited to adult bookstores, adult theaters, massage
parlors, etc.);
4. Nightclubs, taverns, social clubs, and similar uses where the primary purpose of the business is the
serving of alcoholic beverages;
5. Any use similar in purpose, use, or service to the above-prohibited uses, regardless of its' name or
title; and
6. Residences/residential uses.
4.4.4 Consolidated Parcels
A. Purpose
In the interest of promoting development continuity, the consolidation of contiguous parcels is encouraged.
Consolidation is defined here as the integration of 2 or more individually-owned parcels into a single
Consolidated Parcel for the purposes of creating a shared-use arrangement of selected site components, e.g.
common points of access/egress, drive passage, parking, loading/unloading, building coverage and yards.
Side or rear yards may be ignored along common boundaries of consolidated lots.
B. Procedure
1. A consolidated parcel shall be developed with an integrated plan of buildings, parking, loading and
unloading, and open space.
2. The owner of each lot shall give to the owner of each lot in the consolidated parcel by deed,
easement, or agreement filed in the Office of the Town Clerk, the right of entrance, exit, passage,
parking, and loading.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-33
C. Access
The Commission may require or limit the number of access/egress drives and/or direct the placement of
same within a Consolidated Parcel such that only 1 or more of several individually or commonly owned
"sub-parcels" within the Consolidated Parcel would have a point of access/egress. Such restriction would
be in accordance with current access management policies and plans.
D. Bulk Requirements
Minimum lot frontage 300 feet if located on Route 30 or Route 5;
150 feet if located on an interior public street;
no frontage requirement if located on a
private street
Minimum lot size 5 acres**
Minimum yard setbacks:
Front 50 feet
Side 20 feet
Rear 20 feet
Maximum impervious coverage 65%*
Maximum building height See Section 4.4.5.C
Required off-street parking See Section 4.4.6
*An additional 5% impervious coverage bonus will be granted for: (1) any single site in excess of 25 acres
that is planned and developed as an integral site; or (2) any Consolidated Parcel (see Section 4.4.4).
** The minimum lot size requirement can be reduced to 3 acres if included in a Consolidated Parcel (see
Section 4.4.4).
E. Impervious Coverage Bonus
A 5% impervious coverage bonus may be granted for the consolidation of 2 or more lots that are
non-conforming to the minimum lot size requirement into 1 larger lot. When a non-conforming lot is
combined with a conforming lot, an additional 5% of the area of the non-conforming lot can be added to
the total impervious surface allowed.
4.4.5 Site Appearance Requirements
Development proposals for the I-291 Corridor Development zone will be reviewed for appearance and
compatibility. While creative design approaches are encouraged, quality in levels of detail, material
selections, and functional adequacy will be expected. Following are general guidelines:
A. Architectural and site design criteria and guidelines will be as described in Section 8.7 Architectural
and Design Review.
B. Relationships to land uses in abutting zones and adjacent developments within the zone
(compatibility) are important considerations that will be critically reviewed by the Commission.
Concerns in this regard will include view sheds; buffers (vegetative and architectural); building scale,
massing, con- figuration and height; light spill; emissions (noise); use intensity/frequency; light/air
obstruction; and signage.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-34
C. Building height shall be compatible with highway elevation unless applicant demonstrates to the
Commission that building height is irrelevant in a specific area. Taller buildings are recommended
where I-291 is above grade, so that the traveling public is not looking down upon a building's roof.
When this is unavoidable, the roof must be designed to be attractive from the highway; flat roofs are
not acceptable when below the I-291 grade and visible from the highway at any time of year. Taller
buildings are also expected to provide increased building setback from the street upon which they front.
In no instance shall a building exceed 5 stories or 60 feet, whichever is less.
D. The Corridor Development zone includes extensive areas of regulated wetlands and utility
easements/rights-of-way. These areas will be incorporated into site planning to provide (as appropriate)
multi-use trails that traverse the corridor.
E. All business, servicing, processing (except for off-street parking/loading) shall be conducted within
completely enclosed buildings. Outdoor storage and/or activities may be allowed only as a Special
Exception use if the Commission determines that the criteria in Section 8.4, Special Standards and
Procedures, as well as the following criteria, are satisfied.
1. Outdoor storage is NOT allowed for products and/or materials used in manufacturing,
processing, packaging and/or assembly of components or goods for sale or distribution;
construction businesses; or wholesale or retail sales (except garden/nursery centers accessory to
a permitted use). Outdoor storage, however, IS allowed as an accessory use to a product
distribution center, provided:
a. The maximum allowable area of outdoor storage is no greater than 10% of the total site area;
and
b. Such outdoor storage area is appropriately screened from public streets by effective
architectural and/or landscape architectural elements, which may include, for example,
extensions of building walls, plant materials, berms, fences, or a combination of one or more
of these elements.
2. Outdoor storage must be screened from public streets. The Commission may require that outdoor
storage also be screened from abutting properties.
3. Outdoor activities must be screened from public streets and abutting properties unless the
Commission determines that screening is not necessary because the outdoor activities do not
detract from the character of the development and the neighborhood.
F. Loading docks shall generally not be visible from Route 30 or I-291. All loading docks shall be
designed as an integral part of the building and must not detract from the appearance of the
building and site.
4.4.6 Parking and Circulation Requirements
Off-street parking shall conform to the requirements of Section 6.4 Parking and Access  Off-Street
Parking and Loading, as well as to the following.
A. General Circulation Requirements
Site plans shall conform to the guidelines and recommendations of the Town's access management
program. Circulation and access layouts will be evaluated for functional efficiency and safety.
Considerations will include limited driveway cuts along Route 30 (Ellington Road) and the incorporation
of shared access between adjacent lots and consolidated access for contiguous lots.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-37
B. Pavement Size
Contiguous pavement areas for parking (exclusive of islands) shall not exceed 1 acre, at which point a
major island division will be required. "Major island division" is a planted median extending the longest
dimension of the one-acre paved area and a minimum of 20 feet in width. Mounding is encouraged,
provided it does not interfere with sight lines.
C. Parking in Yards
1. There will be no parking permitted in required yards abutting Route 30 or I-291.
2. Side and rear yard parking are encouraged for all business and industrial uses.
3. Front yard parking, as the dominant parking area, will be considered for commercial and serviceoriented
developments only.
4.4.7 Pedestrian/Bicyclist Circulation
Sidewalks are encouraged between site buildings and parking areas. Sidewalks may be provided along at
least 1 side of private drives and linked with sidewalks on Route 30 where appropriate. Alternative
sidewalks or pedestrian access ways located within a site are encouraged, provided that such alternative
sidewalks interconnect to existing or future walkways on abutting properties. The applicant is encouraged
to provide site interior walkways that link street/drive walks with existing or future multimodal trail
systems, such as that connecting Manchester Trail with Bissell Bridge.
4.4.8 Fencing
Fencing presents a barrier to wildlife and tends to visually partition the environment, and, as such, is discouraged
except where required for security purposes. Fencing will be in accordance with requirements
for materials, height, setbacks and screen requirements. With the exception of special treatments that may
be architecturally related to the individual structure, fencing should be consistent throughout the site.
Barbed wire fencing is prohibited. An applicant can request the installation of barbed wire by special
exception in accordance with Section 8.7 and subject to the following criteria:
 Installation of barbed wire fencing cannot be adjacent to or visible from the public way;
 Demonstration and/or justification of installation based on security needs;
 No barbed wire fencing can be installed within 100 feet of a residential zone boundary;
 Any barbed wire fencing installed must be a minimum of 8 feet high; and
 Cross razor wire (also called concertina razor wire) is prohibited.
4.4.9 Conservation Easements
The I-291 Corridor Development zone includes extensive areas of regulated wetlands which, when
combined with other easements including wetland buffer areas, constitute a significant portion of the total
acreage. In accordance with the overall development concept, the Town is seeking to acquire a
conservation easement that will encompass the several discrete wetlands groups including various areas
of non-wetland lands. These non-wetlands that are associated by vegetation with the regulated wetlands
are essentially undevelopable because of their close proximity to the regulated wetlands and anomalous
configuration. It is the intent of this zone to establish conservation easements on a parcel by parcel basis.
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-36
Section 4.5 Industrial Zone (I)
4.5.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Industrial Zone is to afford South Windsor areas reserved for industrial uses, which
constitute well-planned, functional, and aesthetically-pleasing environments for a prosperous industrial
community; and which, by design, are compatible with abutting zones and uses.
4.5.2 Establishment of Zone
The Industrial Zone shall be established by the Commission only after taking into account the various
factors favorable and unfavorable to such a change, including but not limited to those criteria listed in
Section 8.3 Zone Change Standards and Procedures.
4.5.3 Accessory Uses
Accessory uses normally incidental to the principal use, including garages, storage buildings, and
power plants, as well as employee recreational, commissary and clinical facilities are permitted uses.
Incidental sales shall be permitted as an accessory use provided that: (a) no more than 20% of the
gross building floor area is devoted to such sales, or (b) in a landscape materials sales and storage
use, not more than 20% of the gross exterior display/storage yard is devoted to such sales, or
(c) not more than 6 sales events are held per year.
4.5.4 Storage of Material
See Section 2.11 Commercial and Industrial Storage and Display for outdoor storage requirements.
4.5.5 Rail
Rail spurs and sidings shall be located no closer than 150 feet from a residential zone, and are
prohibited within buffer areas. The above may be waived by the Commission in cases where the
proposed rail spur or siding will not, in the opinion of the Commission, cause undue noise or visual
disruption, or safety hazard, to abutting residential zones or uses. The Commission may require
special screening and/or noise abatement measures for rail sidings.
4.5.6 Building Height
The maximum building height is 50 feet/4 stories for any building that is at least 350 feet from a
public street right-of-way and from any residential zone boundary (excluding dedicated public open
space), pro- vided, however, that any portion of such building located within 350 feet of the public
street right-of-way or any building located in its entirety within 350 feet of the public street rightof-
way shall have a maxi- mum height of 40 feet/2 stories.
The applicant may request and the Commission may grant a height waiver to increase the building
height to 75 feet/5 stories for a building or portion thereof located at least 350 feet from any public
street and from any residential zone boundary, if the Commission determines that the site is suitable
for a taller building and that the character of the Industrial Zone is enhanced rather than diminished
by a taller building. In order to qualify for a height waiver, the applicant must demonstrate that the
taller building con- forms with the following criteria:
ARTICLE 4  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES
Page 4-37
1. The taller building does not unduly disrupt the character of a residentially-zoned neighborhood.
2. Relationships to land uses in abutting zones and adjacent developments within the zone
(compatibility) are important considerations that will be critically reviewed by the
Commission. Concerns in this regard will include view sheds, buffers (vegetative and
architectural), building scale / massing / con- figuration / height, light spill, emissions (noise),
use intensity/frequency, light/air obstruction, and signage.
3. A 5% reduction in maximum impervious coverage is required for each additional floor above
50 feet/4 stories. The additional green areas are to be distributed around the taller building, not
isolated in a portion of the site with low visibility in relation to the subject building. This 5%
reduction is applicable to the impervious coverage assigned to the tall building based on the
applicable formulas for the minimum required lot size.
4. Service areas and loading docks must be screened from public streets and residential areas.
5. All membrane structures are prohibited.
Section 4.6 Route 5 Travel Service Zone (TS)
4.6.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Route 5 Travel Services Zone is to create high quality commercial development areas
oriented toward conveniently serving the motoring public, the surrounding neighborhood, and the workforce
in enterprises along and intersecting with Route 5 (John Fitch Boulevard). In order to add to the
communitys tax base and to serve as a catalyst for further economic development in the corridor, each TS
area shall incorporate multiple land uses in a coordinated design, with an emphasis on exemplary building
and site aesthetics, convenience, traffic flow, safety and function. TS developments may only be
established at signalized intersections of US Route 5 and a public street and shall require site plan approval.
4.6.2 Prohibited Uses
The following uses are expressly prohibited in the Travel Services Zone:
Vehicular repair or other automotive/truck services or uses;
Automobile/truck/motorcycle/trailer or related sales, rentals, or leases; and
Overnight storage of vehicles.
4.6.3 Specific Design Standards & Use Restrictions / Guidelines
In addition to applicable design standards and requirements contained in this and other sections of these
regulations, the following design and regulatory requirements shall apply to developments within the
Route 5 Travel Services Zone:
1. Each TS development shall have more than one permitted land use, e.g., a motor vehicle
refueling/re- energizing station shall also have a convenience store, or another permitted use or uses,
such as a quick service beverage store;
2. Buildings/uses may incorporate drive-thru windows/service areas;
3. Architectural design shall be exemplary and exceptional for the building or buildings and

canopies within the TS development;
4. Particular attention shall be paid to excellent site design and function, including traffic flow,
land- scape architecture, site lighting, pedestrian and motorist safety, and convenience;
5. Outdoor display of merchandise or products  The Commission may expressly approve small
accessory outdoor display area(s) for designated TS locations as shown on a site plan, if such areas:
a) are in appropriate and safe locations; b) do not detract from the aesthetics and functionality of the
premises; c) do not contain display merchandise or products typically displayed inside a building;
and d) such outdoor display areas are well integrated into the overall site design. Outdoor display of
any merchandise or products for sale, lease or rental is otherwise prohibited.
6. Multiple-use buildings are encouraged;
7. Shared parking facilities are encouraged;
8. Drive-thru elements of a building are to be incorporated into the buildings architectural style to
achieve an integrated design and the service windows should be located to the rear of the side of the
building, i.e. away from Route 5. Drive-thru lanes shall have adequate motor vehicle queuing based
on the proposed uses;
9. The Commission may approve canopies for motor vehicle refueling/re-energizing stations that
observe less than the required front yard setback for such a structure, provided such setback is no
less than 35 feet from the property line, and such reduced setback affords a better site functionality
and design;
10. Dumpsters shall be substantially screened from the adjoining street or streets;
11. Access management shall be required in accordance with Section 5.5 Access Management;
12. A cohesive and attractive signage program for the overall development shall be presented on the site
plan;
13. The entire site shall be properly maintained, e.g., parking space striping and directional arrows, and
the timely replacement of dead, dying or degraded plant materials is required;
14. Mechanical elements and outdoor storage shall be screened from public view. Any outdoor storage
areas shall be expressly depicted on the site plan;
15. Shared access drives are required and are governed by provision of Access Management regulations;
16. Consolidated parcels shall be governed by the provisions Article 4, Section 4.2.7 A-D. The
Commission may waive or reduce dimensional requirements for an integrated Route 5 Travel
Services development, provided: a) the front yard setback is observed from all street lines; b) the TS
development establishes a common interest ownership entity which allows for exclusive use areas or
fee simple parcels internal to the development; c) the site plan depicts such proposed interior
properties / property lines; and d) the overall TS development meets all dimensional requirements of
the zone;

Section 5.2 Flood Plain Zone (FP)
5.2.1 Purpose
The Legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7-148(c)(7)(A) and in Title
8, Chapter 124, Section 8-2 of the General Statues delegated the responsibility to local governmental units
to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. For
the purpose of securing safety from flood, prevention of damage and loss and all other related dangers, and
of promoting health and general welfare by regulation and restriction of areas in the flood plain of rivers,
streams and water bodies that have or tend to have overflowed their banks, the following regulations shall
apply to the use of land, buildings and other structures in any Flood Plain zone.
5.2.2 Basis for Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA)
The following regulations in this section shall apply to all lands designated as special flood hazard areas
(SFHA) by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the Town
of South Windsor, dated September 26, 2008 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)
dated September 26, 2008, and other supporting data, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by
reference and declared to be a apart of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into
this regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map
revision is obtained from FEMA.
The SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A and AE, including areas designated as a
floodway on a FIRM. SFHAs are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the
flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study for a community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance Rate Map
are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for
a specified location. Also included are areas of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding, including any
area contiguous with but outside the SFHA indentified by FEMA, and where the land surface elevation is
lower than the base blood elevation (BFE) as shown in the FIS, and the area is not protected from flooding
by a natural or man-made feature.
5.2.3 General Requirements
A. Structures already in compliance: A structure or development already in compliance with this
regulation shall not be made non-compliant by any alteration, modification, repair, reconstruction or
improvement and must also comply with other applicable local, state, and federal regulations. No
structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, modified or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this regulation and other applicable regulations.
B. Abrogation and greater restrictions: This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this regulation and another
ordinance, regulation, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes
the more stringent restriction shall prevail.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-2
C. Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this regulation, all provisions shall be:
1. considered as minimum requirements;
2. liberally constructed in favor of the governing body; and
3. deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under States statutes.
D. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is
considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does not imply or guarantee
that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or uses permitted in such areas will be free from
flooding and flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of South
Windsor or by any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. The Town of South Windsor, its
officers and employees shall assume no liability for another persons reliance on any maps, data or
information provided by the Town of South Windsor.
5.2.4 Permitted Uses
A. Farming and agricultural uses;
B. Public or non-profit parks and recreation areas;
C. Wildlife sanctuaries or preserves when owned by non-profit entities;
D. The keeping of horses or ponies for personal use, subject to the requirements of Section 7.12.1 Home
Animal Agriculture;
E. The keeping of horses, subject to the requirements of Sec. 7.12.2 Commercial Animal Agriculture;
F. Rifle ranges constructed and operated to meet all applicable local and national standards;
G. Buildings and parking areas accessory to the above uses but limited to daytime occupancy;
H. Special Exceptions for the following uses may be granted subject to a public hearing and the
following conditions:
1. Uses
a. Bathing places
b. Picnic areas
c. Golf, tennis, country clubs, and hunting and fishing clubs
d. Boat landing areas
e. Horse stables and trails for recreational use
2. A petition for a special exception for uses listed above shall be submitted to the Commission by the
owner of the land involved or an authorized agent of the owner. All elevations contained in said
petition shall be referenced to Metropolitan District Commission datum. This petition shall be
accompanied by 4 copies of a site development plan in accordance with Article 8, which shall also
show:
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-3
a. The elevation(s) of the base flood;
b. The lowest floor elevation of all substantial improvements of residential structures, and
whether or not said lowest floor is a basement;
c. The lowest floor elevation of all new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures, and whether or not said lowest floor is a basement;
d. The level to which all new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures have been flood-proofed;
e. All public utilities and facilities, including sewerage disposal, gas, electrical, water supply and
stormwater drainage systems;
f. Topography of the land;
g. Proposed filling, cutting and grading;
h. The extent, location, and type of proposed structures; and
i. Streets and access ways, passable at all times for emergency vehicles.
3. After a public hearing, the Commission shall act on the application with particular consideration
to the following:
a. No development plan or exception shall be approved which is inconsistent with the public
welfare or safety or which does not fully safeguard occupants against the dangers of flooding.
b. Such plan shall not encroach upon the river bed so as to endanger other areas upstream,
downstream, or across the river or stream by reason of flood or pollution.
c. Within the floodway, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, repairs to substantially damaged structures, or other development shall result in
any (0.00) increase in flood levels within the Town during the occurrence of the base (100 year)
flood discharge, as certified, with supporting technical data, by a Connecticut licensed
professional engineer. Fences in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open
design.
d. All necessary permits have been received where required, including Section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972.
e. In the absence of base flood elevation data, the Commission shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation (BFE) and floodway data available from a federal,
state or other source, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements,
repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development in any area
of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding within the community are either elevated or
floodproofed to or above the BFE.
f. The Commission may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses without FEMA
published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is
available from any other source (in response to the municipalitys request or not), the
community shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be
able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more
than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-4
g. When base flood elevations have been determined within the SFHA on a communitys Flood
Insurance Rate Map, but a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Commission must
require that no new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have
sustained substantial damage or other development, including fill, shall be permitted which will
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1.0) foot at any point
within the community when all existing and anticipated development is considered
cumulatively with the proposed development.
h. All new development must be designed so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.

Resources Division, must be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and
submit evidence of such notification to FEMA.
4. Within the limits of the Flood Plain district:
a. All substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated to or above the base flood level, and the elevation of said structures lowest
floor shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect.
b. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall:
i.Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level; or
ii.Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base
flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. The adequacy of such floodproofing
methods shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, and all such
floodproofing measures shall be adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures,
velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood. Said
architect or engineer shall also certify the level to which said structure shall be floodproofed.
c. Above-ground storage tanks: Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are
located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation
(BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or
lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill
cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
d. Portion of structure in flood zone: If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood
Hazard Area, the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must
meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached
additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure.
Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire
structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone.
e. Structures in two flood zones: If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the
construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., a zone is
more restrictive than X zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes
any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main
structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire
structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.)

Page 5-5
f. No structures entirely or partially over water: New construction, substantial improvements and
repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located
entirely or partially over water unless it is a functionally dependent use or facility.
g. Compensatory storage: The water holding capacity of the floodplain shall not be reduced. Any
reduction caused by filling, new construction, or substantial improvements involving an
increase in footprint to the structure shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of
the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been obtained from
adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume
not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally
equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-
year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory
volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body.
Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
h. Equal conveyance: Within the floodplain, encroachments resulting from filling, new
construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in the footprint of the structure
are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer
demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet)
increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent
to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage, shall not be constructed in
such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
5. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be:
a. Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure;
b. Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; and
c. Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
6. Development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; shall have all public
utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage; and shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
7. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate the
infiltration of flood waters into the systems.
8. All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration
of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and
on-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from
them during flooding.
9. The applicant shall provide the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new construction, substantial improvements or repair to a structure that
has sustained substantial damage, and also provide the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which the new construction, substantial improvement or repair to a structure that has sustained
substantial damage has been floodproofed. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-6
structure, the applicant shall provide certification from a registered professional engineer or
architect. The certification shall be filed on the land records in the Town Clerks office.
10. If a proposed subdivision, including the placement of a manufactured home subdivision, is
located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) the following requirements shall apply:
a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards; and
d. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available, the
applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis performed by a
Connecticut licensed professional engineer that generates BFEs for all subdivision proposals
and other development, including manufactured home subdivisions. The Commission shall require
the applicant to provide BFE data for all subdivision proposals, including manufactured
home subdivisions.
5.2.5 Variances
A. Variances to the provisions of this District shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. No variance shall be issued
unless said variance is consistent with the criteria set forth in Section 60.6, Title 44, Chapter I, Subchapter
B of the Code of Federal Regulations, June 15, 1979, as amended, and the criteria of Section
9.4 Zoning Board of Appeals.

Section 5.3 Office Conversion Overlay (OCO)
5.3.1 Purpose
The purpose of Office Conversion Overlay is to allow conversions of existing structures in the underlying
residential zones to professional offices and to facilitate the preservation of historic structures, where
deemed appropriate by the Commission, taking into consideration such factors as proximity to
commercial uses or zones, traffic volumes, amount of commercial traffic, and the suitability of the land for
office conversion.
5.3.2 Permitted Uses
A. All uses permitted in the underlying zone.
B. Mixed uses as described in Section 4.1.8 Mixed Uses in Commercial/Office Zones.
5.3.3 Special Exception Uses
A. Special Exception for conversion of an existing structure(s) into a professional office may be granted
subject to public hearing, submission of a general plan of development, and the following conditions:
1. The building shall have been constructed at least 50 years prior to the date of application for
approval.
2. The lot has frontage of not less than 150 feet.
3. An adequate line of sight entering and exiting the site is provided based on Connecticut
Department of Transportation standards.
4. Side and rear yards shall contain landscaped buffers of 10 feet in width. The provisions of
Section 6.2.4 Buffers shall not apply.
5. Any addition to the structure shall not be greater than 100% of the floor area of the existing first
floor.
6. Uses shall be restricted to professional offices, such as lawyers, architects, doctors/dentists,
accountants, engineers, real estate agents and insurance agents, as well as personal services
limited
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-10
to beauty and nail salons. Beauty and nail salons can occupy no more than 25% of the building.
All uses shall operate during typical office and personal service hours.
7. Maximum impervious coverage shall be 40%.
8. Wherever existing structures on the lot have historic or architecturally redeeming features,
efforts shall be made to preserve and/or enhance those features.
5.3.4 Locations
A. Conversion to professional offices will be considered by the Commission only for premises with
frontage in residential zones on the following streets:
1. Buckland Road
2. Oakland Road
3. Ellington Road
4. John Fitch Boulevard
5. Sullivan Avenue
6. Deming Street from Manchester town line to the intersection of Deming Street and the start of
Oakland Road.
Section 5.4 RR/I-291 Overlay Zone (RROZ)
5.4.1 Purpose
A. The area bounded by Chapel Road, Burnham Street and Long Hill Road is generally characterized by
existing single-family residences, including historic structures, and vacant interior property, with many
constraints to development, such as wetlands, electric transmission easements, and I-291 itself. These
constraints generally limit the vacant lands suitability for residential development, yet the existing
character of that area generally precludes large-scale industrial and commercial development. In
recognition of these contrasting development characteristics, and in order to preserve the residential
and historic character of the existing neighborhoods, the purpose of the RR/I-291 Overlay Zone is to
allow the development of small-scale commercial and institutional uses that are compatible with the
residential character of the area in such characteristics as:
1. Architectural character;
2. General aesthetics of the site;
3. Operational restrictions such as daytime operating hours; and
4. Site and building scale and massing.
B. The overlay zone is not intended to in any way limit or negate the uses permitted in the underlying
zone.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-11
5.4.2 General Concepts
A. Permitted uses in this zone will be limited to those low-intensity, low-customer/client turnover uses
that can clearly demonstrate compatibility with residential uses without relying heavily on buffering
and screening to achieve that compatibility (although buffering/screening will be required as
appropriate). Uses with high-client turnover are not allowed because the higher trip generation is not
compatible with residential neighborhoods.
B. Architectural scale must be similar to the scale of the surrounding existing development, including
building height. Architectural design, including roof design, must be compatible with surrounding
architectural design.
C. All development must exhibit a high standard of quality in construction detail, materials, and
appearance.
D. Site planning is an essential criterion. Sites developed under this zone are intended to be carefully
planned, both within the sites own boundaries and in relation to surrounding properties.
E. All development will be sensitive to environmentally-regulated areas within the zone. Maximum
effort will be made to retain and integrate significant natural features into the development proposal.
F. In recognition that the RR/I-291 Overlay Zone permits commercial uses in a residential-character
neighborhood, parking lot arrangement and landscaping must differ from traditional parking lots that
have large expanses of wide open pavement. Site driveways and parking areas will not be intrusive to
the existing residential neighborhoods. The location of the site driveway must be particularly sensitive
to the surrounding land uses and must be chosen with care.
G. Access management regulations shall be incorporated into the site plan where required.
5.4.3 Permitted Uses
All uses shall require Special Exception approval.
5.4.4 Prohibited Uses
Prohibited uses are all uses that do not meet the purpose and general concepts of this regulation. Retail
sales and high-turnover uses with frequent customer arrivals and departures are prohibited.
5.4.5 Site Appearance Requirements
A. Sites, buildings and landscaping shall be designed in accordance with the criteria and standards contained
in Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review. Scale and massing of site buildings and
structures shall be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
B. Architectural design shall be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Flat roofs are not permitted.
Buildings visible from a public street must have the appearance of traditional wood or brick
construction or facade. Buildings with metal facades are not permitted.
C. Historic structures shall be preserved and incorporated into site design to the maximum extent
possible.
D. All business, servicing, or processing (except for off-street parking/loading) shall be conducted within
completely enclosed buildings.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-12
E. Overnight outdoor vehicle parking shall be limited to 2 commercial passenger vehicles and/or vans.
Overnight outdoor truck parking (except for pickup trucks) is prohibited.
F. Business-related outdoor storage is prohibited.
G. Delivery receiving areas shall not be visible from the street. All delivery receiving areas shall be designed
as an integral part of the building and not detract from the appearance of the building and site.
H. Interior trash storage is encouraged. Where this is not feasible, all business-related trash and recycling
containers shall be placed on a concrete pad and suitably screened with trees, shrubs, fencing, or by
other appropriate means (e.g., the building itself).
I. Existing trees and hedgerows shall be incorporated into site design and preserved to the maximum
extent possible.
J. Site lighting shall be designed on a residential scale.
5.4.6 Parking
A. Parking areas must meet 1 of the following 2 design criteria:
1. Parking lots must be located out of view of the public street, either by location behind the
principal building or by retaining an existing wooded area that completely screens the parking lot
from the street.
2. If located in view of the street, parking areas shall be divided into islands of parking spaces, with
an island not to exceed 10 parking stalls. An island must be surrounded visually with separating
landscape elements including trees and bushes. Other landscaping elements such as decorative
fencing, sculpture/fountains, stone walls, or walkways/pedestrian spaces (consistent with the
character of the surrounding neighborhood) are highly encouraged.
B. Maximum efforts shall be made to create an unusual parking lot design that is aesthetically pleasing
and contains significant landscaping elements. Alternative parking designs may be approved by the
Commission in lieu of the island design when such alternative design is creative and uses unusual
layouts or landscaping design to achieve attractive, unconventional parking areas.
C. Required front yards shall not be used for parking or circulation.
5.4.7 Performance Standards
A. Hours of operation
1. Hours of operation shall be compatible with the residential neighborhood, and shall generally be
limited to weekdays during regular business hours. Regular business hours are defined, for
purposes of this regulation, to consist of Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. Any
business hours outside of regular weekday hours require advance approval from the Commission.
2. External vehicle operations such as truck deliveries and refuse removal must not cause disruption
to the residential character of the area. Deliveries, trash removal and other external business
operations (such as sweeping of parking lots) are prohibited outside of the normal hours that such
operations occur for the residential neighborhoods.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-13
B. Site Lighting
Site lighting shall be hooded to control objectionable and/or hazardous glare off the premises. No site
lighting shall project a beam of light other than at a sign.
Section 5.5 Access Management
5.5.1 Purpose
Traffic flow and safety can be seriously reduced by the proliferation of driveways along major roads. The
function of access management is to preserve the capacity and safety of the existing roadways. The
regulations shall govern access provisions along Sullivan Avenue and Buckland Road between Route 5 and
the South Windsor-Manchester Town Line, along Route 30 between the East Hartford Town Line and the
Manchester Town Line, and along Route 5 between the East Hartford Town Line and the East Windsor
Town Line. Developments along these roadways shall be governed by the specific provisions that follow.
The intent is to provide and manage access to adjacent development while simultaneously pre- serving
traffic flow in terms of safety, capacity, and speed.
5.5.2 Establishment of Zone
A Sullivan Avenue/Buckland Road Route 5/Route 30 Corridor shall be established. The Corridor
encompasses the entire street right-of-way of Buckland Road and the entire street right-of-way of Sullivan
Avenue between U.S. Route 5 and the Manchester Town Line; the entire street right of way of Route 5
between the East Hartford and East Windsor Town Lines; and the entire street right of way of Route 30
between the East Hartford and Manchester Town Lines. All properties that abut the street right-of-way of
Sullivan Avenue, Buckland Road, Route 5, and Route 30 are subject to and must conform to the
requirements of this regulation.
5.5.3 Applicability
A. The provisions shall apply to new developments or to substantial changes in existing developments.
A substantial change shall involve:
1. A change in use from residential to commercial;
2. A 25% or greater increase in gross floor area, required or provided parking spaces, employment,
or traffic generation;
3. A 10,000 square foot or greater increase in gross floor area;
4. A 50 parking space or greater increase in the required or provided parking spaces; or
5. A proposed subdivision of the property.
B. The provisions do not apply to access drives existing on August 5, 2000, where no application for
new development or substantial change in existing development has been submitted.

mph speeds.
b. Unsignalized Intersection Spacing/Corner Clearances: 150 feet
2. Unsignalized intersection spacing and corner clearance distances shall be measured between the
closest edges of the 2 pavements.
3. If the spacing requirements cannot be achieved, left turn restriction, joint-use driveways and crossaccess
easements may be required.
4. Variations may be permitted where they would enhance roadway operations or safety, for
example, 2 one-way driveways in lieu of a two-way drive.
5. Lesser corner clearances may be permitted on a temporary or permanent basis only when:
a. No reasonable alternative access is available.
b. The proposed location does not create a safety or operating problem.
c. The access is located as far from the intersection as possible.
6. Safe stopping distances shall be provided for all driveways entering the highway.
7. The centerline of driveways on opposite sides of the roadway shall line up with each other or be
separated by at least 150 feet.

and a pedestrian connection between the sites.
2. Joint-use and cross-access driveways shall incorporate:
a. A continuous service drive or cross-access corridor that extends the entire length required for
driveway separation;
b. A design speed of 10 mph, and sufficient width to accommodate automobiles, service
vehicles and loading vehicles;
c. Design features to make it clear that the abutting properties may be tied into the service drive;
and
d. A unified access and circulation system that includes coordinated or shared parking areas where
feasible.
3. Shared parking areas shall permit a reduction in the number of parking spaces if the peak demands
for proposed land uses do not occur at the same time.
4. Property owners entering into joint access agreements shall:
a. Record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties served
by the cross-access drives.
b. Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along Sullivan

closed after the joint-use driveway is constructed.
c. Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of
individual property owners.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-16
5. The Commission may reduce the required separation of access points where they prove
impractical if all of the following requirements are met:
a. Joint-access driveways and cross-access agreements are provided wherever feasible.
b. The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system.
c. The property owner enters into a written agreement with the town. The deed shall state that
the pre-existing connections will be closed after the joint use driveway is provided.
6. The Commission may modify or waive the requirements of this section, where the characteristics
or arrangement of abutting properties make a unified or shared access and circulation system
impractical.
F. Outparcels, Phased Development and Multiple Parcels
1. Development sites under multiple ownership, the same ownership or consolidated for the purposes
of development, shall not be considered as separate properties for purposes of access spacing
standards.
2. The number of driveways permitted shall be the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access
to these properties, not the maximum available for that frontage. All necessary easements,
agreements, and stipulations required under previous sections shall be met. These requirements
shall also apply to phased development plans.
3. Where, by reason of property ownership or phased construction, it is not practical to construct an
entire internal circulation system, then temporary driveway access may be allowed provided that
the temporary access meets all spacing, location, and related requirements and that the temporary
access will be removed once the internal circulation system is complete.
4. All access to the outparcel must be internalized by using the shared internal circulation system of
the main development. Access shall be designed to avoid excessive movement across parking aisles
and queuing across surrounding parking and driveway aisles.
G. Alternative Frontage
1. Access to lots that front on either Sullivan Avenue or Buckland Road and another roadway shall
be provided from the other roadway.
2. When a proposed residential subdivision would abut the corridor, lots shall have access from an
interior local road.

Page 5-17
3. If the existing road right-of-way width is less than the recommended right-of-way width based upon
relevant regulations (including the Subdivision and Public Improvement Specifications) and/or
plans (including any adopted Access Management Plan), the Commission may require that
additional right-of-way be deeded to the Town or the State in order to accommodate potential future
roadway needs.
I. Modification to Requirements
1. An applicant may request modification of these requirements through submission of an access
management plan that:
a. Encompasses a study area defined by the distance between intersecting streets or the length of
the sites frontage plus the distance of the applicable spacing standard measured from the
property lines;
b. Reviews existing and future access for all properties with the study area;
c. Evaluates the operational and safety impacts of any proposed modifications;
d. Includes a list of improvements and recommendations for implementation;

Section 5.6 Center Core Overlay Zone (CCOZ)
5.6.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Center Core Overlay Zone (CCOZ) is to promote the creation of a cohesive, mixeduse,
pedestrian-friendly area with a sense of place in the area around the intersection of Buckland Road,
Sullivan Avenue, Ellington Road, and Oakland Road. This zone is intended to foster high-quality
development of businesses and sites, with careful attention to the appearance of buildings and surrounding
sites and professional landscaping. It is also the purpose of this district to allow for residential use of upper
floors so that such buildings can contribute to providing for diversity in housing choices and
opportunity.
5.6.2 Definitions
The definitions from Section 4.2.2 of these Regulations are incorporated herein.
5.6.3 General Concepts
A. While the Commission would like to encourage property owners to develop in accordance with the
provisions of this section, the CCOZ is an overlay zone where the property owner may choose whether
to develop in strict accordance with all of the provisions of the underlying zoning district or in strict
accordance with all of the provisions of this section.
B. The CCOZ is intended to result in a mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly area with a sense of place. Since
the creation of a village-type setting requires careful attention to design and compatibility among a
variety of property owners and situations, excellence in site planning and architectural design is an
essential criterion of the CCOZ. All developments shall be human scaled, pedestrian/
friendly/pedestrian oriented developments with pedestrian amenities. All developments shall be
designed to be bicycle-friendly.
C. As authorized by CGS Section 8-2j and as recommended in the Plan of Conservation and Development,
the CCOZ is hereby designated as a village district where the Commission may regulate new
construction, substantial reconstruction and rehabilitation of properties in view from public road- ways,
including, but not limited to, (1) the design and placement of buildings, (2) the maintenance of views,
(3) the design, paving materials and placement of roadways, and (4) other elements that the Commission
deems appropriate to maintain and enhance the character of South Windsor Center.
D. Unless an alternative overall plan is found acceptable by the Commission, all development shall be
substantially in accordance with the development concepts expressed for South Windsor Center in the
Plan of Conservation and Development, including those for capacity corridors, character corridors,
street sections, pedestrian and bicycle connections, development opportunities and open space/
conservation areas.
5.6.4 Pre-Application Discussion
Applicants are encouraged to initiate a pre-application conference with the Commission to discuss the
conceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan for
informal consideration by the Commission. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review of
the concept plan, nor the Commissions suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any
portion of the application.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES

the specific requirements of Section 5.6.11;
11. Parking structures.
5.6.6 Consolidated Parcels
A. Purpose
In the interest of promoting development continuity within the CCOZ, the consolidation of contiguous
parcels is strongly encouraged and may be required by the Commission. Consolidation is defined here as
the integration of two or more individually owned parcels into a single Consolidated Parcel for the purposes
of creating a shared-use arrangement of selected site components, e.g. common points of access /
egress, drive passage, parking, loading/unloading, building coverage and yards, and implementing recommendations
of the Plan of Conservation and Development for capacity corridors, character corridors,
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-20
street sections, pedestrian and bicycle connections, development opportunities and open
space/conservation areas.
B. Procedure
1. A consolidated parcel shall be developed with an integrated plan of pedestrian circulation, bicycle
circulation, vehicular circulation, buildings, parking, loading and unloading, and landscaping. The
overall plan of the consolidated parcel showing how they will be integrated in conformance with
the recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development shall be submitted to the
Commission and shall be considered an integral part of the application.
2. The owner of each lot shall give to the owner of each lot in the consolidated parcel by deed,
easement, or agreement filed in the Office of the Town Clerk, the right of entrance, exit, passage,
parking, and loading for pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles.
3. As part of any new development in the CCOZ, the Commission may require the owner of a lot to
execute an agreement to be filed in the Office of the Town Clerk, granting the right of entrance,
exit, passage, parking, and loading for pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles to the Town and any
successors or assigns.
5.6.7 Yard and Bulk Requirements
A. To promote creation of a cohesive, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly area with a sense of place and to
encourage or require coordinated development and management among different properties within the
CCOZ, the Commission may permit development utilizing the following yard and bulk requirements:
1. Front yard setback 
a. From an arterial street  The Commission may permit a front yard setback of 25 feet from an
arterial street if the Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed development will
contribute to the establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as expressed in the Plan
of Conservation and Development. Otherwise, the minimum front yard setback from an arterial
street shall be 65 feet.
b. From an internal street  A building shall generally be placed at the edge of the sidewalk as
approved by the Commission except that the Commission may allow a building to be located
in an alternative configuration where the pedestrian-friendly nature of the streetscape will be
maintained or a public amenity (such as a pocket park or outside dining area) will be
created.
2. Side yard setback  The Commission may allow development with no side yard setback if the
Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed development will contribute to the
establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as expressed in the Plan of Conservation and
Development. Otherwise the minimum side yard setback shall be 10 feet.
3. Rear yard setback  The Commission may allow development with no rear yard setback if the
Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed development will contribute to the
establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as expressed in the Plan of Conservation and
Development. Otherwise, the minimum rear yard setback shall be 25 feet.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-21
4. Building placement  The long dimension of a building shall generally be placed parallel to the
public or internal street which it faces in order to establish a consistent street wall and a
pedestrian-friendly environment.
5. Maximum impervious coverage  The Commission may permit impervious coverage up to 80% of
the area of the consolidated parcel provided that appropriate best management practices as
recommended in the Connecticut State Water Quality Manual are utilized to mange the quality and
quantity of runoff and if the Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed development
will contribute to the establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as expressed in the Plan
of Conservation and Development. Otherwise, the maximum impervious coverage shall be 60
percent.
6. Maximum building coverage  The Commission may permit building coverage up to 50% of the
area of the consolidated parcel if the Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed
development will contribute to the establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as
expressed in the Plan of Conservation and Development. Otherwise, the maximum building
coverage shall be 25 percent.
7. Building height 
a. Minimum building height  2 stories unless the Commission approves a one-story building by
Special Exception.
b. Maximum building height  45 feet / 3 ½ stories except that no façade wall along an internal
street shall exceed 30 feet in height without being stepped back a distance of at least ten feet.
5.6.8 Site Appearance Requirements
A. Sites, buildings, signs, and landscaping shall be designed in accordance with the criteria and
standards contained in Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review.
B. The Commission may also consider the site appearance requirements in Section 4.2.10 of these
Regulations in reviewing and approving applications within the CCOZ.
C. All building elevations shall be attractively designed, with windows and/or other architectural
elements and features such that no visible elevation looks like the back of a building.
D. Street trees and street landscaping shall be incorporated into landscaping plans and large trees shall be
provided along public streets and private streets to enhance the pedestrian-friendly environment.
E. All business, servicing, or processing shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings, with
the following exceptions:
1. Parking / loading;
2. Outdoor dining where approved by the Commission;
3. Outdoor amenities normally conducted as accessory uses to a hotel, such as swimming pool and
patio;
4. Outside display of merchandise for sale on the interior part of a pedestrian environment such as in
a village-style shopping center, or a courtyard area with kiosks or market carts, where outside
merchandise display is an integral part of the theme and thus enhances the appearance of the site.
This section is not intended to allow outside display of merchandise typically sold inside retail
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-22
stores in conventional shopping areas; rather, it is intended to encourage true pedestrian-oriented
areas in a village atmosphere.
F. Outside dining and display areas shall not occupy sidewalks intended for pedestrian passage and
access. Outside dining and display areas must be shown on the site plan and approved by the
Commission.
G. Outdoor storage is prohibited except as expressly permitted by the Commission.
H. Satellite dishes shall be screened so they are not visible from public or private streets.
5.6.9 Access and Parking
A. Access Management
All sites within the CCOZ shall be designed to limit the number of driveways onto arterial roadways and
capacity corridors (through sharing of access and use of internal streets and character corridors), locate and
design driveways to minimize the number and severity of conflicts, and incorporate other applicable access
management practices and techniques.
B. Streets
1. It is envisioned that vehicular circulation will occur primarily on internal streets which will be
privately owned and maintained and constructed in accordance with the following diagrams
unless an alternate arrangement is found acceptable by the Commission.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-23
2. Any street to be dedicated to the Town shall conform to all applicable Town ordinances and
regulations, including the Public Improvement Specifications and the Subdivision Regulations.
C. Parking
1. Provided that two or more parcels enter into a consolidated parcel agreement and provided the
configuration of the circulation pattern within the consolidated parcel is acceptable to the
Commission and further provided the floor area of existing and proposed buildings within the
consolidated parcel exceeds 30,000 square feet and encompasses a variety of uses, parking within
the CCOZ may be provided at the ratio of 3.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.
This blended rate is intended to allow for the adaption of buildings to different uses over time. An
applicant may choose to provide additional parking. The Commission may allow this parking
ratio to be used for lesser floor area when they find the mixed use arrangement of the uses within
the consolidated parcel will provide for adequate parking for the various users and the overall
design concepts expressed in the Plan of Conservation and Development will be achieved.
Alternatively, an applicant may request permission from the Commission to provide parking at 80
percent of the rate required by Section 6.4 of these Regulations provided the Commission shall be
satisfied that the parking will be adequate to meet the needs of the development and further
provided that a consolidated parcel agreement will be entered into.
2. It is intended that required parking will be provided by spaces to be provided along internal
streets (the primary goal). Additional parking can be located in parking lots located to the
rear of buildings.
3. It is the intent of this approach to provide for adequate, convenient parking and to achieve
attractive parking layouts that will accent and highlight buildings and features of the CCOZ.
4. The view of parking lots from public streets and internal streets shall be minimized through
building placement and the use of landscaping, fences, walls and berms.
5. Parking lots shall meet the landscaping requirements of Section 6.4.6 Parking Lot Landscaping.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-24
6. Other alternative parking designs, including covered parking or multi-level parking, may be
approved by the Commission in lieu of, or in addition to, the above designs when such
alternative design is creative and uses unusual layouts or landscaping design to achieve
attractive, unconventional parking areas.
D. Pedestrian/Bicycle Circulation
1. Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of
internal streets and along one side of capacity roadways as identified in the Plan of Conservation
and Development.

adjacent arterial streets shall be constructed to Town specifications. All sidewalks shall be
designed and constructed to interconnect to existing or future walkways on abutting properties.
3. Extensive provision shall be made for pedestrian circulation such as crosswalks, benches and
other pedestrian amenities.
4. Extensive provision shall be made for bicycle circulation including bicycle racks and other
amenities.
5. Benches, trash receptacles, bicycle racks, and other amenities shall comply with standards
established by the Commission.
E. Loading Docks/Receiving Areas
1. Loading docks/receiving areas shall only be located where approved by the Commission and
shall generally not be visible from public streets.

functions shall only be located where approved by the Commission in order to be visually screened
from and audibly buffered to adjacent properties, public streets, pedestrian ways, bicycle ways and
public sidewalks.
B. Any such areas shall be screened, recessed or enclosed as approved by the Commission, especially
when such area is located adjacent to or near a residential use or zone.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-25
5.6.11 Specific Requirements for Multi-family Residential Uses
A. Site Design Requirements

Section 5.7 Center North Overlay Zone (CNOZ)
5.7.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Center North Overlay Zone (CNOZ) is to support the long-term development of the
Center Core area into a cohesive, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly area with a sense of place and to foster
high-quality development of businesses and sites, with careful attention to the appearance of buildings and
surrounding sites and professional landscaping. It is also the purpose of this district to allow for residential
use to contribute to providing for diversity in housing choices and opportunity.
5.7.2 Definitions
The definitions from Section 4.2.2 of these Regulations are incorporated herein.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-27
5.7.3 General Concepts
A. While the Commission would like to encourage property owners to develop in accordance with the
provisions of this section, the CNOZ is an overlay zone where the property owner may choose whether
to develop in strict accordance with all of the provisions of the underlying zoning district or in strict
accordance with all of the provision of this section.
B. The CNOZ is intended to result in a mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly area with a sense of place. Since
the creation of a village-type setting requires careful attention to design and compatibility among a
variety of property owners and situations, excellence in site planning and architectural design is an
essential criterion of the CNOZ. All developments shall be human scaled, pedestrian friendly /
pedestrian oriented developments with pedestrian amenities. All developments shall be designed to be
bicycle-friendly.
C. As authorized by CGS Section 8-2j and as recommended in the plan of Conservation and Development,
the CNOZ is hereby designated as a village district where the Commission may regulate new
construction, substantial reconstruction, and rehabilitation of properties in view from public road- ways,
including, but not limited to, (1) the design and placement of buildings, (2) the maintenance of views,
(3) the design, paving materials and placement of roadways, and (4) other elements that the Commission
deems appropriate to maintain and enhance the character of South Windsor Center.
D. Unless an alternative overall plan is found acceptable by the Commission, all development shall be
substantially in accordance with the development concepts expressed for South Windsor Center in the
Plan of Conservation and Development, including those for capacity corridors, character corridors,
street sections, pedestrian and bicycle connections, development opportunities and open
space/conservation areas.
5.7.4 Pre-Application Discussion
Applicants are encouraged to initiate a pre-application conference with the Commission to discuss the
conceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan for
informal consideration by the Commission. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review
of the concept plan, nor the Commissions suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of
any portion of the application.
5.7.5 Permitted Uses
A. Uses or Activities permitted by Special Exception: In addition to the uses allowed in the underlying
zoning districts, the Commission may approve the following uses within the CNOZ by granting of a
Special Exception in accordance with the Special Exception Considerations in Section 8.4.B and
Section 5.7.12 of these Regulations:
1. Construction of a mixed use building with retail or office use on the first floor and residential use
on the upper floor(s);
2. Multi-family Residential Use except that such uses shall be subject to the specific requirements of
Section 5.7.11;
3. Municipal facilities; public facilities; quasi-public charitable institutions; cultural facilities such
as art galleries and museums; and public utilities;
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-28
4. Other uses which the Commission finds will contribute to the overall Town Center ambience may
be permitted by the Commission by Special Exception.
5.7.6 Consolidated Parcels
A. Purpose
In the interest of promoting development continuity within the CNOZ, the consolidation of
contiguous parcels is strongly encouraged and may be required by the Commission. Consolidation is
de- fined here as the integration of two or more individually owned parcels into a single Consolidated
Parcel for the purposes of creating a shared-use arrangement of selected site components, e.g. common
points of access/egress, drive passage, parking, loading/unloading, building coverage and yards, and
implementing recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development for capacity corridors,
character corridors, street sections, pedestrian and bicycle connections, development opportunities, and
open space/conservation areas.
B. Procedure
1. A consolidated parcel shall be developed with an integrated plan of pedestrian circulation, bicycle
circulation, vehicular circulation, buildings, parking, loading and unloading, and landscaping. The
overall plan of the consolidated parcel showing how they will be integrated in conformance with
the recommendations of the Plan of Conservation and Development shall be submitted to the
Commission and shall be considered an integral part of the application.
2. The owner of each lot shall give to the owner of each lot in the consolidated parcel by deed,
easement, or agreement filed in the Office of the Town Clerk, the right of entrance, exit, passage,
parking, and loading for pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles.
3. As part of any new development in the CNOZ, the Commission may require the owner of a lot to
execute an agreement to be filed in the Office of the Town Clerk, granting the right of entrance,
exit, passage, parking, and loading for pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles to the Town and any
successors or assigns.
5.7.7 Yard and Bulk Requirements
A. To promote creation of a cohesive, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly area with a sense of place and to
encourage or require coordinated development and management among different properties within the
CNOZ, the Commission may permit development utilizing the following yard and bulk requirements:
1. Front yard setback 
a. From an arterial street  The Commission may permit a front yard setback of 25 feet from an
arterial street if the Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed development will
contribute to the establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as expressed in the Plan
of Conservation and Development. Otherwise, the minimum front yard setback from an arterial
street shall be the same as the underlying zone(s).
b. From an internal street  A building shall generally be placed at the edge of the sidewalk as
approved by the Commission except that the Commission may allow a building to be located
in an alternative configuration where the pedestrian-friendly nature of the streetscape will be
maintained or a public amenity (such as a pocket park or outside dining area) will be
created.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-29
2. Side yard setback  The Commission may allow development with no side yard setback if the
Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed development will contribute to the
establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as expressed in the Plan of Conservation and
Development. Otherwise the minimum side yard setback shall be the same as the underlying
zone(s).
3. Rear yard setback  The Commission may allow development with no rear yard setback if the
Commission finds that the arrangement of the proposed development will contribute to the
establishment of the vision for South Windsor Center as expressed in the Plan of Conservation and
Development. Otherwise, the minimum rear yard setback shall be the same as the underlying
zone(s).
4. Building placement  The long dimension of a building shall generally be placed parallel to the

Section 5.8 Route 5 North Overlay Zone (R5NOZ)
5.8.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Route 5 North Overlay Zone (R5NOZ) is to create a transitional overlay zone which
would afford property owners northerly of the Scantic River the opportunity to establish certain
commercial uses compatible with the remaining residential uses, while carefully managing building design,
placement, and landscape treatments in this high volume traffic corridor along U.S. Route 5. The goal is to
compliment the rural flavor here, while recognizing land owners potential need for commercial
opportunities. The area will serve to transition from the more rural surroundings to the built-up sections of
Route 5 in East Windsor and in South Windsor southerly of the Scantic River.
5.8.2 General Concepts
A. While the Commission would like to encourage property owners to develop in accordance with the
provisions of this section, the R5NOZ is an overlay zone where the property owner may choose whether
to develop in strict accordance with all of the provisions of the underlying zoning district, or in strict
accordance with all of the provisions of this section.
B. Given that this area serves as an entrance to South Windsor from the north, excellence in site planning,
landscape architecture, and building architecture is an essential element of the R5NOZ. All such
developments shall take into consideration travel speeds on the abutting highway and compatibility
with adjoining residential uses. Landscape architectural elements (e.g., berms and plantings) are thus
critical between proposed buildings, parking areas, and Route 5, and between buildings/parking lots
and residences. Low Impact Development (LID) measures shall be incorporated into the site design.
C. Locating of site driveways and parking areas must be sensitive and not intrusive to the existing
residences in the area.
D. Access management regulations shall be incorporated into the site design where required.
5.8.3 Pre-Application Discussion
Applicants are encouraged to initiate a pre-application conference with the Commission to discuss the
conceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan for informal
consideration by the Commission. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review of the
concept plan, nor the Commissions suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any
portion of the plan.
5.8.4 Permitted Uses
A. All uses in the underlying zone;
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-34
B. The following uses shall be allowed by Special Exception:
1. Municipal facilities and uses;
2. Day care facilities;
3. Offices  professional, commercial, corporate and business;
4. Personal service shops;
5. Recreational facilities (shall not include adult-oriented entertainment establishments as defined
by Section 7.2.3). Permitted accessory uses for indoor recreation may include:
a. Entertainment including music, sporting events and dancing;
b. Areas primarily dedicated to serving, preparation, sales and consumption of food and
beverages, including alcoholic beverages for special events; and
c. Auctions;
6. Riding academies, barns and stables;
7. Home occupations, home office, professional office (major), including landscape contractor
businesses and similar uses (see Table 3.1.1A and Article 7 Special Regulations).
5.8.5 Site Appearance and Performance Standards
1. Existing trees and hedgerows shall be incorporated into site design and preserved to the
maximum extent possible.
2. All parking areas shall be a minimum of 25 feet from the front property line.
3. Side and rear yards shall contain landscaped buffers of 10 feet in width. The provision of Section
6.2.4 Buffers shall not apply.
4. All outdoor storage must conform to Section 2.11 Commercial and Industrial Storage and Display.
5. Loading areas, truck parking, HVAC equipment, outdoor storage areas, trash collection areas and
other such service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the site and
landscaping so that the visual impacts and noise on surrounding residential properties are
minimized.
Section 5.9 Agri-Tourism Overlay Zone
5.9.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Agri-Tourism Overlay Zone is to allow by special exception additional agricultural
related activities to facilitate the preservation of farms by allowing them to diversify the use of structures
and conduct on-site activities (e.g. corn maze, sales of farm produce, weddings, educational events,
special events, wineries with wine tastings) where deemed appropriate by the Commission, taking into
consideration such factors as proximity to existing uses in the area, traffic volumes, amount of commercial
traffic anticipated, and the suitability of the land for proposed business, hours of operation, and impact on
future farming use of the property.
ARTICLE 5  OVERLAY ZONES
Page 5-35
5.9.2 Permitted Uses
A. All uses permitted in the underlying zone
B. Agri-tourism uses shall be permitted by Special Exception
5.9.3 Special Exception Criteria

ARTICLE 6  SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 6-1
6.1.5 Traffic and Circulation Considerations
To assure the smooth flow of traffic to and from sites and to minimize conflicts between pedestrians and
motor vehicles, Site Plan design should incorporate the following:
1. On-site queuing provisions must be adequate to prevent site-generated traffic from queuing onto
public streets.
2. Sight lines for exiting traffic from the site drive must be satisfactory for the prevailing speed of
approaching traffic.
3. The applicant must demonstrate that the design provides for safe and orderly vehicular and
pedestrian flow and movement of traffic and minimizes vehicular and pedestrian conflicts.
4. Delivery areas must be located so that normal business operations are not impeded or
compromised.
A traffic report prepared by a professional engineer shall be provided with the application to demonstrate
the adequacy of traffic flow and design. This report may be waived where the site-generated traffic is
minimal and the Town Engineer concurs that the traffic layout is acceptable.
Section 6.2 Landscaping and Buffers
6.2.1 General Landscape Standards
A. Suitable landscaping, including lawns and nursery-grown trees and shrubs, designed to be lowmaintenance
wherever possible, is required in all areas not covered by impervious surfaces, The
Commission may allow existing natural vegetation to be retained as part of the approved landscaped
plan.
B. A list of trees suitable for buffering, and as approved by the Town Tree Warden, is maintained in the
Planning Department. Invasive plants, as identified by the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection, are unacceptable.
C. Site landscaping shall be designed in accordance with the guidelines in Section 8.7 Architectural and
Design Review, and shall be designed to maximize site compatibility with the surrounding
neighborhood.
D. Stormwater detention basins that are visible from a street (including private streets serving the public)
must be attractively designed and landscaped, with side slopes no greater than 4:1 for maintenance
purposes.
E. Large trees and stands of mature trees and shrubs are to remain undisturbed where practical and
desirable. Existing healthy trees of 18 inch caliper and greater (to be survey-located either singly or as
groups) shall be incorporated into the site plan to the maximum extent possible. Similarly, significant
stands (10 or more trees) of related species, or consistent scrub-shrub groupings occurring in front, side
or rear yards shall be preserved whenever feasible. When possible, existing trees shall be saved by
appropriate welling and mounding.
F. All trees and shrubs to remain undisturbed shall be tagged, or otherwise identified, in the field prior to
commencement of site work, and shall be shown on the landscaping plan.

ARTICLE 6  SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 6-3
6.2.2 Maintenance of Landscaping
All landscaping elements portrayed on the approved landscaping plan, including buffer treatments, shall be
maintained in a manner sufficient to ensure its continuing performance and the survival of plantings. Where
a maintenance problem arises, upon order of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, said landscaping shall be
restored to a satisfactory condition consistent with the approved landscaping plan.
6.2.3 Obstruction by Landscaping
Landscaping shall not obstruct line-of-sight for vehicles entering and exiting the premises, nor shall it
unduly obstruct line-of-sight for vehicles traveling on abutting Town or State highways. Corner visibility
shall be maintained consistent with Section 2.8 Corner Visibility. Landscaping shall not obstruct line-ofsight
for vehicles entering and leaving either common driveways or other access ways.
6.2.4 Buffers
A. Purpose
The purpose of buffers is to mitigate visual, noise, and other impacts between residential and nonresidential
uses, and between low-density and high-density residential uses.
B. Standards and Design
1. For the purposes of this section, a site may mean an entire lot; or, when a parcel is to be developed
in phases, a portion of the lot that bears a reasonable relation to the building(s) for which a site plan
has been approved.
2. Wherever any non-residential use/zone abuts any residential zone, a buffer shall be required. The
buffer shall meet the following criteria:
a. The field of view between abutting residential and non-residential uses/zones shall be
obscured visually within 5 years time to such an extent that activity on the abutting lot is not
immediately apparent.
b. The field of view between abutting residential and non-residential uses/zones shall be
substantially obscured visually by the maturity of the planting.
3. Wherever any non-residential zone abuts any residential zone, a buffer is required on both sides of
the shared zone boundary line. Applicants are responsible for providing the required buffer on their
side of the zone boundary. Buffers are not required along street frontages; however, the
Commission may require screening. Buffers are not required between 2 abutting non-residential
uses in residential zones.
4. The following special exception residential uses require a buffer along all property boundaries
except street frontage:
a. Multifamily (MF-A, MF-AA)
b. Elderly Housing (Section 7.7)
When two of these special exception uses abut, the field of view between the two uses shall be
substantially reduced but not necessarily obscured, both within 5 years time and at maturity.
5. All buffers are in addition to required yards (building setback lines).
ARTICLE 6  SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 6-4
6. All buffer areas shall be designed by a licensed landscape architect.
7. Clear cutting/harvesting of trees within a buffer area is expressly prohibited at any time without
prior Commission approval.
8. The Commission may modify proposed landscaping plans to require more mature plantings,
different species, or alternative design, in order to afford a functional and aesthetically pleasing
buffer area.
C. Buffer Widths

will be so indicated on the site plan of development for industrial/commercial and high- density
residential developments and on the individual plot plan for single-family residential
development.
2. The Commission strongly recommends that developers begin installing the entire buffer on a
parcel well in advance of planned building activities for the balance of the parcel, as smaller
plantings can be utilized. The buffer may then exceed the required specifications at the time a CO
is requested.
ARTICLE 6  SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 6-5
D. Interplanted Buffer
Areas to remain undisturbed during construction activities (i.e., non-encroachment areas) shall be
indicated on the landscaping plan. If filling, cutting, grading, or other disruptive activities occur near nonencroachment
areas, trees and shrubs to be preserved shall be protected in accordance with accepted
landscaping practices. The methods proposed to afford such protection shall be identified on the landscaping
plan or in a corresponding document. The interplanted buffer shall be designed to meet or exceed
the performance level described herein. In addition, the following guidelines shall be followed:
1. Evergreen trees and large deciduous trees should be spaced using accepted landscaping practices,
usually 20 feet or more on center.
2. Flowering trees should be spaced using accepted landscaping practices, usually 10 or more feet on
center.
3. Trees shall not be planted within 20 feet of a sewer line or area of heavy equipment use.
4. Plantings shall be staggered/clustered to achieve maximum screening after 5 years, and at
maturity. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of 5 feet in height at the time of plantings; deciduous
shade trees shall be a minimum of 2? caliper and 10 feet in height at the time of planting; and
flowering trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height at the time of planting and 1½? caliper.
5. Suggested varieties of trees and shrubs include, but are not limited to, Canada Hemlock, Scotch
Pine, White Pine, Norway Spruce, Douglas Fir, Pyramidal Arborvitae, Juniper (including Red
Cedar), Rhododendron, Azalea, Holly, Forsythia, Viburnum, Lilac, Yew, Flowering Crab,

Elder, Cottonwood, Basswood (Linden), Catalpa, Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus), Silver Maple, Red
Maple, Black Locust and Chinese Elm.
6. Invasive plant species identified by the State of CT Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
shall not be planted nor included on any landscaping plan.
E. Non-Interplanted Buffer
When mature existing vegetation is not being incorporated into the buffer plantings, or when such
vegetation comprises a relatively insignificant proportion of the buffer, the buffer area shall be composed
of a suitable combination of evergreen, deciduous, and flowering trees and shrubs to meet the criteria listed
in paragraph 6.2.4.D Interplanted Buffers.
F. Alternative Buffer
In lieu of the interplanted or non-interplanted buffer, the Commission may allow an alternative landscaped
buffer design that meets, or exceeds, the performance level of the interplanted buffer. Said alternative
buffer shall include tree and shrub plantings, and may include hedges, earthen berms, fencing, or
other treatments.

6.3.7 Lighting-Related Definitions
Direct Light: Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the
refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.
Fixture: The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include some of the following parts: a
housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a
refractor or lens.
Flood, Search, or Spot Light: Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to
concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction.
Full Cutoff Light: A luminaire or light fixture that, by design, of the housing, does not allow any light
dispersing or direct glare to shine above a 75 degree horizontal plane from the base of the fixture. Full
cutoff fixtures must be installed on a horizontal position as designed, or the purpose of the design is
defeated, and disability glare will result.
Fully Shielded Light: Any light fixture that allows control of light beams in any direction.
Glare: Light emitting from a luminaire with intensity great enough to reduce a viewers ability to see, and
in extreme cases cause momentary blindness.
Grandfathered Luminaires: Luminaires not conforming to this code, that were in place at the time this
code was adopted. When a regulation grandfathers a luminaire, it means that such already existing
outdoor lighting does not need to conform to the new regulations.
Height of Luminaire: The vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire
to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire.
Indirect Lighting: Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.
Isolux Diagram: A graphical representation of points of equal luminance connected by a continuous line.
Such diagrams are convenient for making point luminance determinations, and are provided by the
manufacturer of the luminaire under consideration.
Lamp: The component of luminaires that produces the actual light.
Light Pollution: Stray or reflected light that is emitted into the atmosphere, beyond the 90-degree
horizontal plane. Dust, water, vapor, and other pollutants reflect this light, causing unwanted sky-glow.
Light Trespass: The shining of light, produced by luminaires, beyond the boundaries of the property on
which it is located.
Luminaire: A complete lighting system, including a lamp or lamps and a fixture.
Outdoor Lighting: The nighttime illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made device
located outdoors that produces light by any means.
Partial Cutoff Luminaire: A luminaire or light fixture that, by design of the housing, does not allow any
light dispersing or direct glare to shine above a 90 degree horizontal plane from the base of the fixture. Full
cutoff fixtures must be installed on a horizontal position as designed, or the purpose of the design is
defeated, and disability glare will result.
Temporary Outdoor Lighting: The specific illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made
device located outdoors that produces light by any means for a period of less than 7 days, with at least 180
days passing before being used again.
Uplighting: Any light source that distributes illumination above a 90-degree horizontal plane.

loading docks shall not require maneuvering movements within the public highway.
Access/egress for loading areas shall be designed to provide adequate, safe maneuvers in a manner
that does not compromise the efficiency and safety of parking areas. Truck maneuvers on
streets/drives, other than entering and exiting, are not permitted.
4. Where lots abut a residential or rural zone or use, loading docks shall not face said zone or use. The
above may be waived by the Commission in cases where the proposed loading docks are a
minimum of 100 feet from a rural or residential zone and/or will not, in the opinion of the
Commission, cause undue noise or visual disruption to abutting residential or rural zones or uses.
6.4.9 Modification of Minimum Required Parking Spaces
A reduction in parking spaces may be allowed when the Planning and Zoning Commission deems the
reduction to be in the best interest of the Town, according to the following:
1. The increase in stormwater run-off rate shall be held to a minimum by reducing the parking
spaces, and/or
2. The applicant demonstrates through actual experience that a lesser number of parking spaces will
suffice, and further that due to the nature of the building or business, future owners/occupants of
the building are also unlikely to need to number of parking spaces required by the zoning
regulations.

A. Illuminated signs shall be hooded so as not to cast direct light into or onto any property or building in
any zone, or into or onto any public right-of-way.
B. No lighting or sign shall oscillate, flash, pulsate nor project a beam of light other than at a sign.
Exception is the traditional, rotating, lit barbershop pole used only by an establishment licensed by
the State of Connecticut to cut hair.
C. A time and temperature sign may be lighted or contain alternating light, but only that portion of the
sign that contains the time and temperature; otherwise all other regulations apply.
D. Lighted Outdoor Advertising Signs
1. Lighting fixtures used to illuminate an outdoor advertising sign shall be mounted either on the top
of the sign structure, or if directed from the ground, shielded and targeted so that the lit sign and the
spill from that light will not extend beyond 10% of the perimeter of the sign. All such fixtures shall
comply with the shielding requirements of Section 6.3.3 Fixture Standards.
2. Outdoor advertising signs of the type constructed of translucent materials and wholly illuminated
from within do not require shielding. Dark backgrounds are required and only the lettering or
symbols may be lighted.
3. Flag poles, sculptures, and ornamental lighting designed to highlight architectural or landscape
features (trees, sculptures, etc.), must be shown with lighting proposed. The light should be targeted
directly at the object and should not extend more than 10% beyond the perimeter of the object.
6.5.6 Sign Measurement
A. Area of Individual Signs
The area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square, rectangle, circle, triangle, or
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, logo, or
other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part to the background of the display
or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including
any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall, when such wall or fence otherwise meets
zoning regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. The area of a sign within a wall or fence as
described shall be an envelope from left to right and top to bottom of all copy including logos, on the fence
or wall. Two-sided, one-unit signs shall be considered 1 sign as a definition in this regulation.
ARTICLE 6  SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 6-20
B. Computation of Height
The height of a sign shall be computed at the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top
of the highest attached component of the sign or support structure.

2. Determine if segments of this regulation have been proven to be too restrictive or too lenient by
experience.
3. Give the public a regular opportunity to speak to any aspects of this regulation they may feel is
too restrictive, or too lenient, unfair, or objectionable.
4. Allow administrative recourse made available by this automatic amendment procedure.
5. Provide a regular, consistent forum for all to be heard.
Section 6.6 Utilities
6.6.1 General Provisions
A. No development plan shall be approved unless:
1. Adequate public utilities, public sanitary sewers or Health Department approved on-site septic
systems, and storm drainage are to be provided by the developer or developers.
2. Clear evidence has been furnished of safe and satisfactory means of supplying potable water,
on-site septic and fire protection.
3. The proposed utilities, sewers, drainage, potable water supply and fire protection have been
shown to be adequate to accommodate reasonably anticipated future development.
B. The developer or developers shall also provide fire hydrants at appropriate locations when public
water is available. All Town specifications for furnishing and installation of water systems and hydrants
must be met.
C. Where public sewers are available, all sites shall be properly connected to an approved and
functioning sanitary sewer system prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. All sanitary sewerage
extensions and connections shall be done in accordance with the specifications in the Public
Improvements Specifications manual, the Connecticut Public Health Code regulations, and rules and
regulations of the Water Pollution Control Authority.
6.6.2 Individual Services
Electric power, telephone, and other cable systems shall be placed underground; except that the existing
electric power and telephone/cable system facilities may be used where appropriate for industrial and
commercial uses. This provision may be waived by the Commission only where the utility company has
ARTICLE 6  SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 6-29
determined that safe underground installation is not feasible because of soil or water conditions, or other
natural or man-made conditions. Where overhead wires currently exist on residential streets, they can
remain but any extensions must be underground.
6.6.3 Solid Waste Disposal
All dumpsters/trash compactors shall be appropriately screened and maintained and placed on concrete
pads. Dumpsters shall not be located within yard setbacks.
6.6.4 Spare Conduits
The Commission may require the installation of spare conduits and/or pipe sections to accommodate
future underground improvements where those improvements are anticipated to cross pre-existing paved
areas (drives/streets).
6.6.5 Storm Drainage
A. Design of the storm water management system shall be:
1. Consistent with the standards of the Public Improvement Specifications manual;
2. In accordance with the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual;
3. Consistent with good engineering practices (sealed by a licensed professional engineer); and
4. Based on environmentally sound site planning and engineering techniques.
B. Zero net increase of stormwater discharge to the Towns storm drainage system is to be maintained for
2, 10, 25 and 100-year storms, unless it can be demonstrated that there will be no deleterious
downstream effects from an increase in stormwater discharge flow. The impacts of increase in postdevelopment
stormwater runoff volume must also be determined and mitigated. Potential impacts to
receiving water bodies must be assessed and mitigated.
C. The best available technology shall be used to treat stormwater quality prior to off-site discharge.
Stormwater flows will pass through a treatment train consisting of primary and/or secondary water
quality structures in accordance with the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual (or later
version). This includes oil and sediment separation devices, maximizing on-site filtration and
engineered discharge techniques. The Town encourages the use of on-site natural filtration functions as
a part of currently accepted Best Management Practices in the reduction of sediment and pollutants and
to minimize discharge of pollutants to ground and surface water. Where feasible, roof runoff shall be
collected and reintroduced to the groundwater table via infiltration devices where soils and water
table depths may permit. Energy dissipaters and flow spreading devices shall be used to discharge sheet
flows over lawns. Storm runoff generated from parking and road pavements that carry sands, road salts,
oils, etc. are initially treated at catch basins where some heavy particulates are trapped in basin sumps,
and then further treated in extended detention basins or engineered structures to remove more sediment,
oil, grease, and other pollutants.
D. The applicant shall employ, as appropriate, the extended wet-bottom detention basin technique for
metering site-generated storm runoff prior to discharge to off-site drainage systems. Such basins should
be ultimately sized to accommodate more than 1 user. The applicant is encouraged to enter into an
easement agreement with adjacent lots to create a shared-use detention facility. Consolidated parcels
shall share a detention facility.
ARTICLE 6  SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 6-30
E. Rights to drain onto adjoining property may be required.
F. Stormwater detention basins that are visible from a street (including private streets serving the public)
must be attractively designed and landscaped, with side slopes no greater than 4:1 for maintenance
purposes.
6.6.6 Water Supply
A. Sites with a property boundary within 200 feet of an existing public water supply must connect to public
water in accordance with the State Public Health Code, Sec. 19-13-B51m, unless an exception is
granted by the Commissioner of Health Services.
B. All proposals for installation of private wells shall be submitted to the Towns Environmental Health
Officer for a determination of the feasibility of such proposed water supply.
Section 6.7 Pedestrian and Bicycle Accommodations
6.7.1 Purpose
The purpose of these regulations is to promote and support access by bicycle and walking throughout the
town of South Windsor. All parking lots must be designed to provide safe and convenient pedestrian and
bicycle access as part of any parking lot and site design, including safe and convenient pedestrian and
bicycle movement to and from public walkways and/or bikeways or streets, and between developed lots.
6.7.2 Pedestrian Design Standards
A. Access to individual buildings within the site shall be from a system of convenient and safe
pedestrian ways and shall be incorporated into the plans for any site development plan or parking area
in accordance with the following standards:
1. Pedestrian ways and sidewalks shall provide safe separation or delineation from motor vehicle
traffic through the use of raised sidewalks and/or landscaping between sidewalks and parking
spaces and /or driving aisles.
2. Pedestrian crossings shall be demarcated through the use of raised pavers, textured concrete,
pavement markings, pedestrian warning signs, and/or lighting as appropriate.
3. Pedestrian ways and sidewalks may be constructed of concrete or other decorative-type paving
material and shall include pedestrian warning signs and lighting, and shall not be less than four
(4) feet in width.

Section 7.14 Open Space Subdivisions
7.14.1 Purpose
The purpose of an open space subdivision is to ensure that residential development in South Windsor, to
the extent reasonably possible, preserves open space and the natural features of the land including
agricultural soils, wetlands, watercourses, and the rural character of the community, without increasing
over- all density. In the interest of promoting these objectives, development may be permitted on lots of
lesser dimension than would otherwise be required by Article 3, if the conditions set forth in this section
are met.
Previously Approved Subdivisions  All open space subdivisions approved prior to 8/1/99 shall meet
the Open Space Subdivision Standards in effect on 7/31/99. (See Appendix A)
7.14.2 Establishment of Open Space
All land within the RR, A-40, A-30, and AA-30 zones is eligible for a Special Exception for an open
space subdivision.
A. General Eligibility Requirements for a Special Exception
1. An open space subdivision shall only be permitted in the RR, A-40, A-30 and AA-30 zones. (Where
the Commission approves a Special Exception for an open space subdivision, the dimensional
requirements (lot area, width/frontage, and required yards) of the underlying zones, out- lined in
Section 3.1.2 Residential Area, Density, and Dimensional Requirements, are hereby superseded in
their entirety.)
2. An open space subdivision shall consist of parcels of land containing no less than 6 contiguous
acres.
3. An open space subdivision must provide for the preservation of open space in accordance with the
requirements of these regulations and the requirements of Section 4 of the Subdivision
Regulations
7.14.3 Pre-Application Conference
A. Prior to the submission of an application for an open space subdivision, the applicant must initiate a
pre-application conference with the Commission and its staff to discuss the conceptual aspects of the
proposed development, and to prepare and present a preliminary plan for informal consideration by the
Commission. The preliminary plan shall be designed to allow the Commission to make a general
comparison between the open space subdivision and a conventional development plan, and should
contain all necessary information to facilitate the comparison such as potential lot layout for both
ARTICLE 7 SPECIAL REGULATIONS
Page 7-25
conventional and open space subdivision; regulated wetlands; topography and areas of steep slopes;
wooded areas; other permanently-preserved open space within the vicinity of the proposed
subdivision; existing rights-of-way, road stubs, and potential roadway interconnections to existing
streets; and any other relevant information. The plan must incorporate the design guidelines contained
within these regulations and must reflect the preservation guidelines from the Town Plan of
Conservation and Development, the Open Space Master Plan, the Recreation Master Plan, and/or the
Agricultural Preservation Master Plan, as applicable.
B. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review of the preliminary plan, nor the
Commission's suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any portion of the
application.
7.14.4 Open Space and Development Densities
A. In all open space subdivisions, a minimum of 50% of the site shall be preserved as open space. At least
20% of this open space must be free of wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, flood plain zones, and
slopes in excess of 20% that extend 100 linear feet or more. The Commission, in its sole discretion,
may permit non-commercial recreational uses within the open space, provided that such uses are
consistent with the preservation of the restricted area and the character of the neighborhood. The
Commission may also permit activities and accessory structures necessary to support open space and
agricultural uses.
B. The Commission may modify any application so as to designate open space in locations other than
those proposed if such modification will further the conditions and requirements set forth in Section
7.14.7.
C. To determine the maximum number of lots permitted in an open space subdivision, the total area to be
developed shall be reduced by subtracting:
1. 50% of the wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, flood plain zones;
2. 100% of slopes in excess of 20% that extend 100 linear feet or more;
3. 10% of the total area for roadways; and
4. 100% of all designated use areas other than single-family lots and open space.
The remaining area shall be divided by the minimum conventional lot size permitted in the zone in which
the subdivision is proposed.
Example
Zone: RR - 40,000 sq. ft. lots required
Property Size: 100 acres
Less wetlands, slopes, etc: -22 acres
Less 10% for roads: -10 acres
Net acreage: 68 acres
Number of lots allowed: 68 acres ÷ 40,000 sq. ft. = 74 lots or the
maximum that a conventional layout plan
shows, whichever is less
ARTICLE 7 SPECIAL REGULATIONS
Page 7-26
D. Notwithstanding the number of lots produced by this formula, an open space subdivision cannot result
in the creation of more lots than would occur in a standard subdivision as demonstrated with a
conventional subdivision layout concept map prepared by the applicant.
7.14.5 Bulk Requirements
A. All parcels created by an open space subdivision plan shall be counted as buildable lots unless
specifically restricted from residential use.
B. Lot arrangement and dwelling unit design shall avoid juxtaposition of lots such that dwelling units are
stacked behind other dwelling units. The applicant may propose, and the Commission may approve,
lots behind other lots only with substantial vegetative screening between such lots. Stacked dwelling
units shall not be readily apparent from a public street.
Table 7.14.5A
Lot Area, Frontage and Yard Requirements
Minimum Lot Area
RR, A-40 20,000 square feet
A-30, AA-30 15,000 square feet
Minimum Lot Frontage 75 feet
Minimum Front Yard 40 feet
Minimum Side Yard 10 feet
Minimum Rear Yard 20 feet
Maximum Lot Coverage
RR, A-40, AA-30, A-30 20%
7.14.6 Design Guidelines
The development shall be laid out to protect and preserve the open space and to protect adjoining
property owners. The development shall also be laid out to achieve any one, or a reasonable mix of, the
following objectives:
A. To promote the preservation guidelines outlined within the Open Space Master Plan, the Town Plan of
Conservation and Development, the Recreation Master Plan, and/or the Agricultural Land
Preservation Master Plan;
B. To preserve and maintain all or part of any existing forests, fields, pastures and other land in
agricultural use, especially land mapped as Class I or II farmland soils, together with sufficient buffer
areas of not less than 50 feet, to minimize conflict between residential and agricultural use. The
Commission may waive the minimum buffer requirement where existing features exist which provide
an acceptable buffer at less than the required minimum;
C. That consideration is given to the preservation, creation, and connection of areas used for wildlife
habitat, recreational corridors and trails within subdivision open space;
D. That a provision be provided for pedestrian access between properties and for a perimeter design
concept intended to facilitate the networking of trails for pedestrian and/or equine use to ensure
recreational access to resource lands as provided for in the Subdivision Regulations;
ARTICLE 7 SPECIAL REGULATIONS
Page 7-27
E. That the location of the open space areas be primarily in areas which are contiguous to existing open
space areas or in areas of the site with the highest probability of connecting with future open space
areas;
F. That the scenic views and vistas, particularly as seen from public or scenic roads, be preserved;
G. That historic and prehistoric sites and their environs, as needed to protect the character of the site, are
preserved; and
H. That the visual integrity of hilltops be maintained by siting development so that building silhouettes
will be below the hilltop or, if the area is heavily wooded, the building silhouettes will be at least 10
feet lower than the average canopy height of trees on the hilltop.
7.14.7 Open Space Requirements
A. All developments under the terms, conditions and requirements of these regulations shall preserve open
space land to serve one or more of the following purposes:
1. The preservation of land areas outlined within the Master Plans;

Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review
8.7.1 Purpose
The Commission, in accordance with CGS 8-2, shall require architectural and design review for all new
construction of multifamily dwellings, DRZ developments, and non-residential structures. Design review
shall also be required for all substantial structural alterations made to existing multifamily dwellings and
non-residential structures (substantial is defined as any construction which requires site plan approval).
It is the policy of the Architectural and Design Review Committee to encourage the highest-quality design
of buildings and a more creative use/design of site plans, rather than practice censorship of creativity.
The Planning and Zoning Commission recognizes that the public is a captive audience to its man-made
environment. The purpose of architectural and design review is to:
1. Mitigate negative effects from exterior appearances of buildings erected in any neighborhood,
and thus to promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare and comfort of the community;
2. Promote and protect the public convenience and prosperity;
3. Conserve and protect the value of property;
4. Protect residents from visual assault;
5. Preserve the special character of existing neighborhoods;
6. Promote the development of a harmonious character in newly-developing areas; and
7. Encourage the retention and adaptive use of historic buildings.
8.7.2 Procedure
A. All applicants shall submit 3 copies of all items required under Section 8.6.2.B Site Plan Contents, no
later than the date of submission of a formal application to the Commission. Where possible,
applicants are encouraged to submit applications for design review in advance of submittal to the
Commission. Applicants are advised to make submittals as complete as possible to ensure minimal
delays in the design review process.
B. The Architectural and Design Review Committee will make recommendations to the applicant
regarding plan modifications that the Committee finds desirable, based on the standards and criteria
outlined in sections 8.7.3 and 8.7.4 as follows. The recommendations of the Committee will be
forwarded to the Commission, either at the scheduled public hearing or, if no public hearing is held, at
the workshop session at which the application is presented. Recommendations of the Committee are
advisory to the Commission, which has final approval authority for all applications.
ARTICLE 8 ZONE CHANGE, SPECIAL EXCEPTION, & SITE PLAN STANDARDS & PROCEDURES
Page 8-12
C. Findings as to the adequacy of design, architectural treatment and aesthetic character, and landscape
design shall be made in view of the fact that excessive uniformity, inappropriateness, or poor quality
of design in the exterior appearance of buildings erected in any neighborhood may adversely affect the
desirability of the immediate area and the neighboring areas for residential, business, or other purposes.
8.7.3 Criteria for Plan Evaluation
A. General Criteria for Plan Evaluation
The Committee will consider the specific criteria outlined below to review the following:
1. The basic design for the proposed uses, buildings, or development;
2. The relationship between the buildings and the land;
3. The relationship between uses and buildings/structures; and
4. The overall physical appearance of the proposed use/building/development and its compatibility
with surrounding development and the neighborhood.
B. Specific Criteria for Plan Evaluation
The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items that affect the physical aspect of South
Windsors environment. Pertinent to appearance is the design of the site, building and structures, plantings,
signs, street hardware, and other objects that are observed by the public.
These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather to assist in
focusing on design principles, which can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual
appearance within the Town:
1. Impact on the market value of existing structures in the adjoining area;
2. Effect on the health, safety and general welfare of the community;
3. Impact on the historic significance of the site and the affected area;
4. Compatibility with the Town Plan of Conservation and Development;
5. Location and dimensions of public and private streets and common drives;
6. Location and dimensions of public and private pedestrian walkways, sidewalk malls and paths;
7. Types, styles and colors of building materials, exterior facades and facing, fenestration, and fire
retardant characteristics;
8. Special architectural features;
9. Conformity with the South Windsor Building/Zoning Regulations, Subdivision Regulations, and
other appropriate laws, codes, or ordinances;
10. Relationship of width to height of new structures;
11. Colors, materials, location of lighting;
12. Design of signs; and

1. The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition with the streetscape, and to provide
for adequate planting, safe pedestrian movement, and parking areas.
2. Site planning in which setbacks and yards are in excess of zoning restrictions is encouraged to
provide an interesting relationship between buildings.
3. Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building wall extensions, plantings, berms,
or other innovative means to partially screen parking areas from view from public ways. Such
decorative elements should also be designed with public safety in mind, such that the public feels
safe during night parking.
4. Without restricting the permissible limits of the applicable zoning district, the height and scale of
each building shall be compatible with its site and existing (or anticipated) adjoining buildings.
5. Newly installed utility services, and service revisions necessitated by exterior alterations, shall be
underground.
B. Relationship of Buildings and Site to Adjoining Area

they shall be preserved and developed. Modification to topography will be permitted where it
contributes to good appearance.
3. Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces, and other paved areas shall provide an inviting and stable
appearance for walking and, if seating is provided, for sitting. Landscape treatment shall be
provided to enhance architectural features, strengthen vistas and important axes, and provide shade.
4. Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant varieties and other materials, and
by correlation with adjacent developments.
5. Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure, texture, and color, and for its ultimate
growth. Plants that are indigenous to the area, and others that will be hardy, harmonious to the
design, and of good appearance shall be used.
ARTICLE 8 ZONE CHANGE, SPECIAL EXCEPTION, & SITE PLAN STANDARDS & PROCEDURES
Page 8-14
6. In locations where plants will be susceptible to injury by pedestrian or motor traffic, they shall be
protected by appropriate curbs, tree guards, or other devices.
7. Parking areas and traffic ways shall be enhanced with landscaped spaces containing trees or tree
groupings.
8. Where building sites limit planting, the placement of trees in parkways or paved areas is
encouraged.
9. Screening of service yards and other places that tend to be unsightly shall be accomplished by use
of walls, fencing, planting, or combinations of these. Screening shall be equally effective in winter
and summer.
10. In areas where general planting will not prosper, other materials such as fences, walls, and
pavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel, and cobbles shall be used. Carefully selected plants shall be
combined with such materials where possible.

quality of its design and relationship to surroundings, as well as to its appropriateness for surrounding
zones.
2. Buildings shall have good scale and be in harmonious conformance with permanent neighboring
development.
3. Materials shall have good architectural character and shall be selected for harmony of the
building with adjoining buildings.
4. Materials shall be selected for suitability to the type of buildings and the design in which they are
used. Buildings shall have the same materials, or those that are architecturally harmonious, used
for all building walls and other exterior building components wholly or partly visible from public
ways.
5. Materials shall be of durable quality.
6. In any design in which the structural frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be
compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings.

accessories shall be harmonious with building design.
11. Refuse and waste removal areas, service yards, storage yards, and exterior work areas shall be
screened from view from public ways.
12. Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail,
form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting
of individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance.
13. Prototype structures (the first new structure in an area that has been designated for a particular
character) shall reflect the desired character of the entire neighborhood.
14. Stereotypical building designs that reflect a standard architectural theme or that are intended to
identify, or are typical of particular business enterprises are to be avoided.
E. Maintenance - Planning and Design Factors
1. Continued good appearance depends upon the extent and quality of maintenance. The choice of
materials and their use, together with the types of finishes and other protective measures, must be
conducive to easy maintenance and upkeep.
2. Materials and finishes shall be selected for their durability and wear as well as for their beauty.
Proper measures and devices shall be incorporated for protection against the elements, neglect,
damage, and abuse.

balancing aesthetics and function, and avoid monotonous patterns through such
features as staggered building setbacks and careful juxtaposition of buildings.
B. Applicants shall demonstrate to the Commission that they have considered, in
developing the plan, using passive solar energy techniques which would not
significantly increase the cost of the housing to the buyer, after tax credits, subsidies
and exemptions. Passive solar energy techniques mean site design techniques which
maximize solar heat gain, minimize heat loss and provide thermal storage within a
building during the heating season and minimize heat gain and provide for natural
ventilation during the cooling season. The site design techniques shall include, but not
be limited to:

Section 11.6 APPENDIX F
Designed Residence Zone (DRZ)
3.3.1 Purpose
The purposes of the Designed Residence Zone are:
1. To afford South Windsor innovative owner-occupied one-family dwellings that constitute wellplanned,
functional, and aesthetically pleasing residential environments, and which by design are
compatible with abutting zones and uses;
2. To increase the supply of affordable housing within the town; and
3. To protect environmentally sensitive areas of town that are unprotected through other means.
The Commission encourages the use of open space as a buffer between the public and the developed areas,
with the developed areas clustered into the interior and the open space becoming a visual open space
shared by the public (particularly when there is a natural feature that would enhance the buffer). The
development should consist of clusters of buildings to give the appearance of small neighborhoods with
open space between the clusters.
3.3.2 Establishment of Zone
The DRZ zone may be established after consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to the
supply of affordable housing in the town and those criteria outlined in Article 8 Zone Change, Special
Exception and Site Plan Standards and Procedures.
3.3.3 Form of Ownership/Occupancy
A. Ownership in a DRZ development is limited to common interest community form of ownership. All
land except that in the approved exclusive use area(s) shall be owned by the common interest community,
or, at the discretion of the commission, environmentally sensitive land may be deeded to the
Town of South Windsor or to a non-profit organization that will protect it in perpetuity.
B. The development shall comply with Chapter 828 of the Connecticut General Statutes, i.e., Common
Interest Ownership Act, and all other state and local common interest community regulations.
3.3.4 Dwelling Size and Type
A. The size of dwelling units shall not exceed 1400 square feet. An applicant may request a waiver of this
provision from the Commission for specific dwelling units after demonstrating good cause for such
waiver. Where a waiver is granted, the Commission may condition such waiver to ensure that the intent
of these regulations is not compromised. A variety of sizes is desirable.
B. Applicants may provide a variety of unit types. Affordable units shall be equally dispersed through- out
the development. Affordable units must have a mix of number of bedrooms, including three- bedroom
units. The applicants site development plan shall show the mix of unit types.
C. In addition to interior storage areas, each dwelling unit in a DRZ zone shall have 60 square feet
exterior storage.
Article 11- Appendices
Page 11-33
3.3.5 Area and Density Requirements
A. There is no minimum parcel size. The suitability of the proposed parcel for the Designed Residence
Zone will be determined based upon the criteria enumerated previously. The parcel must consist of
contiguous acreage not divided by a public street. The parcel shall have at least 200 contiguous feet on
a town-owned street, and the primary entrance must be located within the 200 feet of frontage. Where
the proposed number of units exceeds 65 feet, a secondary entrance may be required by the
Commission. The entire parcel must be located in the proposed DRZ zone area.
B. The minimum frontage requirement may be reduced by 1 foot for every 2 feet by which the
developments front yard setback is increased; provided, however, that the frontage is not reduced to
less than 100 feet. Where the increased setback/reduced frontage provision is used, no
pavement/parking areas/impervious areas shall be allowed within additional setback.
C. The maximum number of units allowed is 80 units.
3.3.6 Density Bonus
A. The overall density of the development shall be 3 dwelling units multiplied by the net buildable acreage
of the parcel. Density bonuses as outlined below may be granted by the Commission upon
satisfaction of the appropriate requirements. All calculations of proposed density must appear on the
General Plan of Development, and are arrived at by multiplying the requested density by the net
buildable acreage (see Article 10 Definitions). In no case shall the allowable density exceed 4 units per
acre of net buildable acreage.
B. In order to meet the purposes of these regulations and to increase the supply of affordable housing in
the Town of South Windsor the following modifications in density shall be allowed providing that all
other requirements of these regulations are met. In all cases the developer must show the Commission
the means by which these dwelling units shall remain affordable on resale as well as assure the
Commission that the units will remain owner-occupied. Furthermore, when the density is increased, at
least half the required affordable units must be made affordable by decreasing the square footage of the
unit, rather than leaving unfinished interiors.
C. Density bonuses may be allowed in accordance with the following:
Table 3.3.6A Density Bonuses
Percentage of Affordable Units
Allowable Density
(units per acre of buildable land)
15% 2.5
20% 3.0
25% 3.5
30% 4.0
D. In order to meet the purpose of these regulations and to protect environmentally sensitive land that may
not be protected under the authority of the Inland Wetlands Agency/Conservation Commission or other
regulatory body of the Town, State, or Federal Government, the Commission may at its discretion
increase the allowable density to not more than 4 units per acre of net buildable acreage and/or reduce
the required percentage of affordable units, providing that the developer furnishes the Commission an
acceptable method by which such land shall remain undisturbed over time.

In addition to closets and similar inside storage, each dwelling unit shall have storage area of a minimum
of 60 square feet. All such storage areas shall be located either in a basement with exterior entrance or in a
garage.
3.3.9 Parking and Access Ways
A. Dwelling units shall be located at a distance from off-street parking as determined by the
Commission; however, no dwelling unit shall be located more than 100 feet from the parking spaces

no undue hindrance to the safety conditions of existing or proposed streets.
3.3.10 Bus Shelters
A. In the event regular public passenger transportation will be available to residents of the development, a
shelter shall be provided by the developer at a location convenient to the residents and readily
serviceable by the passenger transportation operator. The design and material composition of a shelter
shall be approved by the Commission. This bus shelter may be the same shelter as the School Bus
Shelter described below.

conference, nor shall the Commission be bound by any such
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
14
review. Staff recommendations at the pre-application conference do not
constitute formal staff review; formal staff review will be made at the time of
application and may result in additional recommendations.
e. At this conference, if more stringent provisions or standards are required due
to site conditions, these provisions or standards will be made known to the
applicant.
3. Concept Plan - Pre-Application Conference with Commission
a. Applicants with large subdivisions may request an informal review by the
Commission prior to application submission. The purpose of the concept plan
is to provide Commission input in the formative stages of subdivision design.

to the Chairman of the Commission. If a concept plan informal review is
granted, the applicant shall submit the items stipulated in Section H for
concept plan at least seven calendar days in advance of the Commission
meeting at which the informal review is scheduled. (Consult Planning
Department staff for number of copies to submit.)
c. The applicant shall not be bound by any concept plan for which review is
requested, nor shall the Commission be bound by any such review.
C. Application
1. Content
An application for subdivision shall include the items specified in Appendix A of
these regulations, which constitutes a checklist of items to be submitted.
2. Application Submission and Official Receipt Time Frames
Applications shall be officially received only at regular monthly meetings of the
Commission (generally once per month -- consult the Planning Department for
regular meeting dates). Applicants are encouraged to submit applications at least
14 calendar days prior to regular meeting. Submission of incomplete applications
may result in rejection of same.

specified in Section H, and (2) the Planning Department has notified the applicant,
Design & Improvement Standards
15
in writing, of the deficiencies in the application within 14 days of submission of
the application. The Commission or its agents may subsequently require (1)
correction of any information found to be either in error or not in conformance
with town regulations and standards, and/or (2) submission of additional
information not specified in the regulations, as is reasonably necessary to make an
informed decision. The application shall not be deemed incomplete for lack of any
such additional information or any revisions in the accompanying documents so
required.

to the Town of South Windsor under Section 4.C.1.b(2), the Town Council will be
advised by the Commission that said application is pending and the date on which
the public hearing will be held, for the purpose of obtaining Town Council
agreement regarding the proposed open space. If the Town Council's
recommendation is unfavorable, the Commission will schedule a meeting with the
Council and the applicant prior to the public hearing to discuss the proposed open
space. The focus of the meeting will be to obtain maximum consensus among all
parties regarding the open space. If the Commission and the Council fail to reach
an agreement, the Commission will direct the applicant to seek an alternative
entity (per Section 4.C.1.g) to which the open space will be dedicated if the
subdivision is approved.
If the Town Council has not forwarded its recommendation prior to or at the
scheduled public hearing, it shall be presumed that the Town Council does not
disapprove of the proposed open space.

CHAPTER 4: DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT
STANDARDS
A. Purpose
The purpose of good subdivision design is to create a functional and attractive
development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure a project that will be an asset
to the community. To promote this purpose, the subdivision shall conform to the
following standards, which are designed to result in a well-planned community without
adding unnecessarily to development costs.
B. General Design Requirements
B.1. Regulations and Zoning
a. All portions of any subdivision shall conform to the health and public safety
regulations of the Town of South Windsor and the State of Connecticut, the
Town Zoning Regulations, and the Public Improvement Specifications
manual. All land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be
used for building/development purposes without danger to health and safety.
All portions of any subdivision shall conform to these subdivision
regulations. The Commission may grant a waiver to specific sections of these
regulations only where such waiver provision is included within these
regulations.
b. Subdivisions should generally be consistent with the Town Plan of
Development and other applicable local plans.
c. Minimum lot area, frontage, or depth may be waived by the Commission in
not over 10% of the lots in a subdivision where the shape of the parcel,
topography, or other natural features prevent the best subdivision in strict
conformance to the lot sizes and areas required.
d. No privately owned reserved strips that control access to land dedicated to
public use, or which may be so dedicated (for example, streets or open space),
will be permitted.
B.2. Natural Features
a. Improvements on the site shall be located to preserve the natural features of
the site to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid areas of environmental
sensitivity, and to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural
features.
b. The following specific areas shall be conserved, either as dedicated open
space or via appropriate conservation mechanisms, to the extent consistent
with the reasonable utilization of land and in accordance with other
applicable local regulations. If it appears that such area(s) may exist on the
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
26
site, the Commission may seek expert input or may require the applicant to
provide expert input regarding the existence and/or relative value of such
areas.
(1) Unique and/or fragile areas;
(2) Significant mature trees or significant mature stands of trees;
(3) Habitats of endangered wildlife, as identified on federal or state lists;
(4) Historically/archaeologically significant structures and sites;
(5) Slopes in excess of l5%. Where construction is proposed on slopes in
excess of 15%, additional engineering/best management practices may
be required for slope stabilization/conservation.
c. The subdivider shall preserve to the fullest extent possible all trees except
those required to be removed by building construction or public
improvements. Subsequent to subdivision approval, a waiver (change order)
may be requested by the prospective homeowner.
d. The development shall be laid out to reduce cuts and fills; to avoid
unnecessary impervious cover; to provide adequate access to lots; and to
mitigate adverse effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities
on neighboring properties.
B.3. Solar Design
Applicants shall demonstrate to the Commission that they have considered, in
developing the plan, the use of passive solar energy techniques that would not
significantly increase the cost of the housing to the buyer, after tax credits,
subsidies, and exemptions. Passive solar energy techniques mean site design
techniques that maximize solar heat gain, minimize heat loss and provide thermal
storage within a building during the heating season, and minimize heat gain and
provide for natural ventilation during the cooling season. The site design
techniques shall include, but not be limited to:
a. House orientation;
b. Street and lot layout;
c. Vegetation;
d. Natural and man-made topographical features; and,
e. Protection of solar access within the development.
B.4. Residential Development Design
a. Residential lots shall generally front on residential access (local) streets, not
on collector streets. The Commission may waive this requirement for a very
limited number of lots, only upon substantial demonstration that it is
impractical and infeasible for lots to front on local streets. Where such a
Design & Improvement Standards
27
waiver is granted, a turnaround driveway must be provided. Shared driveways
must be provided for contiguous lots on the collector street where feasible.
b. One driveway curb cut will be permitted per residential lot on a local street,
unless the distance between them is greater than 50 feet and approval has
been granted by the Planning Director and the Town Engineer. Only one
driveway curb cut will be permitted per residential lot on a collector street.
c. Every lot shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles as well as
for those needing access to the property for its intended use.
d. The placement of units in residential developments shall take into
consideration topography, privacy, building height, orientation, drainage, and
aesthetics. Where appropriate, these items shall be designed in accordance
with the Public Improvement Specifications manual.
e. When open space is required in a subdivision, a concept meeting with the
Commission is encouraged so that the location of open space may be agreed
upon early in the application process.
B.5. Commercial and Industrial Development Design
Commercial and industrial development shall be designed according to the same
principles governing the design of residential developments, namely, buildings
shall be located according to topography, with environmentally sensitive areas
avoided to the maximum extent practicable; factors such as drainage, noise, odor,
and surrounding land uses considered in siting buildings; sufficient access shall be
provided, and such access shall conform to applicable access management
regulations; and adverse impacts buffered.
B.6. Circulation System Design
a. The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and orderly
movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed the needs of the present and
future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect
natural features and topography, and to present an attractive streetscape.
Local streets shall be designed to connect to collector streets in accordance
with the street hierarchy system.
b. Proposed streets and sidewalks shall be in harmony with existing or proposed
arterial and collector streets, as shown on the Town Plan of Development,
especially with regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares.
c. The pedestrian system shall be located as required for safety. Sidewalks shall
generally be placed parallel to the street, with exceptions permitted to
preserve natural features. Sidewalks shall generally be placed on both sides of
new streets, except where waived by the Commission. The Commission may
require sidewalks on existing street frontage, depending upon pedestrian
circulation patterns and existing site conditions.
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
28
B.7. Landscape Design
a. Reasonable landscaping should be provided at subdivision entrances, along
streets (but not within street rights-of-way, and in public areas. The type and
amount of landscaping shall be suited to the development.
b. The plant or other landscaping material that best serves the intended function
shall be selected. Landscaping materials shall be appropriate for the local
environment, soil conditions, and availability of water. Provisions shall be
made for long-term maintenance of landscaping.
C. Specific Design Requirements
The following design guidelines should be used in conjunction with the design
requirements contained in the Public Improvement Specifications manual where
applicable and appropriate.
C.1. Open Space and Recreation
C.1.a. Purpose.
It is the policy of the Town of South Windsor to preserve open space in
accordance with the requirements set forth herein. These open space and
recreation requirements have been prepared from a regional perspective in an
effort to preserve wildlife habitat, flora and fauna, while preserving for the
citizens of the region an area in which to enjoy nature, with an opportunity to
walk, jog, cross country ski, bicycle, picnic, fish, wade, sit or otherwise spend
time in a natural setting.
In addition to these passive activities these requirements recognize the importance
of areas which may be used for active recreational activities which include
competitive sports; and the importance of the Town's agricultural areas, which the
Town strives to preserve, in an effort to provide locally grown fruits and
vegetables, dairy products, trees, shrubbery and similar products.
The Open Space and Recreation requirements outlined herein are based on the
Town Plan of Conservation and Development, the Agricultural Land Preservation
Master Plan, the Open Space Master Plan, and the Recreation Master Plan.
together with areas which can unite or link important open space areas. These
"linkages" are formed by joining undeveloped and undevelopable land areas,
including existing open spaces, areas with developmental restrictions, such as
streams, wetlands and severe slopes and through the identification and plotting of
existing trails. Many of these areas are identified on maps contained within each
Master Plan.
C.1.b. Mandatory Open Space Subdivisions.
In order to meet the goals and objectives for open space preservation contained in
the Subdivision and Zoning Regulations as well as the documents noted above, or
Design & Improvement Standards
29
when a site proposed for subdivision has been identified in a Master Plan noted
above as a desirable site for open space and/or recreation, the Commission may
require an Open Space Subdivision rather than a conventional subdivision. All
applicants are strongly encouraged to appear before the Commission for a preapplication
discussion of their proposed open space plan, prior to the receipt of the
complete application. Requests for a pre-application discussion shall be made in
writing to the Commission and shall be placed on the earliest possible agenda of
the Commission.
Development applications which include areas contained within one of the abovereferenced
Master Plans shall, where possible, set aside those areas for
preservation. As provided within the Subdivision Regulations, Section C.1.c.(1),
an area equal to twenty percent (20%) of the combined acreage of the lots shall be
preserved for open space, and as outlined within Section 10.3 of the Zoning
Regulations, Open space subdivision, fifty percent (50%) of the site shall be
preserved for open space. Where applications for development contain areas
included within a Master Plan, the required preservation of open space shall
closely correspond with those areas outlined within the Master Plan.
All subdivision applications which contain a total of 10 acres or more shall be
designed in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.3 of the Zoning
Regulations, Open Space Subdivision, where 50% or more of the total area to be
subdivided is contained within an above-referenced Master Plan. The Commission
may waive this requirement where site conditions clearly prevent a reduction in
the minimum lot size.
All subdivision applications which contain a total of 10 acres or more shall be
designed in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.3 of the Zoning
Regulations, Open Space Subdivision, where 25% or more of the total area to be
subdivided is identified as desirable agricultural land in a Master Plan. A
minimum of 50% of the required open space shall be within the desirable
agricultural land area. The Commission may waive this requirement where site
conditions clearly prevent a reduction in the minimum lot size.
C.1.c. Minimum Requirements
(1) Conventional Subdivision. In a subdivision of six (6) or more lots,
twenty percent (20%) of the tract proposed for subdivision shall be
preserved as open space. The Commission may reduce this requirement
where the proposed lot size is 100% larger than the minimum lot size
required under Section 10 of the Zoning Regulations. Any land reserved
for surface water runoff, such as detention basins, regulated wetlands,
waterbodies, brooks and streams, shall not be considered as meeting the
requirements of open space, except when in the judgment of the
Commission such land is deemed to be of benefit to the recreation areas
in town and/or upstream or downstream watersheds. In no case shall
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
30
more than one-half of said land be considered for open space
requirements.
(2) Open Space Subdivision. In accordance with the provisions of Section
10.3 of the South Windsor Zoning Regulations, Open Space
Subdivisions may be allowed by Special Exception. Fifty percent (50%)
of the tract proposed for subdivision shall be preserved as open space. In
addition to the requirements contained within these regulations, all open
space subdivisions must conform to the requirements of section 10.3.
(3) All Subdivisions
(a) Location of open space parcels. The location of the open space shall
be designed in accordance with one or more of the following factors
as appropriate to the site, (some do conflict with others).
i. Where new roads are proposed, open space is located so as to
create a buffer between the existing Town/State road(s) and the
proposed lots.
ii. The open space is designed as a buffer between the proposed
subdivision and abutting properties.
iii. The open space is located to preserve such natural features as
scenic vistas, ridge tops, significant tree groves, waterfalls and
environmentally scenic areas.
iv. The open space is located in areas to preserve significant man
made features such as stone walls, canals or historic structures.
v. The open space is located so as to preserve primary and
secondary agricultural lands.
vi. The open space is located in areas which connect existing open
space or areas with the greatest potential for future open space
and facilitates recreational and green space corridors and/or
trails.
vii. The open space extends beyond the wetland boundary side of a
stream or watercourse. Where a proposed subdivision includes
an area containing a significant stream or a stream linkage, the
applicant shall, where possible, preserve as open space the
stream and an area located within two hundred feet from either
side of the centerline of the stream. Streams under this section
include, but are not limited to: the Podunk River; Plum Gulley
Brook; Stoughton Brook; Bancroft Brook. This preservation
area will be required as part of the fifty percent (50%) open
space subdivision, or twenty percent (20%) conventional
subdivision requirement.
viii. The open space is suitable for public active recreational use.
Design & Improvement Standards
31
(b) All open space shall abut or have direct access to a street through a
right-of-way dedicated to public use. The right-of-way shall not be
included in the required open space area, shall be at least fifty (50)
feet wide and shall be suitable for foot traffic. In acceptable
circumstances the Commission may reduce or waive this
requirement. Private open space land that is to be used by selected
or limited groups for recreation or other similar purposes shall have
access as required above, but such access shall remain part of the
private land
(c) Development applications shall preserve a location for the parking
of vehicles within areas that can provide public access to existing
and proposed open space, particularly those areas which provide
access to new and existing trails and recreational areas. The
preservation of these areas will be required as part of the fifty
percent (50%) open space subdivision, or twenty percent (20%)
conventional subdivision requirement. The Commission may reduce
the open space requirement, and thereby permit an equal increase in
density, where an application proposes the construction of parking
areas, provided the value of the construction is equivalent to the
value of the land and the additional lots obtained as a result of open
space reduction.
(d) The Commission may permit a reduction in the fifty percent (50%)
open space subdivision, or twenty percent (20%) conventional
subdivision open space requirement and thereby permit an equal
increase in density, where the application proposes to construct
public facilities, such as ball fields, and other recreational facilities,
provided the value of the construction is equivalent to the value of
the land and the additional lots obtained as a result of open space
reduction.
(e) When a property line of a subdivision abuts existing open space, the
Commission may require the new open space lines to form a
continuation of the existing area to provide a single, large, unified
area.
(f) Monuments are required at all corners and angles of Town open
space, except where land characteristics cannot accept the
monuments.
(g) Any security as outlined in Chapter 3, Section E for the completion
of public utilities and improvements shall also be available for
completion of public or private open space requirements in the event
of a default of performance by the subdivider or his successor.
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
32
C.1.d. Fee in Lieu of Open Space
(1) When required. When conditions such as subdivision size, population
density, existing municipal facilities, topography, or other site- or
development-specific characteristics are such that on-site open space is
not desirable, the Commission may require the applicant to provide a fee
in lieu of open space or a combination of land and fee.
(2) Amount. Such payment or combination of payment and the fair market
value of land transferred shall be equal to no more than ten percent of the
fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the
subdivision. The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser
jointly selected by the Commission and the applicant, with the cost to be
borne by the applicant.
(3) Payment. A fraction of such payment the numerator of which is one and
the denominator of which is the number of approved parcels in the
subdivision shall be made at the time of the sale of each approved parcel
of land in the subdivision and placed in a fund which shall be used for
the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring additional land for
open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes.
C.1.e. Exceptions.
The open space requirements of this section shall not apply if:
(1) the subdivision contains less than six (6) lots, or
(2) the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in CGS
Section 8-39a, equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the total
housing to be constructed in such subdivision.
C.1.f. Improvement of Open Space Parcels
Land to be used as public or private open space shall be left in a condition for the
purpose intended. Where directed by the Commission, undesirable growth and
debris shall be removed by the developer; and open space to be used for recreation
shall be graded to dispose of surface water and shall be seeded. In general,
wooded and brook areas shall be left natural.
(1) Developed open space. The Commission may require the installation of
landscaping and/or recreational facilities, taking into consideration:
(a) The character of the open space land;
(b) The estimated age and the recreational needs of persons likely to
reside in the development;
(c) Proximity, nature, and excess capacity of existing municipal
recreational facilities;
(d) The cost of the recreational facilities;
Design & Improvement Standards
33
(e) Separation/delineation of open space from surrounding land uses;
and
(f) Reports of other Town Commissions or departments regarding the
proposed improvements.
Sports field lighting and/or audio speakers are not permitted on
subdivision open space acquired under these regulations.
The Commission may at their discretion require a site improvement plan
as part of the final plans on public open space land that is reserved for
recreation. These plans shall be subject to the approval of the
Commission.
(2) Undeveloped open space. As a general principle, undeveloped open
space should be left in its natural state. The Commission may require
naturalized planting of open space that has been used for agriculture or
disturbed in other ways and is not in a suitable natural condition. The
Commission may require certain improvements such as the cutting of
trails for walking or jogging, or the provision of picnic areas, etc. In
addition, the Commission may require a developer to make other
improvements, such as removing debris and dead or diseased trees,
thinning trees or other vegetation to encourage more desirable growth,
repairing or replacing deteriorating/dysfunctional drainage
features/structures, etc. Any such improvements shall be included in an
open space improvement site plan and approved by the Commission.
C.1.g. Exceptions to the Standards
The Commission may permit minor deviations from open space
standards when it can be determined that: a) the objectives underlying
these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and/or b)
because of peculiarities in the tract of land or the facilities proposed, it
would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards.
C.1.h. Open Space Ownership
The type of ownership of land dedicated for open space purposes shall be
selected by the owner, developer, or subdivider, subject to the approval
of the Commission, with the Town having firstright of refusal on all
open space. Type of ownership may include, but is not necessarily
limited to, the following:
(1) The Town, subject to acceptance by the Town Council;
(2) Quasi-public land preservation organizations (for example, a land
trust), subject to their acceptance; or
(3) Homeowner associations or organizations.
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
34
C.1.i. Homeowners Association
If the open space is owned and maintained by a homeowners association,
the developer shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions that
will govern the association, to be submitted with the application. The
provisions shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
(1) The homeowners association must be established before the homes
are sold;
(2) Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive buyer;
(3) The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a period
of years;
(4) The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local
taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities;
(5) Homeowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost of
maintenance, and the assessment levied by the association can
become a lien on the property if allowed in the master deed
establishing the homeowners association; and
(6) The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
(7) The association shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of the
open space except:
(a) the open space may be donated to the Town of South Windsor,
which shall have first right of refusal; or
(b) the open space may be donated to a quasi-public land
preservation organization.
C.1.j. Deed Restrictions
Any land dedicated for open space purposes shall contain appropriate
covenants and deed restrictions (approved by the Town Attorney for
Town-dedicated property) ensuring that:
(1) The open space area will not be further subdivided in the future;
(2) The use of the open space will continue in perpetuity for the purpose
specified;
(3) Appropriate provisions will be made for the maintenance of the
open space; and
(4) Open space shall not be converted into a commercial for-profit
enterprise.
Design & Improvement Standards
35
(5) Rights of public access to the open space are provided when
appropriate.
C.1.k. Maintenance of Open Space Areas
The person or entity identified in Section C.1.g as having the right of
ownership or control over the open space shall be responsible for its
continuing upkeep and proper maintenance.
C.2. Landscaping Standards
a. Purpose
(1) Landscaping shall be provided as part of subdivision design along
streets, at subdivision entrances and within open space, And other areas
if appropriate. It shall be conceived in a total pattern or theme throughout
the site, integrating the various elements of site design, preserving and
enhancing the particular identity of the site, and creating a pleasing site
character.
(2) Landscaping may include plant materials such as trees, shrubs, ground
covers, perennials and annuals, and other materials such as rocks, water,
sculptures, walls, fences, paving material, and street furniture.
(3) Where a landscaping pattern/theme has been previously approved in a
neighborhood, new subdivision lots should generally adhere to the
established theme.
b. Landscape Plan
(1) A landscape plan prepared by a registered landscape architect shall be
submitted with each subdivision application which contains five (5) or
more lots and/or new road(s). The plan shall identify the existing tree
line plus existing mature trees, and proposed trees, shrubs and ground
covers; natural features such as rock outcroppings; and other landscaping
elements. The plan shall show where they are or will be located, and
planting and/or construction details. Where existing plantings are to be
retained, the applicant shall include in the plans proposed methods of
protecting them during construction.
(2) A waiver to this provision may be granted by the Commission where it is
demonstrated that subdivision landscaping is not practical or feasible, or
where existing site vegetation to be preserved is sufficient to preclude
the need for additional landscaping. If a waiver is granted, the
subdivision plan must contain provisions for preservation of existing
vegetation (where appropriate), in accordance with Site Protection and
General Planting Requirements below.
c. Street Trees
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
36
(1) Location. Shade trees shall be installed on both sides of all streets in
accordance with the approved landscape plan, per the specifications in
the Public Improvement Specifications manual. Trees shall be either
massed or spaced evenly along the street or both, and shall be located
within a street trees easement located adjacent to the street R.O.W.,
coordinated with utilities companies to ensure no trees are planted above
utility lines.
(2) Street trees easement. All street trees will be located within an easement
dedicated to the Town of South Windsor, located directly adjacent to the
street right-of-way. Said easement will prohibit removal of street trees
without the express written consent of the Public Works Director of the
Town. Maintenance of street trees will be the responsibility of the lot
owner.
(3) Street trees waiver. Where topography or site conditions are not suitable
for street trees, street trees may be eliminated or may not be designed in
strict accordance with the above standards, at the Commission's
discretion.
d. Site Protection and General Planting Requirements
(1) Topsoil preservation. Topsoil shall be redistributed on all regraded
surfaces to provide at least 4 inches of even cover to all disturbed areas
of the development and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting in
accordance with the conservation plan (Section 3.G).
(2) Removal of debris. All stumps and other tree parts, litter, brush, weeds,
excess or scrap building materials or other debris shall be removed from
the site and disposed of in accordance with the law. No tree stumps, or
portions of tree trunks or limbs shall be buried anywhere in the
development without prior approval from the Town Engineer and
Wetlands Enforcement Officer; and in no instance shall they be buried in
regulated wetlands and/or areas of high groundwater. All dead or dying
trees, standing or fallen, shall be removed from all areas except open
space. If trees and limbs are reduced to chips, they may be used as mulch
in landscaped areas, subject to approval by the Town Engineer and
Wetlands Enforcement Officer.
(3) Protection of existing plantings. Maximum effort should be made to save
existing vegetation, and relocation of desirable trees on-site is
particularly encouraged. No material or temporary soil deposits shall be
placed within four (4) feet of shrubs or within the drip line of trees
designated on the landscape plan to be retained (unless it can be
demonstrated that the drip line area is excessive for specific tree species).
Protective barriers or tree wells shall be installed around each plant
and/or group of plants that are to remain on the site. Barriers shall not be
supported by the plants they are protecting, but shall be self-supporting.
They shall be a minimum of four (4) feet high and constructed of a
Design & Improvement Standards
37
durable material that will last until construction is completed. Snow
fences are an example of acceptable barriers.
(4) Slope plantings. Landscaping of all cuts and fills and/or terraces shall be
sufficient to prevent erosion, and all roadway slopes steeper than 1 foot
vertically to 3 feet horizontally (1:3 ratio) shall be planted with ground
cover appropriate for the purpose and for soil conditions, water
availability, and environment.
(5) Additional landscaping. In residential subdivisions, besides the screening
and street trees required, additional plantings or landscaping elements
may be required throughout the subdivision where necessary for privacy
or other reasons in accordance with the landscape plan approved by the
Commission and taking into consideration cost constraints (for example,
where lots have back yards fronting on a street, the Commission may
require screening between the street and the back yard). In nonresidential
subdivisions, all disturbed areas of the site not occupied by buildings and
other impervious surfaces shall be landscaped by the planting of grass or
other ground cover, shrubs, and trees as part of the landscape plan
approved by the Commission.
(6) Planting specifications. Deciduous trees shall have at least a 2-1/2 inch
caliper at planting. Size of evergreens and shrubs shall be allowed to
vary depending on setting and type of tree/shrub. All plant materials
shall be of nursery stock quality; and all trees, shrubs, and ground covers
shall be planted according to accepted horticultural standards. Dead and
dying plants shall be replaced by the developer during the following
planting season.
(7) Plant species. The plant species selected should be hardy for this area,
and appropriate in terms of function and size.
e. Buffers
Buffers are required wherever a new subdivision abuts a nonresidential
zone, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4 of the zoning
regulations.
C.3. Streets
a. General
(1) The arrangement of streets shall be in harmony with the circulation plan
of the Town Plan of Development and any specific plans for the area of
the subdivision.
(2) For streets not shown on the Town Plan, the arrangement shall provide
for the appropriate and reasonable provision of new streets or other
access or the extension of existing streets.
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
38
(3) Residential streets shall be arranged so as to discourage through traffic
and provide for maximum privacy and safety.
(4) Street design details shall conform with the requirements and
specifications of the Public Improvement Specifications manual.
(5) Any street that is to be constructed in phases must make provisions for a
temporary cul-de-sac at the location where it is to terminate. This
provision may be waived only where the street extension is to occur
immediately following completion of the previous section.
(6) Where a subdivision abuts an existing Town street with no defined street
line, a proposed street line shall be shown on plans. Upon acceptance by
the Town Council, the street line shall be monumented by the subdivider
in accordance with the monumentation standards in the Public
Improvement Specifications manual. The newly established street line
shall provide a right-of-way width equal to one-half of the required total
width, in accordance with the street's classification, along the subdivision
property boundary.
Where a subdivision abuts an existing Town street with inadequate rightof-
way width, the subdivider shall provide additional right-of-way width
equal to one-half of the required R.O.W. width, in accordance with the
street's classification, along the subdivision property boundary.
Right-of-way width shall be measured as follows:
(a) Where the horizontal geometry of the existing street meets Town
specifications, and the existing pavement is centered within the
existing right-of-way, the right-of-way width shall be measured
from the centerline of the existing pavement.
(b) Where the existing pavement is offset within the existing right-ofway,
and/or where the horizontal geometry of the existing street
fails to meet Town standards, a new street centerline that meets
Town standards shall be established. The subdivision plan shall
demonstrate that the new centerline will meet Town standards when
extended past the boundaries of the proposed subdivision. The rightof-
way width to be provided to the Town will be measured from the
new street centerline.
(7) The required right-of-way shall be deeded to the Town in accordance
with the procedures for acceptance of land/improvements contained
elsewhere in these regulations.
b. Street Hierarchy
(1) Streets shall be classified in a street hierarchy system with design
tailored to function.
Design & Improvement Standards
39
Exhibit l: Residential
Street Hierarchy
1. Local Street: Lowest order of streets. Provides frontage for access to lots, and
carries traffic having destination or origin on the street itself. All, or the maximum
number of housing units, shall front on this class of street. An east-to-west
orientation is considered desirable to allow for maximum solar lot configuration.
Expected traffic volume is less than l,000 vehicles per day.
2. Minor Collector: Provides frontage for access to lots that are unable to access local
streets, and carries traffic of adjoining local streets. Designed to carry somewhat
higher traffic volumes with traffic limited to motorists having origin or destination
within the immediate neighborhood. May interconnect adjoining neighborhoods or
subdivisions but should not carry regional through traffic. Expected traffic volumes
generally range between 1,000 and 3,000 vehicles per day.
3. Major Collector: Serves both a traffic movement function and a limited land access
function. A significant portion of trips are through trips, with both origin and
destination outside the neighborhood. Expected traffic volumes generally range
between 3,000 and 10,000 vehicles per day.
4. Arterial: Primary function is to move large volumes of traffic quickly. Traffic
volumes on these roads generally exceed 10,000 vehicles per day.
(2) The street hierarchy system shall be defined by road function and
average daily traffic (ADT), calculated by trip generation rates prepared
by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. Trip generation rates from
other sources may be used if the applicant demonstrates that these
sources better reflect local conditions.
(3) Each residential street shall be classified and designed for its entire
length to meet the standards for one of the street types defined in Exhibit
l.
(4) The applicant shall demonstrate to the Commissions' satisfaction that
the distribution of traffic to the proposed street system will not exceed
the ADT thresholds indicated in Exhibit l for any proposed street types.
c. Cul-de-Sac (Dead End) Streets
(1) Residential Cul-de-Sac Streets
Cul-de-sac streets in all residential zones shall generally not exceed 600
feet in length, measured from the right-of-way line of the intersection
street to the centerpoint of the cul-de-sac radius along the street
centerline. The Commission may grant a waiver of the length
requirement of this section, in residential zones only, if the Commission
deems it desirable due to adverse topographic or environmental
conditions, difficult site configuration, if such street is likely to be
extended in the future to another outlet, if no potential outlet would be
available to serve the residential zone area, or if such extension serves
the purposes of access management, subject to the following conditions:
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
40
(a) In no case shall a dead end street exceed 1,500 feet in length.
(b) If a potential outlet is available, the Commission shall conclude that
the conceptual routing of such outlet appears reasonable.
(c) If no potential outlet is available, the Commission shall determine
that the subject property cannot be reasonably served by any other
public street (existing or future) due to site constraints
(environmental or topographic), accepted engineering standards,
and/or prohibitive or excessive cost.
(d) The Commission shall determine that the proposed extension
conforms to the goals and objectives of access management.
(e) The Commission shall conclude that the proposed street extension
will function as an residential local street, rather than a collector or
arterial highway.
(f) Underground utilities must be provided.
(g) Sidewalks are required on both sides of the street.
Said waiver may be considered and acted upon at the request of the
subdivider in advance of a formal subdivision application. In such cases,
a conceptual layout of the proposed street extension shall be submitted
with the written waiver request, accompanied by a narrative statement
explaining the proposal and why a waiver is consistent with the
requirements of this section.
(2) Industrial Cul-de-Sac Streets
Cul-de-sac streets in all industrial zones shall generally not exceed 1500
feet in length, measured per Section C.3.c(l) above. The Commission
may grant a waiver of the length requirement of this section, in industrial
zones only, if the Commission deems it desirable due to adverse
topographic or environmental conditions, difficult site configuration, if
such street is likely to be extended in the future to another outlet, if no
potential outlet would be available to serve the industrial zone area, or if
such extension serves the purposes of access management, subject to the
following conditions:
(a) In no case shall a dead end street exceed 2,500 feet in length.
(b) If a potential outlet is available, the Commission shall conclude that
the conceptual routing of such outlet appears reasonable.
(c) If no potential outlet is available, the Commission shall determine
that the subject property cannot be reasonably served by any other
public street (existing or future) due to site constraints
(environmental or topographic), accepted engineering standards,
and/or prohibitive or excessive cost.
Design & Improvement Standards
41
(d) The Commission shall determine that the proposed extension
conforms to the goals and objectives of access management.
(e) The Commission shall conclude that the proposed street extension
will function as an industrial local street, rather than a collector or
arterial highway.
(f) Underground utilities must be provided.
Said waiver may be considered and acted upon at the request of the
subdivider in advance of a formal subdivision application. In such cases,
a conceptual layout of the proposed street extension shall be submitted
with the written waiver request, accompanied by a narrative statement
explaining the proposal and why a waiver is consistent with the
requirements of this section.
Any such waiver shall be conditional upon the requirement that
individual lot development within the industrial subdivision shall, to the
extent possible, provide for emergency vehicle access in the event of a
street blockage (e.g. fallen tree, ruptured pipe, etc.). This may include an
access driveway at each end of the street frontage providing an
uninterrupted -on-site vehicle by-pass to the blockage. Such driveways
can and should be shared with abutting lots where feasible.
d. Future Street Stubs
(1) Street stubs shall be provided where, in the opinion of the Commission,
they are necessary for a coordinated street system connecting a
subdivision with adjoining land that may be developed in the future.
These street stubs shall not require pavement.

finished grading and other site work is not completed, the Town
Town of South Windsor Subdivision Regulations
46
Engineer shall determine the amount of a cash bond to insure final
grading and site work. The cash bond shall be submitted to the
Engineering Department prior to issuance of a permanent certificate of
occupancy.
(c) No permanent certificate of occupancy will be issued unless a roadway
base and binder course of bituminous concrete, constructed in
accordance with these regulations, has been completed to the satisfaction
of the Town Engineer.
E. Off-Tract Improvements
1. Purpose
This section is intended to ensure that reasonable off-tract improvements
necessitated by a new development are included with approved subdivision plans.
2. Types of Improvements That May Be Required
a. As a condition of final subdivision approval, the Commission may
require an applicant to provide reasonable and necessary traffic and
pedestrian circulation improvement; sewerage; drainage facilities and
other improvements including land and easements, located off-tract of
the property limits of the subdivision but necessitated or required by the
development. 'Necessary' improvements are those clearly and
substantially related to the subject development. The Commission shall
indicate in its approval the basis of the required improvements.
b. Streets. Street improvements may include (but are not limited to):
alignment, channelization, barriers, new or improved traffic
signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility improvements not
covered elsewhere, the construction or reconstruction of new or existing
streets, and other associated street or traffic improvements.
Off-tract streets from which the subdivision is directly accessed shall be
of such condition that safe, adequate access to the subdivision is
provided. The subdivider may be required to correct deficiencies such as
horizontal/vertical alignment (inadequate sight line), inadequate
drainage, substandard width, substandard pavement condition, where
such conditions directly affect the safety of the proposed subdivision.
c. Drainage. If the existing system functions inadequately or does not have
adequate capacity to accommodate the applicant's stormwater runoff
given existing and reasonably anticipated peak-hour flows, drainage
improvements may include (but are not limited to): installation,
relocation, or replacement of storm drains, culverts, catch basins,
manholes, riprap, improved drainage ditches and appurtenances, and
relocation or replacement of other storm drainage facilities or
appurtenances.

SECTION I - TITLE AND AUTHORITY
1.1 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands, Watercourses, and
Conservation Regulations of the Town of South Windsor".
1.2 These regulations have been prepared by the Inland Wetlands
Agency/Conservation Commission of the Town of South Windsor in accordance
with the provisions of An Act Concerning Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
(Public Act 155,1972, amended, P.A. 571, 1973), codified as sections 22a-36 to
45 inclusive of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended, hereinafter referred
to as "The Act" together with an act concerning establishment of municipal
conservation commissions (P.A. 310, 1961; P.A. 490 S.7, 1963; P.A. 284 S. 1,
1969; P.A. 872 S.403, 1971; P.A. 73-293 and P.A. 79-84), as amended, codified
as section 7-131a to 13lq inclusive of the Connecticut General Statutes, as
amended, herein referred to as "The Act". The Agency was authorized by the
Town Council of the Town of South Windsor in accordance with a resolution
adopted June 4, 1973. The Conservation Commission was authorized by the
Town Council of South Windsor in accordance with a resolution adopted, and
later revised 2-4-80 as Ordinance No. 99, sections 9-22 through 9-27 of The Code
of the Town of South Windsor.
1.3 Pursuant to The Act, the Inland Wetlands Agency/Conservation Commission of
the Town of South Windsor has the option of granting a permit, granting a permit
with conditions or limitations, or denying a permit for all uses and activities on
inland wetlands and watercourses; and the development, conservation,
supervision and regulation of natural resources within the Town of South
Windsor. The Conservation Commission also shall oversee planning and
maintenance of the South Windsor Wildlife Sanctuary and, in accordance with
Connecticut General Statutes 131-b shall (1)conduct research into the utilization
and possible utilization of land areas of the municipality. (2) keep an index of all
open areas, publicly or privately owned, including open marshlands, swamps and
other wetlands, for the purpose of obtaining information on the proper use of such
areas. and (3) keep records of its meetings and activities and make an annual
report to the municipality in the manner required of other municipal agencies.
And it may, with the approval of the municipal legislative body, acquire land and
easements in the name of the municipality.
1.4 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an
indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the
citizens of the state have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an
interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and
underground water; hydrological stability; control of flooding and erosion;
recharging and purification of groundwater; and existence of many forms of
animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been
- 1 -
destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of
the deposit, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water
flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled,
polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity
has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the
environment and ecology of the State of Connecticut and has and will continue to
imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological,
scenic, historic, and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens
now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and
watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses,
disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health,
welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these
regulations (see section 22a-36 of the Connecticut General Statutes as amended)
to protect the citizens of the town by making provisions for the protection,
preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by
minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water
quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local
authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss
of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the

State Statutes, as amended, "An Act Concerning Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control", as aforesaid, and defined below with a suggestion for an acceptable
format. See Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook for further details.
1. Definition of Plan
An erosion and sediment control plan is a document, which explains and
illustrates the measures, which will be taken to control erosion and
sediment problems on construction sites. The plan has a written portion
- 19 -
known as a narrative and an illustrative portion known as a map or site
plan. A plan is defined in PA 83-388 of 1983 as follows:
"Soil erosion and sediment control plan" means a scheme that minimizes
soil erosion and sedimentation and includes but is not limited to a map and
narrative. The map shall show topography, cleared and graded areas,
proposed area alterations and the location of and detailed information
concerning erosion and sediment measures and facilities. The narrative
shall describe the project, the schedule of major activities on the land, the
application of conservation practices, design criteria, construction details
and the maintenance program for any erosion and sediment control
facilities that are installed;
2. Plan Format
The soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be an integral part of the
overall site plan. However, it needs to be consolidated so it can be
separated from the site plan for review and certification.
To facilitate plan review, certification and implementation, and the
construction inspection process, the following format is suggested:
a. The information needed for construction should be on the construction
drawings and not in the design calculations or background
information.
b. The construction drawings should all be the same size sheets.
c. The soil erosion and sediment control measures construction drawings
should be a part of the overall construction drawings for the project.
d. The construction details for measures should be shown on a separate
sheet from the plan view sheets.
e. The stages of development, sequence of major operations on the land
and maintenance program during construction are in the narrative
portion of the plan but also should be on the construction drawings.
f. General information about the project and design calculations should
be in the narrative portion with the exception of a small simple plan.
g. The design calculations should be in the narrative separate from the
construction drawings. Design calculations are normally not needed
for inspection, but design calculations need to be available in case
revisions are necessary during construction.
- 20 -
h. The background information should be in the narrative separate from
the construction drawings.
i. Additional information as may be required by the Agency.
8.2 An applicant may request a waiver to the Class A-2 map requirement. This
request shall be submitted in writing to the Agency, and shall be acted on by the
Agency, prior to submission of an application.
8.3 The Agency may require the applicant to provide information from the DEP
Natural Diversity Data Base to determine if any state listed endangered species
exist on the project site.
8.4 The Agency may allow for a waiver to the buildable area; as defined in section
2.lc, in very unusual situations with documentation from a soil scientist,
geologist, biologist, ecologist, or other qualified individual. A request for a
waiver shall be submitted in writing to the Agency, and shall be acted on by the
Agency, prior to submission of an application. Supportive documentation to
justify the request must be provided by the applicant.
8.5 The Minimal Impact Applications shall include the following information in
writing, and shall be on a form provided by the Agency and available from the
Planning Department, Town of South Windsor.
A. The applicant's name, home and work addresses, and telephone numbers.
B. The owner's name (if applicant is not the owner of the property), home and
business addresses, telephone numbers, and written consent to the proposed
activity set forth in the application.
C. If applicant is not the owner, state interest in the land.
D. The geographical location of the property which is to be affected by the
proposed activity, including a description of the land in sufficient detail to
allow identification of the property on the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Map including the parcel number as shown on the current Tax Assessor's
Map.
E The purpose and description of all proposed regulated activity(ies) including
amount of disturbance in square feet and types of fill and the time element
involved.
F. Identification of all other permits or approvals that have been issued, applied
for, or required with respect to the proposed activity set forth in the
application. (These may include, but not be limited to, local Planning &
- 21 -
Zoning, Zoning Board of Appeals, D.E.P., F.E.M.A., D.O.T., the Army Corps

relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the
Agency shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances,
including but not limited to:
- 26 -
A. The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or
watercourses.
B. The applicants purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the
proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no
environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses.
C. The relationship between the short term and long term impacts of the
proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance
and enhancement of long term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses.
D. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which
would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to
which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or
restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered
as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited
to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental
damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the
following order of priority; restore, enhance and create productive wetland or

the Agency is not precluded from seeking advice from its own experts on
information already in the record of the public hearing.
- 27 -
11.5 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there
may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which
have less adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Agency shall propose
on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may
investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden
from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present
alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
SECTION XII -- PERMIT DECISIONS
12.1 The Agency, or its duly authorized agent acting pursuant to Section 5.5 of these
regulations, has the option of granting a permit, granting a permit with conditions
or limitations, or denying a permit and shall state upon the record the reason(s)
for its decision.
12.2 Conservation Easement Requirements - If the proposed activity is located within
or is in the proximity to wetlands or watercourses, and the applicant proposes a
conservation easement to mitigate potential impacts upon such wetlands and
watercourses acceptable to the Agency, then the applicant's application, maps and
documents shall include a clear delineation of said conservation easement
including but not limited to the following information:
A. The extent of the area of the proposed project affected by the conservation
easement including precise acreage calculations, boundary dimensions
including bearings and distances, and such other engineering data as may be
required by the Agency;
B. Detailed provisions for the conservation plan to protect the areas within the
conservation easement during all construction phases or periods of other
activity on the proposed site;
C. In addition to showing such conservation easement on all approved maps to
be filed in the Town Land Records, the applicant shall file a conservation
easement containing restrictive covenants using the standard conservation
easement available in the Planning Department. The conservation easement is
a restrictive covenant which shall attach to and run with the land, and it shall
be binding on the landowner and his heirs, successors, and assigns forever.
This conservation easement document shall be recorded on the land records of
the Town prior to the conveyance of title to any portion of the subject
property, prior to the permit being effective, and prior to the issuance of any
certificate of occupancy for any structure on the subject property;
- 28 -
D. Merestones must be installed by the applicant to clearly denote the bounds of
such conservation easement areas on each individual subdivided lot or parcel
(as appropriate to this application) on the maps or plans. Merestones, as
required by the Agency and located according to specifics on the final plan,
shall be verified by the land surveyor who placed them prior to the issuance of
a building permit by the Building Department for each and every subdivided
lot or parcel having a conservation easement.
12.3 Action shall be taken on applications within thirty-five (35) days after the
completion of a public hearing or, in the absence of a public hearing, within sixtyfive
(65) days from the date of receipt of the complete application. The applicant
may consent to one (1) or more extensions of the periods specified in this
subsection for the holding of the hearing and for action on such application,
provided the total extensions of any such period shall not be for longer than the
original period as specified in this subsection, or may withdraw such application.
The failure of the Agency to act within any time period specified in this
subsection, or any extension thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute approval of
the application. An application deemed incomplete by the Agency must either be
withdrawn by the applicant or denied by the Agency.
12.4 Upon the rendering of a final decision, the Agency shall notify the applicant by
certified mail of its decision within fifteen (15) days of the date of the decision.

permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a general circulation in the
Town wherein the regulated area lies. In any case in which such notice is not
published within such fifteen (15) day period, the applicant may provide for the
publication of such notice within ten (10) days thereafter.
12.5 If a bond is required in accordance with section XVI of these regulations, no
permit shall be issued until such bond or surety is provided. None of the
proposed activities under the permit can begin until all changes required by the
Agency have been added to the plans. Furthermore none of the proposed
activities under the permit can begin until all bonding, if required by this permit,
has been posted and final plans, with approval letter reproduced thereon, have
been filed with the Planning Department.
12.6 If the Agency denies the permit, or if it grants a permit with terms, conditions,
limitation or modifications, the applicant may attempt to modify the proposal to
the Agency's satisfaction. The Agency shall determine whether the proposed
modification requires the filing of a new application. The rejection of a modified
or corrected application by the Agency shall be equivalent to the denial of an
application for the purposes of appeal.
12.7 The Agency shall file its decisions with the Town Clerk, Town of South Windsor
and shall also cause the administrative officer designated by the Agency to
maintain a record of all applications.
- 29 -
SECTION XIII -- PERMIT DURATION
13.1 The duration of any permit shall be for five (5) years. The activities approved
shall be completed within one year of commencement and the Agency may
establish a specific time period within which work may be conducted. The
Agency may require that activities be completed in less time and may extend the
time period for completion. All permits shall expire upon the completion of the
acts specified by the approved plans.
13.2 The Agency, at its discretion, may request status reports on an approved site. The
frequency shall be determined by the Agency. This report is to be written by a
licensed Professional Engineer and is to detail the status of activity, compliance to
sedimentation and erosion control plan, and compliance to any regulated activities
approved. Failure to submit a status report, if requested, may result in the
revocation of the permit.
13.3 Permits are issued to specific applicants for conducting regulated activities. The
permittee is responsible for compliance with the permit. Permits may be
transferred with consent of the Agency. The new permit holder will acknowledge
understanding of the permit provisions and agree to comply. Timely action will
be taken by the Agency.
13.4 There will be a thirty five dollar ($35) fee required for an extension of a permit.
This includes a ten dollar ($10) surcharge, assessed by the State, to fund the State
Environmental Quality Fund. In the event the fee is not paid the request for
extension shall be tabled.
13.5 Any application to renew a permit shall be granted upon request of the permit
holder unless the Agency finds that there has been a substantial change in
circumstances which requires a new permit application or an enforcement action
has been undertaken with regard to the regulated activity for which the permit
was issued provided no permit may be valid for more than ten years.
SECTION XIV -- APPEALS
14.1 Appeal of actions of the Agency shall be made in accordance with the provision
of section 22a-43 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended.
14.2 In accordance with CONNECTICUT GENERAL STATUTES 22a-42a-(c)-(2)

periods specified in this subsection for the holding of the hearing and for
action on such petition, provided the total extension of any such period shall
not be for longer than the original period as specified in this subsection, or

sentence, section, part or provision of these regulations shall not affect the
validity of any other part, which can be given effect without such valid part of
