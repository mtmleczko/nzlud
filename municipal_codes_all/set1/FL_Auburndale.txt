PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1963 Code, as supplemented through October 17, 1977, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1963 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the fifth section of Chapter 4 is 4-5. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 6-3 and 6-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-3.1, 6-3.2 and 6-3.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 11 and 12, it will be designated as Chapter 11.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance to keep this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Bruce Canova, City Manager, and Mr. Adrian Gabaldon, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

    If any vacancy shall occur in the offices of mayor or vice mayor, the remaining commissioners shall elect an eligible commissioner to fill the same.

All exterior designated building must comply with requirements under this article. 
(Ord. No. 779, § 5, 12-7-92) 
Sec. 7-31. - Certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  Requirement. No building, structure, improvement, landscape feature, or archaeological site within the City of Auburndale, which has been designated an historic landmark, historic site, or historic district shall be erected, altered, restored, rehabilitated, excavated, moved, or demolished until an application for a certificate of appropriateness regarding any architectural feature, landscape features, or site improvements has been submitted and approved by the historic preservation commission pursuant to the procedures in this article. Architectural features shall include, but shall not be limited to, the architectural style, scale, massing, siting, general design and general arrangement of the exterior of the building or structure, including the type, style and color of roofs, windows, doors and appurtenances. Architectural features shall include, when applicable, interior spaces where interior designation has been given pursuant to section 7-30 of this article. Landscape features and site improvements shall include, but shall not be limited to, site regrading, subsurface alterations, fill deposition, paving, landscaping, walls, fences, courtyards, signs, and exterior lighting. No certificate of appropriateness shall be approved unless the architectural plans for said construction alteration, excavation, restoration, rehabilitation, relocation, or demolition are approved by the historic preservation commission. 
(b)  Guidelines. The historic preservation commission shall adopt the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as the standards by which applications for any certificate of appropriateness are to be measured and evaluated. In adopting these guidelines, it shall be the intent of the commission to promote maintenance, restoration, adaptive reuses appropriate to the property, and compatible contemporary designs which are harmonious with the exterior architectural and landscape features of neighboring buildings, sites and streetscapes. These guidelines shall also serve as criteria for city staff to make decisions regarding applications for standard certificates of appropriateness. From time to time, the commission may adopt additional standards to preserve and protect special features unique to the City of Auburndale. 
(c)  Pre-application conference(s). Before submitting an application for a certificate of appropriateness, an applicant shall confer with the building official to obtain information and guidance before entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys, and other data. A pre-application conference shall be required between the applicant and the commission or its designated representative. The purpose of such conference is to further discuss and clarify conservation objectives and design guidelines in cases that do not conform to established objectives and guidelines. In no case, however, shall any statement or representation made prior to the official application review be binding on the historic preservation commission, or the City of Auburndale. Applications for certificates of appropriateness must be made on forms approved and provided by the historic preservation commission. 
(d)  Application procedures. Each application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by the required fee as listed in the land development regulations fee schedule. The building official shall forward to the commission each application for a permit that would authorize an alteration, new construction, demolition or relocation affecting a designated landmark, a designated landmark site, or a property in a designated historic district. The applicant shall complete an application form provided by the city containing in part the following information: 
(1)  Drawings of the proposed work; 
(2)  Photographs of the existing building or structure and adjacent properties; 
(3)  Information about the building materials to be used. 
    The building official shall determine when an application is complete and may request additional information when such application is determined to be incomplete. 
(e)  Public hearings. The historic preservation commission shall hold a public hearing on each certificate of appropriateness, except those authorized to be reviewed by the building official under subsection (n) of this section, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a completed application in accordance with the public hearing procedures. The historic preservation commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove each application, based on the criteria contained in this section. The commission may vote to defer its decision if adequate information is not available to make a decision, but shall reconsider the application at the earliest opportunity after adequate information is made available. The commission shall act within sixty (60) days after the close of the public hearing. 
(f)  General criteria for granting. 
(1)  In approving or denying applications for certificates of appropriateness for alterations, new construction, demolition, or relocation, the historic preservation commission shall use the following general guidelines: 
a.  The effect of the proposed work on the landmark or the property upon which such work is to be done; 
b.  The relationship between such work and other structures on the landmark site or other property in the historic district; 
c.  The extent to which the historic, architectural, or archaeological significance, architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, materials and color of the landmark or the property will be affected; 
d.  Whether the denial of a certificate of appropriateness would deprive the property owner of reasonable beneficial use of his property; 
e.  Whether the plans may be reasonably carried out by the applicant. 
(2)  The historic preservation commission may establish specific design review criteria for historic districts in addition to the guidelines listed in this section, and may amend such criteria as necessary. The historic commission may also establish specific design review criteria relating to both contributory and noncontributory elements on a landmark or landmark site or within a thematic grouping or an historic district. 
(g)  Additional guidelines for alterations. 
(1)  In approving or denying applications for certificates of appropriateness for alterations, the commission shall also use the following additional guidelines which are based on the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects. 
a.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
b.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
c.  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
d.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site, shall be treated with sensitivity. 
e.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
f.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
g.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any acquisition, protection, stabilization, preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, or reconstruction project. 
(h)  Additional guidelines for new construction. 
(1)  In approving or denying applications for certificates of appropriateness for new construction, the historic preservation commission shall also use the following additional guidelines: 
a.  The height of proposed building shall be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. 
b.  The relationship of the width of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be visually compatible to buildings and places to which it is visually related. 
c.  The relationship of the width of the windows to height of windows in a building shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to which the building is visually related. 
d.  The relationship of solids to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to which it is visually related. 
e.  The relationship of building to open space between it and adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible to the buildings and places to which it is visually related. 
f.  The relationship of entrance and porch projections to sidewalks of a building shall be visually compatible to the buildings and places to which it is visually related. 
g.  The relationship of the materials, texture and color of the facade of a building shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in the buildings to which it is visually related. 
h.  The roof shape of a building shall be visually compatible with the buildings to which it is visually related. 
i.  Appurtenances of a building such as walls, wrought iron, fences, evergreen, landscape masses, building facades, shall, if necessary, form cohesive walls of enclosures along a street, to ensure visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and places to which it is visually related. 
j.  The size of a building, the mass of a building in relation to open spaces, the windows, door openings, porches and balconies shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually related. 
k.  A building shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually related in its directional character, whether this be vertical character, horizontal character or nondirectional character. 
l.  Architectural features shall be incorporated whenever possible to relate the new with the old and to preserve and enhance the characteristics of the district. 
(i)  Additional requirements for demolition. 
(1)  No certificate of appropriateness for demolitions shall be issued by the historic preservation commission until the applicant has demonstrated that no other feasible alternative to demolition can be found. The historic preservation commission may ask interested individuals and organizations for assistance in seeking an alternative to demolition. On all demolition applications, the commission shall study the question of economic hardship for the applicant and shall determine whether the landmark or the property in the historic district can be put to reasonable beneficial use without the approval of the demolition application. In the case of an income-producing building, the commission shall also determine whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from his existing building. The historic preservation commission may ask applicants for additional information to be used in making these determinations including, but not limited to, evidence that the plans for a new building on the site will be implemented. If the applicant fails to establish the lack of a reasonable beneficial use or the lack of a reasonable return, the commission shall deny the demolition application. 
(2)  The historic preservation commission may grant a certificate of appropriateness for demolition even though the designated landmark, designated landmark site, or property within the designated historic district has reasonable beneficial use if: 
a.  The commission determines that the property no longer contributes to an historic district or no longer has significance as an historic, architectural or archaeological landmark. 
b.  The commission determines that the demolition of the designated property is required by a community redevelopment plan or the comprehensive plan. 
(j)  Demolition by neglect. 
(1)  Every owner of a property within a designated historic district shall keep in good repair: 
a.  All of the exterior portions of such building or structures; 
b.  All interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause such buildings or structures to deteriorate or to become damaged or otherwise fall into a state of disrepair; and 
c.  In addition, where the historic resource is an archaeological site, the owner shall be required to maintain his property in such a manner as not to adversely affect the archaeological integrity of the site. 
(2)  In the event the historic preservation commission determines that a property within a designated historic district or a designated historic resource is in the course of being "demolished by neglect", the commission shall notify the owner of record of such preliminary findings, stating reasons therefor. The historic preservation commission shall request a meeting with the owner or the tenant of the building that is not being adequately maintained, and the commission shall present ways to improve the condition of the property. If the owner or tenant fails to take action, the historic preservation commission may recommend to the building official to institute proceedings before the City of Auburndale Code Enforcement Board under authority of applicable laws and regulations. 
(k)  Moving buildings or structures. When an applicant seeks to obtain a certificate of appropriateness for moving a building or structure into, from or within an historic district, the commission shall consider the following: 
(1)  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building or structure contributes to its present setting; 
(2)  Whether there are plans for the site to be vacated, including landscaping; 
(3)  In addition, historic buildings to be relocated to a site within a designated historic district shall be of a compatible size, scale, and design as the properties adjacent to the proposed site; 
(4)  Moving of historic structures from their original location shall be discouraged. 
(l)  Emergency conditions, designated properties. In any case where the building official determines that there are emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a landmark, a landmark site, or a property in an historic district, he may order the remedying of these conditions without the approval of the historic preservation commission or issuance of a required certificate of appropriateness. The building official shall promptly notify the chairman of the historic preservation commission of the action being taken. 
(m)  Emergency actions, nondesignated properties. The city commission may call a special meeting to review a threat to a property that has not yet been designated by the city. The building official has the authority to issue a temporary stop work order for a maximum of fifteen (15) days or until the city commission conducts the emergency meeting or discusses the nondesignated property at a regular city commission session. The city commission may then request that a stop work order be issued by the city manager or his/her designee in order to provide time to negotiate with the property owner to remove the threat to the property. During the stop work order period the city commission may initiate steps to designate the property under the provisions of this article. The city commission may issue a stop work order for up to one hundred twenty (120) days. Within the stop work order period the historic preservation commission shall meet and seek alternatives that may remove the threat to the property, determine if the property should be designated and make a recommendation to the city commission. If a stop work order is requested by an individual or group, the requesting individual or group shall submit a completed designation application form and fee within thirty (30) days from the date the city commission stop work order is issued. If the city commission or historic preservation commission does not receive adequate information and documentation concerning the nondesignated property or if a completed designation application and fee are not filed within the thirty-day period, the city commission may lift the stop work order or allow it to expire without taking further action. 
(n)  Review of certificates of appropriateness for minor alterations. Review and approval of certificates of appropriateness by the building official is authorized for the following alterations and forms of new construction. The building official may forward any such requests to the historic preservation commission for a determination. Within fifteen (15) days of a decision of the building official, any person may appeal in writing to the historic preservation commission any decision of the building official on a request for review of a certificate of appropriateness. The building official shall determine when an action affects a designated historic landmark, designated historic site, or a property in a designated thematic grouping or in a designated historic district. Fees for review of a certificate of appropriateness by the building official shall be the same as those fees established for commission review of certificates of appropriateness.

(1)  Any change of color of exterior paint; 
(2)  Landscaping; 
(3)  Addition of fences; 
(4)  Addition of detached greenhouses and storage sheds less than one hundred (100) square feet in size.

    Any exterior alteration to a building, structure, or site shall be accomplished in strict compliance with the certificate of appropriateness. The building official shall inspect the building to determine compliance with the certificate. Failure to comply with the certificate of appropriateness shall be treated in the same manner as any other building code or building permit violation, including revocation of the permit.

(b)  In any case where work has commenced which requires a certificate of approval under the terms of this article, and where no such certificate has been obtained, a stop work order shall be issued by the building official. The stop work order shall be issued to the property owner, the occupant, or any person, company or corporation commencing work or preparation for work in violation of this article. The stop work order shall remain in full force and effect until a certificate of appropriateness has been obtained. 
(c)  The historic preservation commission may revoke or suspend a certificate of appropriateness upon a determination that a project for which a certificate has been previously granted has violated one (1) or more conditions of its approval. Such determination shall be made at a regular or special meeting of the commission upon at least five (5) days' advance written notice of such meeting to the property owner. The property owner or his/her authorized agent shall have the right to be heard by the commission but a public hearing shall not be required. In the event the project has been completed the historic preservation commission may recommend to the city commission that the historic designation of the structure should be revoked by ordinance.

ARTICLE IV. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 771, §§ 1-21, adopted June 15, 1992, enacted provisions pertaining to sexually oriented businesses. Such provisions did not specify manner of codification; hence, inclusion herein as Art. IV, §§ 15-61-15-81, has been at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 15-61. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Auburndale, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article, have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials. It is not the intent of the city commission to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity as those matters are regulated by Florida law. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 1, 6-15-92) 
Sec. 15-62. - Findings of fact. 
    Based on evidence and testimony presented at public hearing before the city commission and based upon findings incorporated in studies conducted by other city and county governmental units, together with information and reports available to the Auburndale Police Department and the city attorney detailing the potential for criminal activities associated with adult uses and on the findings incorporated in the City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 106 S. Ct. 925 (1986); Young v. American Mini theaters, Inc., 96 S. Ct. 2440 (1976); Bonnell, Inc. v. Board of Adjustments 791 p. 2d 107 (Okl. App. 1989) and considering that public input, research and legal analysis which the city commission believes to be relevant to problems associated with adult uses, the city determines that the enactment of a time, place and manner article regulating and addressing the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment uses is an appropriate exercise of the municipal home rule power in the interests of the health, peace, safety, morals and general welfare of the people of Auburndale, Florida.

Proof that an attempt has been made to mail notice together with proof of posting of notice shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this article have been met, without regard to whether or not the owner actually received such notice. The notice shall: 
(1)  State the nature of the violation with reference to the section of this article defining the violation; 
(2)  Specify the corrective action that must be taken; 
(3)  Specify the date in which the corrective action must be taken;

(5)  State the owner has the right to appeal by filing a written request with city code enforcement special magistrate's office within ten (10) days of posting of the property; 
(6)  State the procedure to request an extension of time from the code enforcement division; and

(b)  If an appeal is filed, enforcement action shall proceed as provided in section 18-74 of this article. 
(c)  If no appeal is filed as provided in section 18-74 of this article and no extension of time is granted by the code enforcement officer, he/she shall, upon the expiration of the notification period, reinspect the lot to determine whether or not the violation has been abated. If the code enforcement officer determines that the lot remains in violation, the code enforcement officer shall submit to the special master a petition for abatement and request abatement of the violation. If the special master grants the petition, the code enforcement officer shall cause such abatement according to the provisions of this article. To accomplish the abatement of the violation, the code enforcement officer is authorized by the city commission to enter upon the lot and to take steps reasonably necessary to effect abatement of the violation. If the special master does not grant the petition, the case shall be set for hearing. 
(d)  If abatement of the violation is effected by the division as provided in subsection (c), the costs to the city of abating the violation on each lot, including without limitation, all vendor, administrative, and operating costs, shall be calculated and assessed against the property as an assessment pursuant to state law and may be collected pursuant to F.S. § 197.3632. 
(e)  The code enforcement officer shall mail a notice of the assessment to the owner at the address on record with the county property appraiser office specifying the violation that was abated, the address or parcel identification number of the lot in which the abatement occurred, the costs of abatement with a statement that if not paid in full or an appeal filed in writing with the city code enforcement special magistrate office at the address provided in the notice within thirty (30) days of the notice being sent, the costs shall be recorded against the owner as an assessment and will create a first lien, equal to a lien for nonpayment of property taxes. Such notice shall specify the date certain in which the costs of abatement must be paid or appeal filed. 
    If an appeal is requested pursuant to this subsection, the only issue to be determined is whether or not the costs in the notice are the actual costs incurred by the city and/or if the notice describes the proper property, and owners.

1.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by the combined waste stream formula in accordance with Rule 62-625.410(6), F.A.C., a removal credit in accordance with Rule 62625.420, F.A.C., or a fundamentally different factor variance in accordance with Rule 62-625.700, F.A.C., at the time the industrial user submits the report required by this subsection, the information requested in f. and g. of this subsection shall pertain to the modified limits. 
2.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by the combined waste stream formula, a removal credit, or a fundamentally different factor variance after the industrial user submits the report required by this subsection, any necessary amendment to the information requested in f. and g. of this subsection shall be submitted by the industrial user to the control authority within sixty (60) days after the modified limit is approved. 
(2)  Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards required by subsection (1)g. above: 
a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction). 
b.  No increment referred to in subsection a. above shall exceed nine (9) months. 
c.  Within fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the control authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority. 
(3)  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in subsections (1)d.-f., above. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with the procedures in Rule 62-625.410(4), F.A.C., this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
(4)  Periodic reports on continued compliance. 
a.  Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, except a non-significant categorical industrial user, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the control authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the control authority in accordance with subsections (6)c., d., and e. below, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported in subsection (1)d. above, except that the control authority shall require more detailed reporting of flows if necessary to comply with the requirements of Chapter 62-625, F.A.C. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the industrial user shall submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the industrial user. The industrial user may request submission of the above reports in months other than June and December if, based on such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, or budget cycles, the alternate dates more accurately represent actual operating conditions. 
b.  The control authority may authorize the industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to waive sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user demonstrates the following through sampling and other technical factors: 
1.  The pollutant in neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or the pollutant is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user; and 
2.  The pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
c.  This authorization of the monitoring waiver is subject to the following conditions and does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as specified in the categorical pretreatment standard: 
1.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism. 
2.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one (1) sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the Department approved method from Rule 62-4.246, F.A.C., with the lowest method detection limit for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
3.  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an authorized representative of industrial user and include the certification statement found in subparagraph 62-625.410(2)(b)2., F.A.C. 
4.  The authorization must be included as a condition in the industrial user's control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver. 
5.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the industrial user's control mechanism by the control authority, the industrial user must certify each report with the following statement: "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsibly for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR [specify applicable national pretreatment standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under paragraph 62-625.600(4)(a), F.A.C." 
6.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present, or is expected to be present, based on changes that occur in the industrial user's operations, the industrial user must immediately notify the control authority and comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (4)a. above or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control authority. 
d.  The control authority may reduce the requirement in paragraph (4)a. above to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the department, where the industrial user meets all of the following conditions: 
1.  The industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not: 
i.  Exceed one one-hundredth (0.01) percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW; or five thousand (5,000) gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches; 
ii.  Exceed one one-hundredth (0.01) percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and 
iii.  Exceed one one-hundredth (0.01) percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were developed for the POTW in accordance with Chapter 62-625.400(3), F.A.C. 
2.  The industrial user has not been in significant noncompliance in the past two (2) years; and 
3.  The industrial user does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary significantly that decreasing the reporting requirements for this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant to paragraph (6)d. below. 
e.  The industrial user must notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of subparagraphs (4)d.1. or (4)d.2. above. Upon notification, the industrial user must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in paragraph (4)a. above. 
f.  Where the control authority has imposed mass limitations on industrial users as provided for by Rule 62-625.410(5), F.A.C., the report required by a. above shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the discharge from the industrial user. 
g.  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with the procedures in Rule 62-625.410(4), F.A.C., the report required by subsection a. above shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by subsection a. above shall include the industrial user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
h.  For any report required under 40 CFR 403.12, including periodic compliance reports, the report shall bear a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a registered engineer, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. The certification statement shall explicitly read "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
i.  The certifications shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, as defined herein. 
(5)  Notice of potential problems, including slug discharges. All categorical and significant non-categorical industrial users shall notify the control authority and POTW immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug discharges and prohibited discharges, as defined by Rule 62-625.400(2), F.A.C. 
(6)  Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance. 
a.  Except in the case of non-significant categorical industrial users, the reports required in subsections (1), (3), and (4) above shall contain results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the control authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the industrial user, except when the department is acting as the control authority. Where the control authority performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the industrial user shall not be required to submit the compliance certification required under subsections (1)f. and (3) above. In addition, where the control authority itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user shall not be required to submit the report. All laboratory analytical reports prepared by the industrial user or the control authority shall comply with Rule 62-160.340, F.A.C. 
b.  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
1.  The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
2.  The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user between the time when the industrial user performs it's initial sampling and the time when the industrial user receives the results of the sampling. 
c.  The reports required in subsections (1), (3) and (4) above shall be based upon data obtained through sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report. These data shall be representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The control authority shall require frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
d.  For all sampling required by this article, grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the sample must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user's file for that facility. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in Chapter 62-160, F.A.C., and DEP-SOP-001/01, multiple grabs collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as follows: 
1.  Samples for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; 
2.  Samples for volatile organics and oil and grease may be composited in the laboratory; and 
3.  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as allowed in the department's approved sampling procedures and laboratory methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. 
e.  Oil and grease samples shall be collected in accordance with paragraph (6)d. above unless the sampling location or point cannot be physically accessed to perform a direct collection of a grab sample. In these instances, the sample shall be pumped from the sampling location or point into the sample container using a peristaltic-type pump. All pump tubing used for sample collection must be new or pre-cleaned and must be changed between sample containers and sample points. The pump tubing shall not be pre-rinsed or flushed with sample prior to collecting the sample. The report of analysis shall indicate that a peristaltic pump was used to collect the oil and grease sample. 
f.  Sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsections (1) and (3) above shall be conducted as follows: 
1.  For industrial users where historical sampling data do not exist, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds. 
2.  For industrial users where historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. 
g.  For the reports required by subsections (4) and (11), the control authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
h.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in subsection (4) or (11) monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate monitoring location more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures required by paragraph (6)d. above, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
i.  All activities related to sampling and analysis shall be subject to the same requirements specified in subsection (1)e.6. above, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(7)  Timing of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date or receipt of the report shall govern. 
(8)  Initial report. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, no later than the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any significant industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in its wastewater which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for those process units in the significant industrial user facility which are subject to such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall indicate whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis; and, if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the significant industrial user and certified to by a qualified professional. 
(9)  Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall promptly notify the control authority in advance of any change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge that may result in pass through or interference at the POTW, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under subsection (12)a. below. 
(10)  Reporting requirements for industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. 
a.  Significant non-categorical industrial users must submit to the control authority once every six (6) months on dates specified by the control authority a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the control authority. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the industrial user must submit documentation required by the control authority to determine the compliance status of the industrial user. 
b.  The reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and are subject to the same requirements specified in paragraphs (6)d. and (6)e. above. All laboratory analytical reports prepared by the industrial user shall comply with Rule 62-160.340, F.A.C. 
(11)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the city may require. 
(12)  Provisions governing hazardous waste. 
a.  The industrial user shall notify the control authority and the department's hazardous waste and pretreatment authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under Chapter 62-730, F.A.C. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user; an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this article shall provide the notification no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under subsection (4), above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (1), (3) and (4) above. 
b.  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection a. above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in Chapter 62-730, F.A.C. Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in Chapter 62-730, F.A.C., requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
c.  In the case of any new department regulations identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the control authority and the department's hazardous waste and pretreatment authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
d.  In the case of any notification made under this subsection, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(13)  Annual certification by non-significant categorical industrial users. An industrial user determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user in accordance with the definitions in this article must annually submit the following certification statement, signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user. The certification must accompany any alternative report required by the control authority: "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards under 40 CFR [specify applicable national pretreatment standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from [month, day, year] to [month, day, year]: 
a.  The facility described as [industrial user name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user as described in section 23-16 of this ordinance; 
b.  The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during this reporting period; and 
c.  The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. This compliance certification is based upon the following information: [documentation of basis to continue exemption]." 
(c)  Wastewater discharge permit appeals. The city shall provide public notice of the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including the user, may petition the city to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within fifteen (15) days of notice of it's issuance. 
(1)  Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. 
(2)  In it's petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal. 
(4)  If the city fails to act within thirty (30) days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review. 
(5)  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the circuit court having jurisdiction within the time period provided by the Florida statutes of limitation. 
(6)  The city may modify a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements; 
b.  To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
c.  A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge; 
d.  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the city's POTW, city personnel, or the receiving waters; 
e.  Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge permit; 
f.  Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting; 
g.  Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13; 
h.  To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater discharge permit; or 
i.  To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or operator. 
(d)  [Mass limitations.] The director may impose mass limitations on users in cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subparagraph (b)(6)a. of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the significant industrial user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis and field activities shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the department of environmental protection's Standard Operating Procedures Manual, DEP-SOP-001/01. 
(e)  [Monitoring facilities.] The city shall require to be provided and operated, at the significant industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the significant industrial user's premises; but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the significant industrial user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the significant industrial user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the city. 
(f)  [Inspection of facilities.] The city shall inspect the facilities of any significant industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The city and/or the department of environmental protection shall have the right to install and operate on the significant industrial user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a significant industrial user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the significant industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city and/or the department of environmental protection will be permitted to enter without delay for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities. If the city has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, the superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit in and for Polk County, Florida. 
(g)  [Wastewater treatment.] Significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the significant industrial user's expense. Detailed plans, showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures, shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the significant industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the significant industrial user's initiation of the changes. 
(h)  [Publication of list of noncompliant users.] The city shall annually publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction served by the POTW a list of the industrial users which were found to be in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements any time during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the industrial user(s) during the same twelve (12) months. For purposes of this provision, an industrial user shall be in significant noncompliance if its violations meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits. A chronic violation shall have occurred when sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed, by any magnitude, a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations of wastewater discharge limits. A TRC violation shall have occurred when thirty-three (33) percent or more of all the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period, equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, Total Oils & Grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard), which the city determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public). 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to prevent or halt such a discharge. 
(5)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance. 
(6)  Failure to provide, within thirty (30) days after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules. 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations, including a violation of best management practices, which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(i)  [Records.] All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards and documentation associated with best management practices shall be made available by the industrial user for inspection and copying by the city, officials of the department of environmental protection, or approval authority upon request. All records shall be maintained a minimum of three (3) years. 
(j)  Industrial monitoring program . 
(1)  The city shall establish an industrial monitoring program to monitor the discharge from significant industrial users to the POTW. This program shall consist of periodic determinations of the user's wastewater discharge characteristics through the analysis of wastewater samples. Monitoring shall be conducted by both the significant industrial user and the city in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth in individual industrial wastewater discharge permits; 
(2)  Laboratory analytical work in support of city monitoring will normally be done by an independent, licensed laboratory; 
(3)  Industrial users discharging abnormal but acceptable high-strength wastes, as identified in section 23-22, may be assessed additional charges for sampling and laboratory analyses up to twice monthly; provided, however, that such costs shall not be assessable if laboratory analyses indicate "normal strength" wastes. Charges for such sampling and laboratory analyses may be assessed daily where such tests indicated unacceptably high-strength wastes detrimental to the POTW; 
(4)  The actual costs for services rendered by the city shall apply to all sampling and laboratory work required in connection with the industrial monitoring program; 
(5)  If an outside laboratory is employed, actual charges incurred will be billed to the industrial customer. All analytical work shall be performed by a Florida-certified laboratory. 
(k)  [Confidentiality of information.] 
(1)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction, unless the significant industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the significant industrial user. 
(2)  When requested by the person furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1379, § 1, adopted February 20, 2012, changed the title of section 23-20.1 from "Administration of wastewater contribution permits; significant industrial users required to obtain; procedures" to "Administration of wastewater discharge permits; significant industrial users required to obtain; procedures." The historical notation has been preserved for reference purposes. 
Sec. 23-21. - Hauled wastewater. 
(a)  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the director, and at such time as are established by the director. Such waste shall be domestic waste and shall not violate section 23-22 of this article or any other requirements established by the city. The director may require septic tank haulers to obtain wastewater permits. 
(b)  The director shall require haulers of industrial wastewater to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director may require generators of hauled waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled waste. The discharge of hauled waste is subject to all other requirements and fees of this chapter. 
(c)  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the director. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director. The director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The director may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
(d)  Industrial waste hauler must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type industry or business, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
(Ord. No. 887, § 1, 3-17-97) 
Sec. 23-22. - Prohibited discharges. 
(a)  No person shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibition apply to all such users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(1)  Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or quantity, are or may be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five (5) percent nor any single reading over ten (10) percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols (other than ethanol or methanol), ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides, and sulfides and any other substance which Auburndale, the State of Florida or the EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. 
(2)  Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size as may cause obstructions to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, such as, but not limited to: Grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half (1/2) inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch, manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass-grinding or-polishing wastes. 
(3)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or greater than 9.5, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW or to exceed the limitations set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A "toxic pollutant" shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the act. 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(6)  Any substances which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
(7)  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving-water-quality standards. 
(8)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(9)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds 40° C (104°F), unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such temperature. 
(10)  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have flow rate or contain concentration or qualities or pollutants that exceed, for any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes, more than five (5) times the average twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operation. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether emulsified or not, in exceed of one hundred (100) mg/L or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) degrees and one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (zero (0) and sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius). 
(13)  Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. 
(14)  Any waters or wastes containing strong acid-iron pickling wastes or concentrated plating solutions, whether neutralized or not. 
(15)  Materials which exert or cause: 
a.  Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate). 
b.  Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions). 
c.  Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the POTW. 
d.  Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting "slugs" as defined herein. 
e.  Unusual total phosphorous or total nitrogen concentrations in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the POTW. 
f.  Alternation of a soils assimilative properties, particularly its hydraulic conductivity, that may inhibit application of reclaimed water to such soil (i.e., a discharge with a sodium absorption ratio (SAR) =10). 
(16)  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. When the director determines that a user(s) is contributing to the POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the director shall: 
a.  Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and 
b.  Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the interference with the POTW. 
(17)  Trucked or hauled pollutants are prohibited, except at discharge points designated by the director in accordance with section 23-21 of this article. 
(b)  Local limits. 
(1)  No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the local limits for those pollutants which have been established for the City of Auburndale's POTWs using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass through, interference, protection of POTW employees, and adverse affects on wastewater residuals disposal. No industrial user shall discharge process waste streams, unregulated waste streams, or dilute waste streams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the director. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each SIU wastewater permit issued. 
(2)  The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, POTW operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation shall be effective thirty (30) days from notice of acceptance of the modified limits by FDEP. Permitted SIUs shall also be issued an addendum to their wastewater discharge permit containing the new local limits. 
(3)  The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. At his or her discretion, the director may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations. 
(4)  A copy of the approved local limits is available upon request from the Auburndale Public Utilities Department 215 Main Street Auburndale, FL 33823. 
(c)  Any user discharging or anticipating a discharge of substances in his wastes within ten (10) percent or in excess of the concentrations identified in subsection 23-22(b) may be classified as a significant industrial user and subject to the wastewater discharge permitting requirements of this article. Industrial users may not apply for variances to local limits. The control authority shall not give industrial users individual allocations of a pollutant. 
(d)  If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which, in the judgment of the director, may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW, processes equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the director may: 
(1)  Reject the wastes; 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharges; 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges; 
(5)  Require payment to cover the added cost of a monitoring program to determine compliance with the requirements of this article. 
    If the director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the director and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(e)  Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industria subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The director shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12. 
(f)  Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean a reduction in the amount of a pollutant or an alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety-five (95) percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the act. Auburndale may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part 403, Section 403.7, are fulfilled, and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(g)  State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. 
(h)  Auburndale reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 23-17 of this article. 
(i)  No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitations developed by Auburndale or the State of Florida. 
(j)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place, advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge or a discharge in violation of the wastewater discharge permit. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(k)  Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or significant industrial user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans, showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection, shall be submitted to the director for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing significant industrial users shall complete such a plan by January 1, 1989. No significant industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge prevention procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the significant industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the significant industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident The notifications shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(l)  Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the significant industrial user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the significant industria user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or any other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the significant industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(m)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, and adopted in reference in Chapter 62-660, F.A.C. are hereby incorporated. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the City of Auburndale may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with Rule 62-625.410(4), F.A.C. 
(2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the City of Auburndale shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste-stream formula in Rule 62-625.410(6), F.A.C. 
(3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in Rule 62-625.700, F.A.C., that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with Rule 62-625.820, F.A.C.

Sec. 23-24. - Preliminary treatment. 
    Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner or significant industrial user at his expense to the satisfaction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 710, § 10, 6-20-88) 
Sec. 23-25. - Manholes. 
    When required by the director, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer, to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(Ord. No. 710, § 11, 6-20-88) 
Sec. 23-26. - Measurements, tests and analyses. 
    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with procedures established by the Department of Environmental Protection's Standard Operating Procedures Manual, DEP-SOP-001/01. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (2) below, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the City of Auburndale may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(Ord. No. 710, § 12, 6-20-88; Ord. No. 1234, § 11, 3-20-06) 
Sec. 23-27. - Special agreements. 
    Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor. However, such special agreements will not override any national categorical pretreatment standards or local toxic limitations.

Sec. 23-28. - Malicious or negligent injury to sewage works prohibited. 
    No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the POTW. Any person violating this section shall be subject to immediate arrest. 
(Ord. No. 710, § 14, 6-20-88) 
Sec. 23-29. - Power and authority of director. 
    The director and other duly authorized employees of the city, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing, reviewing and copying records in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 710, § 15, 6-20-88; Ord. No. 795, § 2, 6-7-93) 
Sec. 23-30. - Violations; notice; corrections; hearings; penalties. 
(a)  Whenever any person has violated or is violating this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirement contained herein, the director shall serve or cause to be served upon such person, by hand delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested, a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Except as may otherwise be provided herein, within thirty (30) days after the date of said notice, the violator shall submit to the director a plan for correcting violations, which shall set forth the manner of correction and the time within which all such violations will be cured. The plan must also set forth interim deadlines and schedules as the director may deem appropriate. 
(b)  (1)  In the event that the violator fails to submit a plan required by subsection (a) hereof, or in the event that the plan submitted is not satisfactory to the director, the director may issue; 
a.  Consent order. The City of Auburndale may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to parts (b)(1)a. and b. of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
b.  Compliance order/schedule. When the City of Auburndale finds that a user has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this subsection (b)(1), a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City of Auburndale may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the non-compliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
c.  Cease and desist order. When the City of Auburndale finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subsection (b)(1), a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge or, take any enforcement action authorized by the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Prior to the date that any such enforcement action becomes effective, the violators shall be served with a notice identifying the enforcement action to be taken and informing the violator that he has a right to appeal any decision, interpretation or action of the director to the city manager, as provided herein. 
(c)  (1)  Any person determined to be violating the provisions of this article or any wastewater discharge permit and any user directly affected may appeal a decision, interpretation or order of the director to the city manager. 
(2)  An appeal authorized by subsection (c)(1) hereof shall be instituted by the filing of a notice or appeal within ten (10) days after the date that any person violating or any user directly affected receives notice of the decision, interpretation or order of the director claimed to be erroneous. The notice of appeal shall he filed with the director and shall be accompanied by a fifty-dollar filing fee. The notice of appeal shall set forth the decision, interpretation or order of the director appealed from and shall briefly set forth the grounds for the appeal. 
(3)  Within fifteen (15) days after the date that the notice of appeal is filed with the director, the city manager shall schedule and hold a public hearing, for the purpose of considering the appeal, based upon the grounds set forth in the notice of appeal. The public hearing may be continued by the city manager upon his own motion or at the request of the director or the appealing party. A notice of the public hearing, scheduled by the city manager to consider the appeal, shall be served upon the person filing the appeal, by hand delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the time and place of the hearing and providing notification that, should any person decide to appeal a decision of the city manager, a verbatim record may be necessary. 
(4)  At the hearing, the city manager shall consider the evidence and arguments presented in the hearing and may either affirm the decision, interpretation or order of the director or may reverse same, or may vary any such decision, interpretation or order. Any decision by the city manager shall be in writing, setting forth findings of fact and conclusions. All testimony before the city manager shall be under oath. Neither the Florida Evidence Code nor the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply, but the hearing shall otherwise comply with the essential requirements of due process. The decision of the city manager shall be final. 
(d)  Emergency suspensions: Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the director may immediately suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the director, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent and substantial threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or which would cause irreparable harm to the environment, interference with the POTW, or which would cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City of Auburndale may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTWM its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The City of Auburndale may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection 23-30(e) of this section are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the City of Auburndale prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection 23-30(c) or 23-30(e) of this section. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(e)  In the enforcement of this article, the director may: 
(1)  Terminate wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit for the following reasons: 
a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of it's discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in subsection 23-22(b)(3) of this section. 
(2)  Revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including but not limited to, the following reasons: 
a.  Failure to notify the City of Auburndale of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
b.  Failure to provide prior notification to the City of Auburndale of changed conditions pursuant to subsection 23-20.1(c)(9) of this section; 
c.  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application; 
d.  Falsifying self-monitoring reports; 
e.  Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
f.  Refusing to allow City of Auburndale personnel timely access to the facility premises and records; 
g.  Failure to meet effluent limitations; 
h.  Failure to pay fines; 
i.  Failure to pay sewer charges; 
j.  Failure to meet compliance schedules; 
k.  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; 
l.  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; or 
m.  Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234]. 
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user. 
(3)  Establish measures designed to correct violations and compliance schedules therefore; 
(f)  Any fine imposed by the director, if not promptly paid, may result in the termination of wastewater service or the suspension or revocation of a wastewater discharge permit; and any such fine may be recovered by the director, in the name of the city, as any other indebtedness by filing an action for the recovery thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such action, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs, interest and attorney's fees. 
(g)  Remedies. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. When the City of Auburndale finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234], a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may petition the circuit court through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234] on activities of the user. The City of Auburndale may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. 
a.  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234], a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City of Auburndale for a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
b.  The City of Auburndale may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
c.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
d.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(3)  Criminal prosecution. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234], a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement; or who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage, or who knowingly makes any false statement, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234], wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234] shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree punishable by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both, which penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law. 
(4)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provide for in this ordinance [Ordinance No. 1234] are nonexclusive. The City of Auburndale may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with city's enforcement response plan. However, the City of Auburndale may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the City of Auburndale is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(5)  [Additional charges.] In addition to the remedies available to the city as set forth elsewhere in this article, if the city is fined by the State of Florida, the EPA or any other governmental agency, for a violation of water quality standards as a result of a discharge of pollutants, then the fine and all city legal, sampling, analytical testing and any other related costs shall be charged to the person or persons responsible for said discharge of pollutants. Such charges shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies the city may have under this article, or under any statutes or regulations, at law or in equity. 
(h)  If the discharge from any user causes a deposit, obstruction or damage to the POTW, then the director shall cause the deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to be promptly repaired at the sole cost of the person or user causing such deposit, obstruction or damage. 
(i)  Any person who knowingly makes a false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article or pursuant to any wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or sampling or analysis or information-gathering method required under this article shall be subject to the penalties and costs provided in this section and any other penalty that may be provided under this article or any other applicable local, state or federal law or regulation. 
(j)  Should there be a difference in understanding between the city and any person as to the characteristics in the wastewater, the city reserves the right to use the city analyses and results to thereafter compute any fees that may be assessed. 
(k)  Nothing contained herein is intended to preclude the city from taking immediate action to temporarily modify a permit or to sever service of an industry completely when there is imminent risk of injury or interference to the POTW or to the public health, safety and welfare of the public or to the environment. 
(l)  The city shall develop and implement an enforcement response plan in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5). 
(m)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(1)  Upset. 
a.  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
b.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c., below, are met. 
c.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
1.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
2.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
3.  The user has submitted the following information to the City of Auburndale within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
d.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
e.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
f.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(2)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsections 23-22(a)(1)-(18) of this article or the specific prohibitions in subsections 23-22(b) and 23-22(m) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City of Auburndale was regularly in compliance with it' NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(3)  Bypass. 
a.  For the purposes of this section, "bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  For the purposes of this section, "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
c.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs d. and e. of this section. 
d.  1.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the City of Auburndale, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
2.  A user shall submit oral notice to the City of Auburndale of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The City of Auburndale may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
e.  Bypass is prohibited, and the City of Auburndale may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless; 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph 2. of this section. 
f.  The City of Auburndale may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)a. of this section.

Sec. 23-31. - Maintenance of sewers. 
(a)  The customer shall be responsible for the maintenance of the building sewer: Specifically, all plumbing from the public sewer into, and including, the house plumbing. Nevertheless, the city shall assume the responsibility for that portion of the building sewer in the public right-of-way or easement where defective or faulty materials or workmanship are involved.

that is zoned residential or institutional.
5.2.6.1.4. Where a lot to be used for a service station and/or convenience
store abuts on any property which is zoned residential or institutional,
there shall be a solid wall designed and installed on all such property
lines, other than street lines, which will prevent auto lights, smoke,
fumes, dust and other obnoxious materials (from ground level to the

institutional district. The solid wall shall be a minimum of 6 feet in
height.
5.2.6.1.5. No fuel pump or storage tank shall be located within 15 feet of
any street right-of-way line. Where a street setback line has been
established, no fuel pump or storage tank shall be located within 15
feet of such setback line. Where conditions of traffic safety, due to
street intersections, lack of visibility at a street crown or other peculiar
circumstances prevail, additional setbacks may be required by the
Administrative Official, but in no case shall they be required to exceed
25 feet.
5.2.6.1.6. The number of curb breaks for a service station and/or
convenience store shall not exceed 2 for each 100 feet of street
frontage, each having a width of not more than 40 feet and located not

industrial districts. No such sale of automotive fuel as an accessory
use shall be permitted or permissible by special exception in
connection with conforming or nonconforming uses in any other
zoning district.
5.2.6.2.2. Accessory sales of this nature, and services performed in
connection therewith, shall be limited to sale of automotive fuel,
replenishing oil, washing windshields, windows and lights, providing
air for tires, providing water and additives for radiators, and other

Essential services, herewith defined as services authorized and regulated by State or
national public utility commissions or services owned or franchised by the City or
County, may be located within any zoning district after review and approval by the
City Commission. This provision includes both structures and uses and includes
LDR5 - 9
gas, water, electric, sewerage and telephone facilities. However, this provision shall
not be deemed to permit the location in a district of such establishments as electric
or gas generating plants, sewage treatment plants, water pumping facilities or
aeration facilities, liquid petroleum gas storage facilities above or below ground from
which they would be otherwise prohibited and provided, further, that this provision
shall not be deemed to include the establishment of structures for commercial
activities such as sales or the collection of bills in districts from which such
activities would be otherwise prohibited.
Under this provision, where structures are involved, such structures shall conform
insofar as possible to the character of the district as to architecture and landscaping

Sec. 5.2.9. TEMPORARY STRUCTURES, GENERAL.
Temporary structures in connection with land development or construction projects
may be erected or moved onto the site, for occupancy other than as dwelling or
lodging units, in any zoning district, but shall require a permit from the
Administrative Official. Such permit shall specify location, type of construction,
maintenance requirements and period for which such structure may be erected;
provided, that no such permit shall be for a period of more than 6 months, subject to
renewal upon approval of the Administrative Official. Failure to obtain such permit
or violation of conditions specified therein shall be a violation of the Land
Development Regulations.
Sec. 5.2.10. LOTS; DEFINITIONS; AND METHODS FOR MEASUREMENT.
5.2.10.1. LOT. For purposes of the Land Development Regulations, a lot is
defined as a parcel of land of at least sufficient size to meet minimum
requirements for use, width, coverage and total area, and to provide such
yards and other open spaces as are required. Such lot shall have frontage
on an improved public street, or on an approved private street, and may
consist of:
LDR5 - 10
5.2.10.1.1. A single lot of record;
5.2.10.1.2. A portion of a lot of record;
5.2.10.1.3. A combination of complete lots of records, of complete lots of
record and portions of lots of record, or of portions of lots of record;
5.2.10.1.4. A parcel of land described by metes and bounds; provided, that
in no case of division or combination shall any residual lot or parcel be
created which does not meet the requirements of this Chapter.
5.2.10.2. LOT FRONTAGE. The front of a lot shall be defined to be that
portion of the lot nearest the street established as the street address. For the
purposes of determining yard requirements on corner lots and through lots,
all sides of a lot adjacent to streets shall be considered frontage, and yards
shall be provided as indicated in this Chapter.
5.2.10.3. LOT MEASUREMENTS.
5.2.10.3.1. Depth of a lot shall be defined to be the distance between the
midpoints of straight lines connecting the foremost points of the side
lot lines in front and the rear most points of the side lot lines in the
rear.
5.2.10.3.2. Lot width determinations as related to minimums prescribed in
the Land Development Regulations, shall be measured across the
rear of the required front yard; provided, that in the case of wedge
shaped lots with narrow ends and cul-de-sac or other acute street
curvatures, the rear line of the required front yard shall be moved
sufficiently from the front line to provide at least 80% of the generally
required lot width at the rear line of the required front yard.
5.2.10.3.3. Lot area, for determinations relating to minimum lot size as
required by the Land Development Regulations, shall be calculated to
include only the total area of the upland soils of the lot; except, that
where lots are of such peculiar or irregular shape that portions have
no useful functions in relation to buildable areas, such portions also
shall not be included in computation of total area.
5.2.10.4. LOT OF RECORD. A lot which is part of a subdivision recorded in the
office of the County Clerk, or a lot or parcel described by metes and bounds,
the description of which has been so recorded on or before the effective date
of the original Zoning Ordinance of the City which shall be August 7, 1961
and all subsequent amendments.
LDR5 - 11
5.2.10.5. LOT TYPES. The diagram below illustrates descriptive terminology
used in the Land Development Regulations with reference to corner lots,
interior lots, through lots, and reversed frontage lots.
5.2.10.5.1. In the diagram, A is a corner lot, defined as a lot located at the
intersection of two or more streets. A lot abutting on a curved street
or streets shall be considered a corner lot if straight lines drawn from
the foremost points of the side lot lines to the foremost point of the lot meet
at an interior angle of less than 135 degrees. See lots marked A (1) in the
diagram.
5.2.10.5.2. B is an interior lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot with
only one frontage on a street.
5.2.10.5.3. C is a through lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot with
frontage on more than one street. Through lots abutting two streets
may be referred to as double frontage lots.
5.2.10.5.4. D is a reversed frontage lot, defined as a lot on which the
frontage is at right angles or approximate right angles (interior angle
less than 135 degrees) to the general pattern in the area. A reversed
frontage lot may be a corner lot (A-D in the diagram), an interior lot
(B-D) or a through lot (C-D).
5.2.10.6. LOT COVERAGE. That percentage of lot area that is or may be
covered or occupied by buildings, including accessory buildings, under the
terms of the Land Development Regulations.
LDR5 - 12
Sec. 5.2.11. YARD; DEFINITIONS AND METHODS FOR MEASUREMENT.
5.2.11.1. YARD. For purposes of the Land Development Regulations a
yard is defined as the minimum required open space, other than a court,
unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or portion of a structure from
30 inches above the general ground level of the graded lot upward; provided,
that fences, walls, poles, posts and other customary yard accessories, such
as ornaments and furniture may be permitted in any yard subject to height
limitations and requirements limiting obstruction of visibility. A court is an
uncovered open space enclosed on 2 or more sides by exterior walls of a
building.
5.2.11.2. YARD, FRONT.
5.2.11.2.1. A yard adjacent to a public or private street and extending
across the entire front of the lot. All corner lots and lots extending
through blocks in such a way as to have frontage on 2 or more public
or private streets shall provide the minimum yard requirements equal
to front yards to all property adjacent to each street.
5.2.11.2.2. Depth of required front yards shall be measured perpendicular
to a straight line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. The
foremost points of side lot lines, in the case of rounded property
corners, as at street intersections, or irregular corners, shall be
assumed to be the points at which lines would have met without
rounding or irregularity. Front and the front of the rear yard lines shall
be parallel.
5.2.11.3. YARD, SIDE.
5.2.11.3.1. A yard extending from the rear line of a required front yard to
the rear or back property line, or in cases where more than one front
yard is required, as on a through lot, to the rear line of the second
front yard. In the case of corner lots, those yards adjacent to streets
remaining after front yards have been established shall be considered
side yards, but shall be required to have the same distance as the
required front yard.
5.2.11.3.2. Width of a required side yard shall be measured in a manner
similar to that employed in measurement of depth for required front
yards, so that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width
required with its inner edge parallel to the side lot line at its outer
edge.
LDR5 - 13
5.2.11.4. YARD, REAR.
5.2.11.4.1. A yard extending between required side yards at the rear of the
lot. In the case of lots having more than one front yard, remaining
yards shall be considered side yards.
5.2.11.4.2. Depth of a required rear yard shall be measured in a manner
similar to that employed in measurement of depth for required front
yards, so that the yard established is a strip of the minimum depth
required with its inner edge parallel to the rear lot line at its outer
edge.
5.2.11.5. YARD, SPECIAL. A yard behind any required yard adjacent to a
public or private street, required to perform the same functions as a side or
rear yard, but adjacent to a lot line and so placed or oriented that neither the
term "side yard" nor the term "rear yard" clearly applies. In such cases the
Administrative Official shall require a yard with minimum dimensions as
generally required for a side yard or a rear yard in the zoning district,
determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of the lot on which
the yard is to be located to the adjoining lot or lots, with due regard to the
orientation and location of structures and buildable areas thereon.
5.2.11.6. YARD, WATER. A yard adjacent to a public body of water or an
inlet or stream with a width of 10 feet or greater and extending across the
entire water side of the lot.

determinations shall be so made before notice of violation is issued.
5.3.13.3. Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense make it
unreasonable for the City to maintain personnel or equipment necessary for
making difficult or unusual determinations, procedures as herein set out shall
be available for protecting individuals from arbitrary and capricious
administration and enforcement of performance standard regulations, and for
protecting the general public from unnecessary costs for administration and
enforcement.
Sec. 5.3.14. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT - WHEN DETERMINATIONS
CAN BE MADE WITHOUT GREAT EXPENSE.
Where determination of violation of performance standards can be made by the
Administrative Official or other duly designated City employees using equipment and
personnel available to the City or obtainable without extraordinary expense, determination
of violation shall be made. The Administrative Official shall take or cause to be taken lawful
action as provided by this Chapter to eliminate such violation. Failure to obey lawful orders
concerning cessation of violation shall be punishable as provided in this Chapter.
Sec. 5.3.15. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT - WHEN DETERMINATION OF
VIOLATION REQUIRES HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL AND EXPENSIVE
INSTRUMENTS.
Where determination of violation of performance standards entails the use of highly skilled
personnel and expensive instrumentation not ordinarily available to the City, and when, in
the considered judgment of the Administrative Official a violation exists, procedure shall be
as follows:
5.3.15.1. NOTICE. The Administrative Official shall give written notice, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means insuring a signed
receipt for such notice, to those responsible for the alleged violation. Such
notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons
why the Administrative Official believes there is a violation in fact, and shall
require an answer or a correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of
the Administrative Official within a reasonable time limit set by the
Administrative Official but in no case more than 10 days. The notice shall
state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or to correct the alleged
violation to the satisfaction of the Administrative Official within the time limit
set constitutes admission of violation. The notice shall further state that upon
request of those to whom it is directed, technical determinations as described
in the appropriate portions of this Chapter will be made; and that if violation
LDR5 - 34
as alleged is found, costs of the determinations shall be charged against
those responsible, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate;
and that if it is determined that no violation exists, costs of the determinations
will be paid by the City.
5.3.15.2. CORRECTION OF VIOLATION WITHIN TIME LIMIT. If, within the
time limit set, there is no reply but the alleged violation is corrected to the
satisfaction of the Administrative Official, he shall note "Violation Corrected"
on his copy of the notice and shall retain it as part of his records, taking such
other action as may be warranted by the circumstances of the case.
5.3.15.3. NO CORRECTION; NO REPLY. If there is no reply within the time
limit set, thus establishing admission of violation as provided in Subsection
5.3.15.1. above, and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction
of the Administrative Official within the time limit set, he shall take or cause to
be taken such action as warranted by continuation of an admitted violation
after notice to cease.
5.3.15.4. REPLY REQUESTING EXTENSION OF TIME. If a reply is received
within the time limit set indicating that an alleged violation will be corrected to
the satisfaction of the Administrative Official, but that more time is required
than was granted by the original notice, the Administrative Official may grant
an extension of time, if he deems such extension warranted in the
circumstances of the case, and if such extension will not, in his opinion,
cause imminent peril to life, health, or property. In acting on such requests
for extension of time, the Administrative Official shall in writing state his
reasons for granting or refusing to grant the extension and shall transmit the
same by certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means insuring a
signed receipt, as provided in Subsection 5.3.15.1. above, to those to whom
original notice was sent. Such extension(s) shall have a maximum 30 day
time limit.
5.3.15.5. REPLY REQUESTING TECHNICAL DETERMINATION. If a reply is
received within the time limit set requesting technical determinations as
described in the appropriate provisions of this Article, and if the alleged
violations continue, the Administrative Official may call in properly qualified
experts to make the determinations. If expert findings indicate violation of the
performance standards, the costs of the determinations shall be assessed
against the properties or persons responsible for the violations, in addition to
such other penalties as may be appropriate under Chapter 24 of the Land
Development Regulations. If no violation is found, costs of the determination
shall be paid by the City without assessment against the properties or
persons involved.

ARTICLE 4. NONCONFORMING USES.
Sec. 5.4.1. INTENT.
5.4.1.1. Within the districts established by the Land Development Regulations
or amendments that may later be adopted there exist:
5.4.1.1.1. Lots;
5.4.1.1.2. Structures;
5.4.1.1.3. Uses of land and structures; and
5.4.1.1.4. Characteristics of use which were lawful prior to the effective
date of the original Zoning Ordinance adopted on August 7, 1961, and
all subsequent amendments but which would be prohibited, regulated,
or restricted under the terms of the Land Development Regulations or
future amendments.
It is the intent of this Article to permit certain of these non-conformities
to continue without increase in the degree of nonconformity but to
discourage the survival of certain other nonconformities.
5.4.1.2. Nonconforming uses and nonconforming characteristics of either
conforming or nonconforming uses are declared by this Article to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the zoning district involved, to be a threat
to the character and stability of the district, and to economic values generally
within the district. In view of these effects, it is the intent of this Article that
certain nonconforming uses be discontinued and that no existing
nonconforming use be extended or enlarged, except as provided herein by
the addition of other uses of a nature prohibited generally in the district
involved.
5.4.1.3. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Article shall be deemed to
require change in plans approved by the Administrative Official prior to the
effective date of adoption of the Land Development Regulations or
amendment thereof; construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
of the Land Development Regulations or amendment thereof and upon which
actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual
construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials
in permanent position on the site and fastened in a permanent manner.
Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition
or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work
LDR5 - 36
shall be carried on diligently until the completion of the new construction
involved.
Sec. 5.4.2. NONCONFORMING LOT(S) OF RECORD.
5.4.2.1. In any district in which single family detached dwellings are permitted,
a single family detached dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record existing at the effective date of adoption or
subsequent amendments of the original Zoning Ordinance adopted August 6,
1971, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Article.
The provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the zoning district;
provided, that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying
to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. A variance of yard requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment. No lot presently
classified nonconforming under the preceding administered Zoning Chapter
shall be declared a conforming lot under the provisions of this Article unless
or until such lot meets the minimum requirements set forth herein and as
applied in the zoning district in which such lot is located.
5.4.2.2. There shall not be any division of any parcel of land which creates a
lot with a width or area below the minimum requirements stated in this
Chapter, except as provided below.
Sec. 5.4.3. NONCONFORMING LAND OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY.
If at time of the effective date or subsequent amendment of the Land Development
Regulations lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations
imposed, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost
exceeding $2,000:
5.4.3.1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption of the LDR or subsequent amendment of the LDR;
5.4.3.2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of adoption of the LDR or subsequent amendment of the LDR.
5.4.3.3. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 6 months, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by the LDR for the zoning district in
which such land is located;
LDR5 - 37
5.4.3.4. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of the LDR
shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land, nor shall
any structure destroyed or deteriorated to the extent of 50% or more of
replacement value be replaced.
Sec. 5.4.4. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption of the LDR or subsequent
amendment of the LDR that could not be built under the terms of the LDR by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
5.4.4.1. No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may
be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
5.4.4.2. Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except
in conformity with the provisions of the LDR;
5.4.4.3. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning
district in which it is located after it is removed.
Sec. 5.4.5. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OR STRUCTURES AND PREMISES
COMBINED.
If, except as hereinafter provided in Sec. 5.4.4., at the effective date of the LDR or
subsequent amendment of the LDR lawful use exists involving individual structures with a
replacement cost exceeding $2,000, or such structures and premises in combination, and
such use would not be permitted by the regulations imposed;
5.4.5.1. Except as hereinafter provided, no such structure shall be enlarged,
extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in
changing the use to one permitted in the district;
5.4.5.2. Any nonconforming use may be extended through parts of a building
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of the LDR
or subsequent amendment of the LDR but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
5.4.5.3. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of such
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed
to another nonconforming use; provided, that the Board of Adjustment shall
LDR5 - 38
find that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate in the location than
the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of
Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with
the provisions of the LDR;
5.4.5.4. If a nonconforming use of such structure, or structure and premises, is
superseded by a permitted use, such use shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the zoning district, and no nonconforming use shall thereafter
be begun or resumed;
5.4.5.5. If a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 6 consecutive months or for
18 months during any 3 year period (except, when government action
impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located;
5.4.5.6. Where nonconforming use status applies to such structure and
premises in combination, removal or destruction or major deterioration of the
structure to the extent of more than 50% of replacement cost shall eliminate
the nonconforming status of the land.
Sec. 5.4.6. RECONSTRUCTION OR ALTERATION OF SOME STRUCTURES.
The Board of Adjustment may permit, as a special exception, reconstruction or structural
alteration of individual structures with a replacement cost exceeding $2,000, containing
nonconforming uses, upon a finding that such use is likely to continue indefinitely with or
without such reconstruction or structural alteration, and that the proposed reconstruction or
structural reconstruction or structural alteration will result in substantial improvement in
appearance of the premises or other public benefits in keeping with the purposes of zoning.
Site and building plans shall be included with applications for such special exceptions as
required in the LDR, and if approved shall be binding on the petitioner and his successors
in title. Such reconstruction or alteration shall be subject to the following general
requirements and limitations, in addition to conditions and safeguards which may be added
to fit the particular circumstances of the case:
5.4.6.1. Where a lot abuts or adjoins a lot in a residential district, a solid wall or
solid structural screen shall be provided and maintained as necessary to
protect adjoining residential property from lights, noise or undesirable views,
dust, fumes or other obnoxious conditions. Such solid wall or solid structural
screen shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height;
5.4.6.2. If a nonresidential use, off-street parking areas for short term use by
customers or other visitors to the premises shall be located and improved in
such a manner as to minimize potential adverse effects from light, noise or
LDR5 - 39
dust. Off-street parking space shall be provided as required for the first
zoning district in which the use is permitted;
5.4.6.3. If the use is nonresidential, signs shall be limited as to location and
illumination as for the most restrictive commercial zoning district. Number of
signs shall not exceed 3, with total surface area not exceeding 30 sq.ft.
Orientation of signs shall be toward the street, with as little exposure as
practicable to adjoining residential districts;
5.4.6.4. Minimum yard requirements, maximum height, percent of lot coverage
and impervious surface coverage requirements for the zoning district in which
the nonconforming use is located shall apply.
5.4.6.5. The floor area devoted to nonresidential nonconforming uses shall not
be increased more than 20% in any reconstruction or alteration authorized by
any such special exception. Floor area of residential nonconforming use may
be increased by as much as 40% under this provision. In all cases of floor
area increase, the allowable percentage shall be based upon the existing
floor area as of the date of adoption of the LDR and no further increases shall
be permitted for the nonconforming use.
Sec. 5.4.7. NONCONFORMING SIGNS, OFF-STREET PARKING, AND RELATED
CHARACTERISTICS OF USE.
If characteristics of use, such as signs, off-street parking or other matters pertaining to the
use of land, structures or premises, are made nonconforming by the LDR, no change shall
be made in such characteristics of use which increases the degree of nonconformity with
the regulations of the LDR, but changes may be made which decreases such
nonconformity.
Sec. 5.4.8. ORDINARY REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
5.4.8.1. Except as provided in this Article, on any nonconforming structure or
portion of structure, and on any structure or portion containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or
maintenance of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing; provided:
5.4.8.1.1. That the cubic content of the nonconforming structure or
portion shall not be increased, and
5.4.8.1.2. That these provisions shall apply only where deterioration is not
to an extent of 50% or more of replacement cost of the structure or
portion thereof.
5.4.8.2. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the strengthening or restoring
to safe condition of a structure or portion thereof declared to be unsafe by
LDR5 - 40
any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such
official.
Sec. 5.4.9. USES PERMISSIBLE UNDER SPECIAL EXCEPTION PROVISIONS NOT
TO BE CONSIDERED NONCONFORMING USES.
Any use which is permissible as a special exception in a zoning district under the terms of
the LDR, other than a change through Board of Adjustment action from a nonconforming
use to another use not generally permitted in the district, shall not be deemed a
nonconforming use in such zoning district, but shall without further action be considered a
conforming use.
ARTICLE 5. ZONING MAP; ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS; INTERPRETATION;
APPLICATION.
Sec. 5.5.1. OFFICIAL ZONING MAP ADOPTED.
5.5.1.1. The City is hereby divided into zoning districts, as shown on the

Auburndale, Florida," together with the date of adoption.
5.5.1.3. If changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed

Commission with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows: "On (date),
by official action of the City Commission the following (change) changes were
made on the Official Zoning Map: (brief description of nature of change or

5.5.1.4. No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in
the LDR. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person shall be

provisions of the LDR.
LDR5 - 41
5.5.1.5. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning
Map which may from time to time be made or published, the Official Zoning
Map which shall be located in the office of the City Clerk shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings
and other structures in the City.
Sec. 5.5.2. REPLACEMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
5.5.2.1. In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of
changes and additions, the City Commission may by resolution adopt a new
Official Zoning Map, may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the
prior Official Zoning Map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of
amending the original Official Zoning Map or any subsequent amendment
thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of
the Mayor attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the City under
the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map
supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption
of map being replaced) as part of Ordinance No. ____ of the City of
Auburndale, Florida."
5.5.2.2. Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost, or has been totally
destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be
preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or
amendment.

would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel; and in such case the
boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the
zoning status of any lot or parcel;
5.5.3.6. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streams, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow
such center line and to be at the limit of the jurisdiction of the City, unless
otherwise indicated;
5.5.3.7. Boundaries indicated as following railroad tracks shall be construed as

the Planning Commission shall interpret the district boundaries; and
5.5.3.10. Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single
ownership prior to the adoption date of the zoning ordinance which was in
effect at the time of adoption of the Land Development Regulations, the
Board of Adjustment may permit, as a special exception, the extension of the
regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the
district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
Sec. 5.5.4. APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.

on the Official Zoning Map by amending action. Until such action, it is intended to
leave lands which might in the future be encompassed by such Planned
Development boundaries in more traditional classifications indicated on the Official
Zoning Map, since the boundaries of such Planned Development districts are not
intended to be fixed as to location in advance of petition and amendment.
6.1.1.1. INTENT.
6.1.1.1.1. Within districts now existing or which may hereafter be created,
it is intended to permit, on application and on approval of required site,
use, building and development plans, establishment of new Planned
Developed (PD) districts for specialized purposes where tracts
suitable in location, area and character for the uses and structures
proposed are to be planned and developed as units. Suitability of such
tracts for the plans and development proposed for the PD district shall
be determined by consistency with the City Comprehensive Plan and
the existing and prospective character of surrounding development.
6.1.1.1.2. Within PD districts, regulations adapted to such unified
planning and development are intended to accomplish the purposes of
zoning and other applicable regulations to the same degree as in
districts in which regulations are intended to control development on a
lot-by-lot rather than a unified basis, and to promote economical and
efficient land use, an improved level of amenities, appropriate and
harmonious variety in physical development, creative design, and a
better urban environment.
6.1.1.1.3. In view of the substantial public advantages of planned
development, it is the intent of these regulations to promote and
encourage development in this form, where appropriate in location
and character, and to further the purposes of the Comprehensive
Plan.
LDR 6 - 3
6.1.1.2. RELATION OF PD REGULATIONS TO GENERAL ZONING,
SUBDIVISION OR OTHER LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
6.1.1.2.1. The provisions which follow shall apply generally to the creation
and regulation of all Planned Development districts. Where there are
conflicts between the special PD provisions herein and general
zoning, subdivision or other Land Development Regulations or
requirements, these special regulations shall apply in PD districts
unless the governing body shall find, in the particular case:
6.1.1.2.1.1. That provisions herein do not serve public purposes to a
degree at least equivalent to such general zoning, subdivision
or other Land Development Regulations or requirements, or
6.1.1.2.1.2. That actions, designs, or solutions proposed by the
petitioner, although not literally in accord with these special
regulations or general regulations, satisfy public purposes to at
least an equivalent degree. It is specifically provided, however,
that where land use intensity ratings, densities or floor area
and similar ratios have been established by this Chapter, the
City Commission shall not act in a particular case to increase
the land use intensity rating of property, or similar ratios nor
increase the established maximum permitted densities.
6.1.1.2.2. Except as indicated above, procedures and requirements
generally in effect, those set forth herein, and in guides and standards
adopted as part of these regulations for particular classes of PD
districts, shall apply in PD districts and to amendments for such
districts and issuance of development orders, building permits and
certificates of occupancy therein.
6.1.1.3. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DEFINED. For purposes of this Chapter,
a planned development is:
6.1.1.3.1. Land under unified ownership and control to be planned and
developed as a whole, in a single development operation or a
programmed series of development operations, including all lands and
buildings, and within a specified time frame;
6.1.1.3.2. For principal and accessory structures and uses substantially
related to the character of the district and in compliance with the
Comprehensive Plan;
6.1.1.3.3. According to master plans which include not only streets,
utilities, lots or building sites, but also site plans, general floor plans
LDR 6 - 4
and typical elevations for all buildings as intended to be located,
constructed, used and related to each other, and plans for other uses
and improvements on the land as related to the buildings; and
6.1.1.3.4. With a program for provision, operation and maintenance of
such areas, facilities and improvements as will be for common use by
some or all of the occupants of the district but will not be provided,
operated or maintained at general public expense.
6.1.1.3.5. The above conditions shall apply in modified form to planned
developments comprising 50 or more acres in total area. These
modifications shall not reduce the spirit or intent of this Article but shall
be based upon concept and preliminary plans and shall permit staged
development programs or phases as though the land area comprises
less than 50 acres.
6.1.1.4. PD DISTRICTS - WHERE PERMITTED.
6.1.1.4.1. Planned development districts may hereafter be established by
amendment to the Official Zoning Map where tracts suitable in
location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be
planned and developed as units, according to the requirements and
procedures herein set forth. PD districts shall be appropriately located
with respect to intended functions, to the pattern and timing of
development existing or proposed in the City Comprehensive Plan,
and to public and private facilities, in compliance with the City
Concurrency Management System. The following specific
requirements shall be met:
6.1.1.4.2. Relation to major streets. Except as specifically provided in
regulations for particular classes of planned development districts, PD
districts shall be so located with respect to arterial or collector streets
or provide direct access to such districts without creating traffic along
minor streets in residential neighborhoods outside the district.
6.1.1.4.3. Relation to utilities; public facilities and services.
6.1.1.4.3.1. PD districts shall be so located in relation to sanitary
sewers, water lines, storm and surface drainage systems and
other utility systems and installations that neither enlargement
nor extension of such systems will be required in manner, form,
character, location, degree, scale or timing not in keeping with
the provisions of the Concurrency Management System.
LDR 6 - 5
6.1.1.4.3.2. Such districts shall be located with respect to necessary
public facilities (as for example schools, parks and playgrounds
in the case of planned developments of a residential character)
as to have access to such facilities in keeping with the
provisions of the Concurrency Management System.
6.1.1.5. PHYSICAL CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT SITE. The site within
the proposed PD district shall be suitable for development in the manner
proposed without hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract, from
probability of flooding, erosion, or other dangers, annoyances, or
inconveniences. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and
topography shall all be determined to be appropriate to both kind and pattern
of use intended.
6.1.1.6. PROCEDURES ON PD AMENDMENTS.
6.1.1.6.1. Applications; materials to be submitted. Petitions for PD
amendments shall be submitted as for other zoning district
amendments. All such petitions shall be accompanied by a fee to be
set by the City Commission to offset the cost of administration,
publications, notices, and related activities required by this Chapter
and applicable provisions of the Land Development Regulations.
Materials submitted with the petition or on subsequent request by the
Planning Commission or City Commission shall include all plans,
maps, studies and reports which may be required to make the
determinations called for in the particular case, with sufficient copies
for necessary referrals and records.
6.1.1.6.2. In particular, there shall be supplied a report identifying all
property owners within the area of the proposed district and giving
evidence of unified control of its entire area. The report shall state
agreement of all present property owners:
6.1.1.6.2.1. To proceed with the proposed development according to
regulations existing when the map amendment creating the PD
district is passed, with such modifications as are set by the City
Commission and agreed to by the petitioner at the time of
amendment;
6.1.1.6.2.2. To provide agreements, contracts, deed restrictions and
sureties acceptable to the City for completion of such
development according to approved plans, and for continuing
operation and maintenance of such areas, facilities and
functions as are not to be provided, operated or maintained by
general public expense.
LDR 6 - 6
6.1.1.5.2.3. To establish a specified time frame for commencing and
accomplishing the development, and;
6.1.1.6.2.4. To bind their successors in title to any commitments
made under 6.1.1.6.2.1., 2. or 3. above.
6.1.1.6.3. Petitioners shall submit a survey or surveys at a scale of 1:100
or less, indicating boundaries and ownership of all properties involved,
ownership of adjoining properties, topography with contours at a
maximum of 2 foot intervals (except for parcels of 50 acres or more in
which case 5 foot contour intervals are acceptable for the concept
plan), physical features, water, if any, conditions of soil, subsoil, other
natural features and vegetative cover indicated in sufficient detail to
describe suitability of the site for proposed uses and structures.
6.1.1.6.4. Petitioners shall submit a master development plan at a scale
of not less than 1:100 related to the surveys and conditions above,
which plan as submitted with the petition may be a preliminary general
plan, to be developed and modified during further proceedings, into
detailed final form. The preliminary plan shall indicate generally the
approximate locations of all proposed buildings, typical building floor
plans and elevation sketches and the uses intended for each building
and of the total development; the approximate location and
dimensions of all the streets, drives and parking and loading areas;
open space designations (golf courses, parks and the like);
recreational facilities and service areas, the neighborhood commercial
service areas, if a part of this project; tabulations of total gross
acreage in the development and percentages devoted to open space,
impervious surfaces and other uses. Such tabulations shall be based
upon the Land Use Intensity (LUI) formulas stated below. If the
petitioner deems it necessary, they may submit analysis comparing
the proposed development in various aspects with conventional
approaches to development.
6.1.1.6.5. Specifically the preliminary plans shall include but are not
necessarily limited to:
6.1.1.6.5.1. Title of the proposed preliminary Planned Development
and the name of the developer and the professional project
planner.

demonstrating proposed traffic flow to access points and
thoroughfares outside the proposed development and
relationships thereto, and any requirements for new streets or
improvements that may be required outside the project as a
result of the development of the project. The proposed major
street plan should show the concept for internal access and
traffic flow and how it is proposed to separate vehicular and
pedestrian traffic within the project. The petitioner may submit
as a part of this traffic concept plan such proposals as may be
deemed necessary for a pedestrian system or otherwise for the
movement of persons by means other than privately owned
passenger vehicles.
6.1.1.6.5.4. A general drainage plan for the development, related
particularly to the City's master drainage plan.

petitioners shall submit a preliminary plan for the development
and detailed proposals in accord with the above provisions as a
basis for specific agreements concerning plans, programs or
instruments or specific modifications of details of the PD or
other zoning, subdivision or other Land Development
Regulation(s), where it is alleged by the applicant that such
modification serves public purposes to an equivalent degree.
6.1.1.6.5.11. An impact statement meeting the applicable
requirements of Chapter 6 of the Administration and
Procedures Manual.
6.1.1.7. PLANNING COMMISSION PROCEDURES. On petitions for PD
amendments, the Planning Commission shall proceed in general as for other
zoning amendments, but shall give special consideration to the below matters
and shall allow changes in original applications as indicated below.
6.1.1.8. PRE-HEARING CONFERENCES WITH PETITIONERS.
6.1.1.8.1. On request by petitioners, the Administrative Official and City
Staff shall meet with petitioners to review the original application,
including the report and the preliminary plan submitted with the report.
The purpose of such pre-hearing conference shall be to assist in
bringing the report, and the preliminary plan as nearly as possible into
conformity with these or other regulations applying in the case, and/or
to define specifically those variations from application of general
regulations which would otherwise apply, which appear justified in
view of equivalent service of the public purposes of such regulations.
6.1.1.8.2. In the course of such pre-hearing conferences, any
recommendation for changes shall be recorded in writing, and shall
become part of the record in the case. All such recommendations
shall be supported by stated reasons for the proposal for zoning
change. Petitioners shall in writing, indicate their agreement or
disagreement to such recommendations. If there is disagreement,
LDR 6 - 9
petitioners shall in writing indicate their reasons therefor. Responses
by petitioners shall also be included in writing and made a part of the
petition.
6.1.1.9. PUBLIC NOTICE AND HEARING. At such time as further
conferences appear unnecessary, or at any time on request of the petitioner,
public notice shall be given and hearings before the Planning Commission
held as for other amendments, but the notice and hearing shall be on the
petition as it may have been amended following the pre-hearing conferences
rather than as originally submitted.
6.1.1.10. PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS TO CITY
COMMISSION. The petition shall be deemed to be dated and the matter
submitted to the Planning Commission as of the date the petitioner requests
preparation of such recommendations. Such recommendations shall include
findings:
6.1.1.10.1. As to the suitability of the tract for the general type of PD
district proposed in terms of consistency with the City Comprehensive
Plan, physical characteristics of the land and its relation to the
surrounding area and existing and probable future development;
6.1.1.10.2. As to relation to major transportation facilities, utilities, public
facilities and services and compliance with the Concurrency
Management System;
6.1.1.10.3. As to adequacy of evidence of unified control and suitability of
any proposed agreements, contracts, deed restrictions, sureties or
other instruments, or the need for such instruments or for
amendments in those proposed;
6.1.1.10.4. As to the suitability of preliminary plans or the desirability of
amendments; and
6.1.1.10.5. As to desirable specific modifications in PD or general
regulations as applied to the particular case, based on determination
that such modifications are necessary or are justified in the particular
case upon demonstration that the public purposes of PD or general
regulations as applied in the particular case would be met to at least
an equivalent degree by such modifications.
6.1.1.10.6. Based on such findings, the Planning Commission shall
recommend approval of the PD amendment as proposed; approval
conditioned on stipulated modifications; or disapproval.
LDR 6 - 10
6.1.1.11. ACTION BY CITY COMMISSION.
6.1.1.11.1. On petition for PD amendments, the City Commission shall
proceed in general as provided for in other zoning district
amendments. The City Commission may grant the petition in accord
with PD and general regulations, may include recommended specific
modifications of the PD or general regulations as recommended by
the Planning Commission, or may deny the petition. If proposed action
is substantially at variance with Planning Commission
recommendations, such proposed changes shall be referred to the
Planning Commission for review and report prior to final City
Commission action. Unless the Planning Commission reports within
30 days of such referral, or such longer period as may be set in the
case by the City Commission, if agreed to by the petitioner, the City
Commission may proceed to final action without further delay.
6.1.1.11.2. If the City Commission grants the amendment, in any form, the
development shall be required to be in accord with final plans meeting
the requirements of this Chapter, as specifically supplemented or
modified by the City Commission in the particular case, and shall
conform to time limitations established by the City Commission on
beginning and completion of the development as a whole or in
specified stages or phases.
6.1.1.11.3. Before development may proceed, agreements, contracts,
deed restrictions and sureties shall be in form approved by
appropriate officers or agencies involved in the review process. The
City Commission may, in its amending action, approve preliminary
plans in whole or in part or may indicate required changes, and such
approval or requirements shall be binding in determinations
concerning final development plans.
6.1.1.12. APPROVAL OF FINAL PLANS.
6.1.1.12.1. After lands are rezoned to PD status, no building permit, or
certificate of occupancy shall be issued in such districts unless and
until the City staff shall have reviewed final plans and reports for the
development as a whole or stages or portions thereof deemed
satisfactory in relation to total development. No structure or use other
than as indicated in approved final plans and reports shall be
permitted.
6.1.1.12.2. Approval of final plans and reports shall be based on
compliance with regulations applying at the time the land was zoned
to PD status, including such specific modifications as made by the
LDR 6 - 11
City Commission in the amending action or, at the option of applicant,
in accordance with regulations currently in effect. Upon approval of
final plans and reports, building permits are to be issued in the same
manner as for building permits generally, provided that any
requirements concerning the order or location in which building
permits are to be issued in the particular PD district shall be observed.
Except as provided below, final plans and reports approved shall be
binding on the petitioner and any successors in interest so long as PD
zoning applies to the land.
6.1.1.13. PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION FOLLOWING REZONING TO PD
STATUS.
6.1.1.13.1. Changes in approved final plans. Minor changes may be
permitted by the Planning Commission or its duly authorized agent on
petition by the original petitioner or successors in interest, but only on
a finding that such changes are in accord with all applicable
regulations in effect at the time the final plan was approved and the
general intent and purpose of the City Comprehensive Plan in effect at
such time; provided, that the petitioner may elect to proceed in accord
with the City Comprehensive Plan currently in effect. Changes other
than as indicated above shall be made only by new PD or other
amendments.
6.1.1.13.2. Advertised Public hearings permissible but not mandatory in
connection with final plans. Action in connection with approval of final plans
or changes in approved plans not requiring amendments are administrative,
and do not require public notice and hearing but the Planning Commission
may hold such hearings as it deems desirable in connection with such
action.
6.1.1.14. TIME LIMITS ON PD AMENDMENTS.
6.1.1.14.1. Establish time limits on beginning and completion of the development
as a whole or in specified stages. Unless otherwise specified or extended
by the City Commission, development of a PD District shall begin and
proceed in good faith within one (1) year of the date of approval.
6.1.1.14.2. If development actions required in the amendment are not taken
within time limits set, the Planning Commission shall review the
circumstances and recommend to the City Commission that:
6.1.1.14.2.1. PD zoning for the entire area be continued with revised time
limits;
LDR 6 - 12
6.1.1.14.2.2. PD zoning be continued for part of the area with revised time
limits, and the remainder rezoned to a category in compliance with
the Comprehensive Plan; or
6.1.1.14.2.3. The entire area be rezoned from PD to a category in
compliance with the Comprehensive Plan.
6.1.1.14.3. Such recommendations shall include proposals for appropriate action
in respect to any legal instruments in the case.
Sec. 6.1.2. LAND USE INTENSITY (LUI).
6.1.2.1. RELATION OF LUI TO REGULATIONS.
6.1.2.1.1. Land use intensity (LUI) ratings herein established shall determine
certain requirements and regulations in PD districts, including minimum lot
area, gross floor area permitted, minimum open space and off-street parking
required, and related matters.
6.1.2.1.2. Terms used in calculations:
Land use intensity: (LUI) maximum development potential of site.
Minimum lot area (MLA) for application of maximum land use
intensities.
Minimum lot width: (MLW)
Floor area ratio: (FAR)
Open Space ratio: (OSR)
Car ratio: (off-street parking spaces (CR) per dwelling unit)
6.1.2.1.3. Maximum residential floor area and minimum open space
(including living space and recreation space) and off-street parking
space shall be determined by the ratios in areas with the LUI ratings
as indicated below.
6.1.2.1.4. Floor area ratio and population density limitations.
6.1.2.1.4.1. Except as provided below, the floor area ratio, multiplied
by gross land area (in square feet) of private property within
the PD district, plus additions as indicated below, indicates the
maximum number of square feet of floor area permitted.
6.1.2.1.4.2. For purposes of this Chapter, floor area is defined as
including floor area within buildings, or roofed and enclosed on
LDR 6 - 13
at least 2 sides, but floor area designed and used for parking
shall be excluded from the limitation derived from application of
the floor area ratio.
6.1.2.1.5. Bonus computations.
6.1.2.1.5.1. In recognition of the benefits to residents of planned
developments of certain major open spaces adjoining them, an
off-site open space bonus may be added to the area of all
planned development districts established adjacent to, or
adjacent with only an intervening street, to lakes, major streets
with a minimum right-of-way of 100 feet, and parks and any
other permanent open space with a minimum of 100 feet of
depth parallel to subject property. Within the boundaries of the
Auburndale Green Swamp Protection Area bonus
computations shall not increase densities beyond that which is
allowed by policy and underlying land use. Such bonus shall be
computed as follows:
6.1.2.1.5.1.1. Determine the number of feet in a straight line
connecting the boundaries of the district where it faces
the bodies of water indicated, with or without an
intervening street, or faces on the major street, park and
other permanent open space.
6.1.2.1.5.1.2. Multiply this number of feet times the district LUI
rating to determine the number of square feet to be
added to the existing area of property under
development.
6.1.2.1.5.2. Such bonus shall be included in the computation of floor
area limitations and in requirements for total open space as set
forth below. It shall be included in requirements for livability
space only if the district boundary adjoins the water area (or
park, etc.) without an intervening street.
6.1.2.1.6. Open space and livability space limitations.
6.1.2.1.6.1. The open space ratio and the livability space ratio
multiplied by gross land area (exclusive of that designed and
used for parking, as indicated above) establish the minimum
number of square feet of total open space which shall be
required.
LDR 6 - 14
6.1.2.1.6.2. Total open space shall be computed to include the gross
land area of the district (including any bonus) minus area
covered by buildings, and retention/detention areas.
6.1.2.1.7. Car ratio: off-street parking requirements. Parking space
sufficient for residents and guests shall be provided. Additional spaces
may be required where recreational facilities in the development are
so located or of such a nature as to require additional parking. In no
case shall there be less than 2 parking spaces provided for each
dwelling
6.1.2.2. APPLICATION OF LAND USE INTENSITY RATINGS.
6.1.2.2.1. LUI ratings shall be consistent with the underlying future land
use as shown on the Future Land Use Map in the Comprehensive
Plan. Within the boundaries of the Auburndale Green Swamp
Protection Area LUI computations shall not increase residential
densities, impervious surface ratios, or floor area ratios beyond that
which is allowed by the underlying future land uses and policies in the
Comprehensive Plan. Their intended use and the application of their
respective ratios are as follows:
6.1.2.2.1.1. LUI 36 - Low density land use - as applied to residential
land use, maximum density permitted: 6 dwelling units per net
acre.
Minimum lot area for application of maximum
land use intensities ............................... 4 acres
Minimum lot width ............................................ 200 feet
Floor area ratio (FAR) ......................................... 0.152
Open space ratio (OSR) ........................................ 0.78

spaces per dwelling unit or in the
case of PD-C or PD-I uses as required
therein.) ........................................................ 2.0
6.1.2.2.1.2. LUI 43 - Low to medium density land use - as applied to
residential land use, maximum density permitted: 14 dwelling
units per net acre.
Minimum lot area for application of
maximum land use intensities .............. 4 acres
Minimum lot width ............................................ 200 feet
Floor area ratio (FAR) ......................................... 0.246
Open space ratio (OSR) ........................................ 0.75
LDR 6 - 15
Car ratio (off-street parking spaces
per dwelling unit or in the case
PD-C or PD-I uses as required
therein.) ........................................................ 2.0
6.1.2.2.1.3. LUI 55 - Medium to high density land use - as applied to
residential land use, maximum density permitted: 15 to 30
dwelling units per net acre.
Minimum lot area for application of
maximum land use intensities ................ 4 acres
Minimum lot width ............................................ 200 feet
Floor area ratio (FAR) ......................................... 0.566
Open space ratio (OSR) ........................................ 0.71
Car ratio (off-street parking
spaces per dwelling unit or in
the case of PD-C or PD-I uses required
therein.) ........................................................ 2.0
6.1.2.2.2. The underlying zoning classification will continue to apply to the
lands within the corporate limits of the City at the time of adoption of
these provisions and until the Planned Development provisions are
applied to a specific site in accordance with the requirements
contained in this Chapter. Lands later annexed into the City will be
designated with a zoning classification at the time of annexation upon
agreement with the property owners in conformance with the City
Comprehensive Plan.
6.1.2.2.3. Application of above ratios.
Except as indicated otherwise, LUI ratings and application of ratios
and related measurements and requirements shall be as provided in
the following formulas:
FAR x GLA (actual lot area + bonuses) = maximum permitted
floor area.
GLA x OSR = maximum permitted floor area.
CR x number of dwelling units =
minimum number of off-street parking spaces.
6.1.2.2.4. Supplemental diagrams and explanation for LUI ratings and
application of respective ratios are as shown on the following pages.
All land areas used in these examples are minimum permissible.

Sec. 6.1.3. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT - HOUSING 1 DISTRICTS, PD-H1
6.1.3.1. The following regulations and requirements apply to large scale
planned developments primarily for housing but with accompanying related
services:
6.1.3.1.1. Planned development - Housing 1, PD-H1, defined. A PD-H1 is
defined for the purposes of this Chapter as;
6.1.3.1.1.1. A planned development (as defined generally in
6.1.1.3.) primarily for dwellings and related uses, services and
facilities;
6.1.3.1.1.2. A large parcel of land of not less than 50 acres projected
for development as a totally planned community over a time
span of not less than 5 years;
6.1.3.1.1.3. To which the procedures normally associated with
conventional planned developments of smaller scale and size
cannot be practically applied.
6.1.3.1.2. Permitted principal and accessory uses. Since the plan to be
submitted is a preliminary one, uses permitted for concept purposes,
but not for purposes of actual construction shall include dwellings,
which may be single family detached, two family detached, semidetached
or attached, and/or multi-family and residential designed
manufactured housing (RDMH). Additional uses permitted shall
include those uses which are customarily incidental to and a
necessary aspect of residential facilities such as churches, schools,
recreational facilities, neighborhood commercial establishments not
exceeding 5% of the gross land area, governmental structures such
as fire and police stations, and similar uses. Kennels shall be
prohibited.
6.1.3.1.3. Requirements, limitations, and standards. Because the PD-H1
district is designed for preliminary planning of large scale
developments with final completion of construction requiring a long
time period, the requirements, limitations, and standards herein set
out are general in character.
6.1.3.1.3.1. The underlying future land use as shown on the Future
Land Use Map in the Comprehensive Plan will determine the
LUI to be established for the particular proposed amendment.
Overall maximum permitted floor area (including residential and
LDR 6 - 26
customarily incidental uses) for the PD-H1 district shall be
determined by the LUI rating applied to the land area included
in the proposed amendment except as provided herein.
6.1.3.1.3.2. LUI ratings herein established shall determine certain
other requirements and regulations in PD-H1 districts, including
minimum lot area, minimum open space and off-street parking
required and related matters.
6.1.3.1.3.3. Maximum residential and customarily incidental uses,
floor area and minimum open space and off-street parking
space shall be determined by the ratios in areas with the LUI
ratings as indicated in 6.1.2.2. Within the boundaries of the
Auburndale Green Swamp Protection Area LUI computations
shall not increase floor area ratios beyond that which is allowed
by the Comprehensive Plan and the underlying future land use
as shown on the Future Land Use Map in the City of
Auburndales Comprehensive Plan.
6.1.3.1.4. Site planning, external relationships. Concept planning within
the proposed PD-H1 district shall provide protection of the
development from adverse or potentially adverse surrounding or
nearby influences, and protection of surrounding areas from adverse
or potentially adverse influences within the district. Vehicular access to
and from the proposed development shall be shown, with special
attention to types of thoroughfare access to existing or proposed
public street systems.
6.1.3.1.5. Preservation and protection of desirable natural features,
protection against erosion by wind or water. Planning and
development shall preserve and protect desirable natural features and
protect against environmental damage. In particular, desirable existing
trees and other vegetation shall be preserved, and along the water
fronts, the disturbance of terrain or vegetation in a way which is likely
to increase water erosion within or adjacent to the district shall be
prohibited.
6.1.3.1.6. Site planning, internal relationships. The concept plans shall
demonstrate a safe, convenient access to dwelling units and other
facilities, and for appropriate relationships among varieties of housing
types and the use of space inside and outside of structures. The
concept plan should demonstrate how vehicular and pedestrian traffic
is proposed to be separated, how minimum land areas are used for
access, how traffic through the development will be controlled,
discouraged, or prevented and that the proposed development will be
an efficient use of land and natural amenities.
LDR 6 - 27
6.1.3.1.7. Petitions and materials for PD-H1 zoning - See Sec. 6.1.1.6.
6.1.3.1.8. Effect of PD-H1 zoning.
6.1.3.1.8.1. No building permit for residential or commercial
construction shall be issued for lands zoned PD-H1 until all
applicable conditions contained within this Article are met.
Within the boundaries of the Auburndale Green Swamp
Protection Area, Planned Development zoning classifications
shall only take effect upon receipt of Final Order issued by
the Department of Economic Opportunity or Administration
Commission finding the Planned Development amendment is
in compliance with Florida Statutes. Construction permits for
roads, utilities, open space, facilities not involving structures for
human habitation, and similar uses may be issued and
construction undertaken for lands in PD-H1 classification,
subject to plans for such types of construction meeting all
applicable City land development codes, and provided further
that sureties or bonds for completion of construction, where
required by other City codes or ordinances, have been
tendered and the City has accepted such sureties or bonds.
6.1.3.1.8.2. Detailed phased or total development plans for lands
zoned PD-H1 shall be required to be reviewed for
recommendations and approval by the Planning Commission
with final approval required by the City Commission prior to any
building permits being issued. All such detailed plans shall be
in accord and agreement with final concept plans and materials
submitted as a part of the PD-H1 amendment. If such detailed
plans are in compliance with the above referenced conditions
the Planning Commission and City Commission shall grant
approval of the plans.
6.1.3.1.8.3. Materials required for submission as phasing of
development begins shall be as for PD generally and as for
PD-H2 and PD-C as applicable with the provisions therein
governing plan design, land uses and related performance
requirements.
6.1.3.1.9. Changes in PD-H1.
6.1.3.1.9.1. Changes in large scale, long range projects become
inevitable, necessary for a variety of justifiable causes -
economic, social, or demographic. The PD-H1 district is
designed for conceptual approval by the City. It is not intended
that the concepts approved shall be inflexibly applied in detail
but rather that the eventual overall development shall conform
in concept to the plans as approved at time of rezoning to PDLDR
6 - 28
H1, to the end that changes in the concept plan will not be
necessary.
6.1.3.1.9.2. Where the owner of land in the PD-H1 district deems it
necessary however to seek a change in the concept plan as
approved at the time of PD-H1 amendment, he may initiate
such change for all, or a portion of not less than 10 acres, of
such PD-H1 land. Procedurally, such change shall be handled
as for a zoning district amendment and if such request for
change in the concept plan is approved it shall then replace
that applicable portion or the entirety of the concept plan
approved at the time of original PD-H1 amendment. Such
amendments shall not be required to meet the amendment
timing requirements of Sec. 21.1.7. of the Land Development
Regulations.
6.1.3.1.10. The Auburndale Green Swamp Protection Area: The PD-H1 zoning
classification within the boundaries of the Auburndale Green Swamp Protection Area
shall only allow single family residential development at a density of 0-3 units per
acre, including any fraction thereof, with central water and paved road access. Per
Policy 11.8 of the City of Auburndale Comprehensive Plan, single family lots shall
not exceed an impervious surface ratio of 50%. If the lots are within a master
planned residential community, the overall Impervious Surface Ratio shall be 50%.
Sec. 6.1.4. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT - HOUSING 2 DISTRICTS, PD-H2.
6.1.4.1. The following regulations and requirements apply to small scale
planned developments primarily for housing:
6.1.4.1.1. Planned Development - Housing 2, PD-H2 defined. A PD-H2 is
defined for the purposes of this Chapter as a planned development
(as defined generally in 6.1.1.3.) primarily for dwellings and related
uses and facilities and containing not less than 4 acres of land area.
6.1.4.1.2. PD-H2 districts, where permitted. PD-H2 districts may hereafter
be established within areas currently classified Residential in the Land
Use Element of the City Comprehensive Plan by amendments to the
official zoning map in accordance with the provisions set forth
generally for PD districts in 6.1.1.3. above.
6.1.4.1.3. Permitted principal and accessory uses. Principal uses
permitted shall include dwellings, including residential design
manufactured homes (RDMH), which may be single family or twofamily
detached, semidetached or attached, and/or multi-family,
churches, schools, parks and playgrounds and governmental
structures. Manufactured housing development, containing RDMH
and Standard Design Manufactured Homes (SDMH) shall be
permitted provided however that all residential lots on the perimeter of
LDR 6 - 29
the district shall contain only RDMH manufactured homes meeting all
appearance criteria.
Accessory uses permitted shall include only those which are
customarily accessory and incidental to residential developments.
Floor area devoted to accessory uses other than parking shall not
exceed 10% of residential floor area, and provided that in planned
residential developments having 100 or more dwelling units,
establishments for sale of convenience goods, personal and
professional service establishments, and eating and drinking
establishments shall be permitted as accessory uses. Such
establishment shall be designed and scaled to meet only the
requirements of occupants of dwelling units in the planned
development and their guests, and there shall be no external evidence
of such establishments visible from outside the planned development.
Kennels shall be prohibited.
6.1.4.1.4. Density. Maximum residential density is regulated by the LUI
rating scale and the provisions of 6.1.2.2. The LUI sector overlay on
the zoning map will determine the LUI to be established for the land
area of the particular proposed amendment.
6.1.4.1.5. Site planning external relationships. Site planning within the
district shall provide protection of the development from potentially
adverse surrounding influences, and protection of surrounding areas
from potentially adverse influences within the district. In particular:
6.1.4.1.5.1. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to
encourage smooth traffic flow and minimum hazards to
vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turn-out lanes
and/or traffic dividers shall be required where existing or
anticipated heavy traffic flows indicate need. In general, minor
streets shall not be connected with minor streets outside the
district in such a way as to encourage through traffic, or flow of
traffic from the district along minor streets in neighboring
residential areas.
6.1.4.1.5.2. Uses adjacent to conventional single family residential
developments. Where a PD-H2 district adjoins a single family
residential development without intervening permanent open
space at least 100 feet in width serving as separation for
buildable areas, the portion of the district so adjoining shall be
planned and developed only for uses permitted in the adjoining
residential development except as provided for herein and in
accordance with all other requirements for the district.
A second option in lieu of such common boundary
development, shall be the provision of open space for the
LDR 6 - 30
district with a minimum depth of 25 feet between the common
zoning district boundaries may be permitted. No intensive
recreational use or off-street parking shall be permitted in this
open space setback area. Such area may be required to be
maintained in landscaping including trees, shrubs, ground
covers and grass for a minimum depth of 10 feet.
A third option available to the developer is the provision of a
solid screening material such as a wooden fence or block wall,
each of which shall be 6 feet in height and placed a minimum
of 10 feet from the property line. The 10 foot setback area
between the zoning district boundary and the solid screening
shall be grassed and landscaped and maintained in good
condition at all times. Such areas shall be undeveloped other
than landscaping, contain no accessory buildings and treated
as front yards for the district.
6.1.4.1.5.3. Fences, walls, or vegetative screening within and at the
edges of PD-H2 districts shall be provided where needed to
protect residents from undesirable views, lighting, noise or
other adverse off-site influences, or to protect residents of
adjoining properties from similar adverse influences within the
district. In both cases, screening shall at a minimum be
designed to protect from existing or potential first floor
residential window levels. In particular, parking areas for five or
more cars, service areas for loading or unloading vehicles
other than passengers, and areas for storage and collection of
trash and garbage shall be so screened.
6.1.4.1.5.4. Height limitations at edges of PD-H2 districts. Except
along boundaries where adjoining districts permit greater
heights within similar areas, or where the district adjoins, with
or without an intervening street, a waterway or other
permanent open space at least 100 feet in width, in addition to
the height limitations applying generally within PD-H2 districts,
the following shall apply: No portion of any structure within the
district shall project through imaginary planes leaning inward
from district boundaries at an angle representing an increase of
one foot in height for each 2 feet of horizontal distance and
shall not exceed a maximum of 35 feet in height above grade
except upon making provisions to install approved automatic
sprinkler system.
6.1.4.1.5.5. Sign limitations. One permanent identification sign, not
exceeding 20 sq. ft. in area, may be erected at each principal
entrance to the planned development district. During the
process of development, the Planning Commission may permit

special circumstances justify such reductions, and that other
requirements can be met in such lesser areas.
6.1.4.1.9.2. Greater areas than those generally required may be
recommended to the City Commission for PD-H2 zoning upon
findings by the Planning Commission in a particular case that
the plan of development as proposed, or the characteristics of
the property involved, in themselves or in relation to
environmental circumstances, require such increase to meet
the requirements and intent of PD-H2 zoning and provide an
efficient use of land or to provide necessary special
protections.

district may be considered as an extension of any other commercial
LDR 6 - 41
zoning district for purposes of meeting minimum area rezoning
requirements.
6.1.6.2.2. Creation of PD-C2 districts will be permitted where limited retail
commercial services and related uses are appropriate and will serve
neighborhoods and areas not already conveniently and adequately
provided with limited retail commercial and service facilities of the kind
proposed. It is intended to permit the establishment of such districts
only where limited retail commercial services and related uses are
placed within a cluster of organized buildings, service and parking
areas, and open space will serve clearly demonstrated public need,
minimize traffic congestion and points of conflict below that which
would result from lot by lot commercial development along
thoroughfares, and encourage stability and protect property values m
surrounding neighborhoods.
6.1.6.3. PERMITTED PRINCIPAL AND ACCESSORY USES.
6.1.6.3.1. Restrictions on uses. In order to preserve the essential

appropriate in a commercial district, consistent with the
provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and that such PD-C2
approval shall contain a time frame for such nonconforming
use or uses to be terminated and changed to a conforming use
or uses. When a petition is submitted as provided for in this

ARTICLE 2. CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT
Sec. 6.2.1. PURPOSE.
6.2.1.1. PURPOSE. The purpose of this Article is to permit a development
procedure providing for modifications of minimum yard, lot area and open
space requirements allowing for the grouping of structures pursuant to a
development plan. Such arrangements will promote more economic
development of land, encourage residential dwelling variety, provide for
creativity and originality in total subdivision and individual site design and
permits preservation of open space to serve recreational, scenic and related
public purposes.
6.2.1.2. APPLICATION OF THESE PROVISIONS. These developments shall
be permitted in residential zoning districts after city staff site plan review and
recommendations, Planning Commission recommendations and City
Commission approval. No advertised public hearings shall be required for
such reviews and approvals. All requirements herein and all other applicable
requirements of Chapter 13 of the LDR shall be met by the developer.
For purposes of this Article, wherever the requirements of this Article are at
variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules,
regulations or chapters, the requirements of this Article shall govern.
6.2.1.3. DEFINITION.
6.2.1.3.1. Cluster development. A subdivision of land permitting lots
generally smaller in area and width than the minimum required in the
zoning district in which the parcel is located with no increase in density
LDR 6 - 68
and where the surplus land is put into common use, generally in the
form of open space.
6.2.1.3.2. Zero lot line dwelling. A single family detached dwelling
whereby the structure is permitted to be built up to one or both of the
side property lines. A solid wall, with no windows or doors, shall be

at the rear of the required front yard and continuing to the front of the
required rear yard. That portion of such zero lot line walls situated
between dwellings shall be constructed to 2 hour fire wall
requirements as specified in the building code of the City.
6.2.1.4. TRANSFER OF DENSITY - LOT REDUCTIONS. In residential districts
permitting cluster developments, the minimum lot area and width may be
reduced from that generally applicable in the district by as much as 40
percent in such cluster subdivisions. All lot area reduction amounts shall be
combined to form an equivalent land area in clustered open space to be
preserved and maintained for recreation, conservation, scenic or related
purposes.
6.2.1.4.1. Minimum yard requirements in cluster subdivisions may be
reduced but in no case shall they be less than the following
dimensions for all districts:
Front: 20 feet
Side: If provided, 8 feet, however one or both side yards may be
reduced to zero feet subject to zero lot line definition provisions.
Rear: 20 feet
6.2.1.4.2. Yards in all lots on the perimeter of the cluster development
site shall not be less than minimum requirements for the district.
Additionally, the front yard setback for all lots fronting on public streets
shall not be less than the front yard setback requirements of the
district.
6.2.1.4.3. In the approval of a cluster development, in no case shall the
maximum density of the district be increased, nor shall the other
applicable regulations or use restrictions for the district be modified or
changed.
6.2.1.4.4. Within the boundaries of the Auburndale Green Swamp
Protection Area transfer of densities shall be according to
Development Criteria within the Auburndale Green Swamp Protection
Area of the citys Comprehensive Plan, Development regulations shall
permit densities to be transferred from Environmentally Sensitive
LDR 6 - 69
Lands to adjacent non-environmentally sensitive property under the
same ownership or control subject to the following:
1. Transfers shall be at a density not to exceed one dwelling
unit per 20 acres (1du/20ac);
2. Transfers shall only be permitted within a subdivision platted
and developed in accordance to the Citys Land Development
Regulations;
3. Transfers shall not result in lot sizes per dwelling unit less than 14,520 sf.
6.2.1.5. MINIMUM SIZE OF CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT. 4 Acres.
6.2.1.6. OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS. Open space in a cluster
development shall be equivalent to the total land area reduction in lot sizes
but in no case shall it be less than one acre.
6.2.1.6.1. The land set aside as open space shall be provided in such a
manner that it is usable for recreation, active and/or passive, or other
activities and is accessible to all residents of the subdivision or, where

6.2.1.6.2. If cluster open space is to be dedicated for public use it shall be
protected by legal covenants, satisfactory to the City Commission and
City Attorney, sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation for
whatever purpose it is intended. If open space is to remain private,
then covenants or other legal arrangements shall specify ownership of
the cluster open space; method of maintenance; responsibility for
maintenance; maintenance taxes and insurance; compulsory
membership and assessment provisions; guarantees that any
association formed to own and maintain cluster open space shall not
be dissolved without the consent of the City Commission after review
by the City Attorney.
6.2.1.7. REVIEW CRITERIA. In reviewing cluster development site plans, the
City Staff shall use the following criteria in addition to the above standards to
determine if the particular petition qualifies for approval:

referred to as RDMH, are new manufactured homes approved
as meeting "residential design" standards contained herein and
constructed after July 1, 1985.
LDR 6 - 71
6.3.1.1.2.2. Standard design manufactured homes, hereinafter
referred to as SDMH, are manufactured homes certified as
meeting the HUD standards or manufactured homes certified
as meeting prior codes, and found on inspection to be in
excellent condition and safe and fit for continued residential
occupancy, but in both cases not approved as meeting
"residential design" standards contained herein.
6.3.1.1.3. Foundation. The site built supporting parts upon which the
manufactured home is placed, whether constructed to encompass the

6.3.1.2. RESIDENTIAL DESIGN MANUFACTURED HOME (RDMH), INTENT:
EFFECT OF APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
6.3.1.2.1. Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to encourage the provision
of affordable housing in a general residential environment by
permitting the use of RDMH as defined herein, in residential districts
in which similar dwellings constructed on the site are permitted,
subject to the requirements and procedures set forth herein to assure
LDR 6 - 72
similarity and compatibility in exterior appearance between such
RDMH and dwellings which have been constructed under these and
other lawful regulations on adjacent lots in the same district.
6.3.1.2.2. Effect of approval of RDMH, limitations. Manufactured homes
approved as RDMH, either individually or by specific model, shall be
permitted in residential districts in which similar residential occupancy
is permitted, subject to requirements and limitations applying generally
to such residential use in the districts, including minimum lot, yard and
building spacing, percentage of lot coverage, off-street parking
requirements and subject to the following additional requirements and
limitations:
6.3.1.2.2.1. Approved foundations required in residential districts.
Where approval of homes or model plans does not also include
approval of type of foundation, no RDMH shall be placed or
occupied for residential use on a site in a residential district
until such foundation plans have been submitted to and
approved by the Administrative Official. Such approval shall be
based upon the appearance and durability of the proposed
foundation and its being acceptably similar or compatible in
appearance to foundations of residences built or located on
adjacent or nearby sites.
6.3.1.2.3. Determination by Administrative Official
6.3.1.2.3.1. Applications for approval of manufactured homes as
RDMH shall be submitted to the Administrative Official in such
form as may reasonably be required to make determinations.
In particular, in addition to such information as is generally
required for permits and is as necessary for administrative
purposes, such applications shall include all information
necessary to make determinations as to conformity with the
standards below, including elevations or photographs of all
sides of the manufactured home, exterior dimensions, roof
pitch, exterior finish, and related features.
6.3.1.2.3.2. Where there has been prior general approval of
foundations proposed to be used, as provided in the standards
below, detailed specifications or descriptions of such
foundations shall not be required. Where it is proposed to use
foundations not previously approved, specifications or
descriptions shall be supplied in sufficient detail for
determinations as provided in the standards below. Where type
of foundation to be used is unknown at the time of application
for RDMH determinations for models or individual
manufactured homes, approval as RDMH may be granted if
LDR 6 - 73
otherwise appropriate, but locations and use for residential
purposes shall be subject to limitations in 6.3.1.2. above.
6.3.1.2.4. Actions by Administrative Official; time limitations on
determinations; nature of determinations. Within 7 days of receipt of
the application and all required supporting materials, the
Administrative Official shall make the determination as to conformity
with the standards below, and shall notify the applicant of the
approval, conditional approval or denial of the application. Conditional
approval shall be granted only where the conditions and reasons
therefore are stated in writing and agreed to by the applicant, and
such conditions shall be binding upon the applicant. In the case of
disapproval, the reasons therefore shall be stated in writing.
6.3.1.2.5. Standards for determinations of similarity in exterior
appearance, RDMH. The following standards shall be used in
determinations of similarity in appearance between RDMH homes,
with foundations approved as provided in the subsection, and
compatible in appearance with site built housing which has been
constructed in adjacent or nearby locations. In addition to meeting the
following specific standards, no manufactured home to be approved
as RDMH shall have windows or other features, or use exterior colors
or color combinations, which would be incompatible in the general
residential neighborhood in which it is to be located.
6.3.1.2.5.1. Minimum width of main body. Minimum width of the
main body of the RDMH as located on the site shall not be less
than twenty feet, as measured across the narrowest portion.

home.
6.3.1.2.5.2. Minimum roof pitch; minimum roof overhang; roofing
materials. Minimum pitch of the main roof shall be not less than
2.5 feet to rise for each 12 feet of horizontal run and minimum
roof overhang shall be one foot. In cases where site built
housing generally has been constructed in adjacent or nearby
locations with roof pitches less than 1:3 and/or roof overhangs
are less than one foot, then the RDMH may have less roof
pitch and roof overhang similar to the site built houses. In
general, any roofing material, other than a built up composition
roof, may be used which is generally used for site built houses
in adjacent or nearby locations.
6.3.1.2.5.3. Exterior finish; light reflection. Any material may be used
for exterior finish which is generally acceptable for site built
housing which has been constructed in adjacent or nearby
locations, provided however that reflection for such exterior
LDR 6 - 74
shall not be greater than from siding coated with clean white
gloss exterior enamel.
6.3.1.2.5.4. Approval of foundation.
6.3.1.2.5.4.1. The Administrative Official may predetermine and
establish general approval for specific types, varieties or
designs of foundations and veneer or screening
materials to be used in connection with future
installation of a RDMH.
6.3.1.2.5.4.2. Such approval shall be based on determination
of similarity in appearance to foundations for housing
built on the site and on durability adequate to maintain
such appearance with proper maintenance.
6.3.1.2.5.4.3. Where approval is granted for foundations or
screening in connection with applications on individual
RDMH, the same type, variety or design shall thereafter
be construed to be generally approved.
6.3.1.2.5.4.4. If the Administrative Official shall find that a
specified type, variety or design of foundation and/or
screening which has been approved fails to maintain
acceptable appearance with proper maintenance he
shall order necessary corrections and/or shall suspend
or remove the type, variety or design from the general
approved listing, with reasons stated in writing.
6.3.1.2.5.5. Site orientation of the manufactured home. RDMH shall
be placed on lots in such a manner as to be compatible with
and reasonably similar in orientation to the site built housing
which has been constructed in adjacent or nearby locations.
6.3.1.2.5.6. Garages, carports. In residential neighborhoods where
adjacent to nearby site built homes includes garages and/or
carports, a RDMH shall be required to be provided with a
garage and/or carport compatible with the RDMH and the site
built garages and/or carports constructed in adjacent or nearby

CHAPTER 7. SIGNS
ARTICLE 1. GENERAL
Sec. 7.1.1. INTENT.
7.1.1.1. It is the intent of these regulations to permit, under reasonable control,
signs in certain areas of the City where such uses are compatible with the
activities, services or products being advertised or promoted. The provisions
of these regulations shall govern the number, sizes, location and character of
all signs which may be permitted as a principal or accessory use. No sign
shall be permitted on any lot or site except in conformance with these
provisions. Signs or other advertising structures shall be constructed and
maintained in accordance with the building and other applicable codes of the
City.
Sec. 7.1.2. NUMBER OF SIGNS AND SURFACE AREA.
7.1.2.1. For purposes of determining number of signs, a sign shall be
considered to be a single display surface or display device containing
elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. Where matter is
displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements, or
where there is reasonable doubt about the relationship of elements, each
element shall be considered to be a single sign.
The surface area of a sign shall be computed as including the entire area
within a regular geometric form comprising all of the display area of the sign
and including all of the elements of the matter displayed. In the case of a
balloon sign, the entire surface of such device shall be used in calculating
the area considered to be a sign surface. Frames and structural members
not bearing advertising matter shall not be included in computation of surface
area. (See diagram on following page.) Where a sign has two or more
faces, the area of all faces shall be combined in determining the area of the
sign.

CHAPTER 8. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
ARTICLE 1. GENERAL
Sec. 8.1.1. PURPOSE.
The City is committed to the protection of environmental resources through the
adoption of the Comprehensive Plan and more specifically the adoption of the
Conservation Element of the Plan. Some of the issues addressed in this Element
include surface water, water wells, lakes, fisheries and wetlands. Other issues
contained in the Element are addressed as appropriate in other Chapters of the
Land Development Regulations. This Chapter provides the regulations necessary to
implement stormwater management systems, water well protection, impervious
surface coverage, and protection of lakes, wetlands, threatened or endangered
species habitat, conservation area, native ecological communities and water
shortages.
ARTICLE 2. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
Sec. 8.2.1. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.
8.2.1.1. Stormwater management systems shall be installed by the developer
which the City (consulting) engineer certifies as adequate to handle a
minimum rainfall of 5.5 inches per hour without damage to the facilities and
shall be governed by the City Drainage Plan. When existing off-site drainage
facilities would be adversely impacted by the proposed discharge, the
developer shall install and pay for such additional improvements as may be
required. Where additional capacity is required to handle the needs of the
general stormwater system of the City, costs of such extra capacity shall be
prorated between the developer and other interests in a manner acceptable
to the City.
8.2.1.2. Stormwater management systems shall be designed so that the peak
predevelopment discharge rate at the point of stormwater discharge is not
exceeded by the peak post-development rate during a 25 year - 24 hour
storm event, having a total rainfall of 8.5 inches as required by the Water
Management District (WMD). Detention and/or retention with filtration of the
???8 - 4
first ½ inch runoff or the runoff from the first inch of rainfall shall be provided
as required by Department of Environmental Regulation (DER).
8.2.1.3. All installations shall be in conformance with all applicable WMD and
DER rules. The developer shall furnish the City with approved stormwater
permits and/or exemptions prior to commencing any site work. However, if
the developer can produce written evidence to the City Staff demonstrating
that an accepted application to either or both of these agencies has been in
process for more than 120 days but with no permit issued, and in the opinion
of the City (consulting) engineer, all the developer's construction plans are in
order and meet the requirements of the Land Development Regulations, then
the City Commission may waive this requirement, if in their opinion the public
health, safety and welfare would not be impaired by such action.
8.2.1.4. If on-site retention with no positive outfall is to be provided, the
stormwater management system shall be designed to retain all runoff from a
100 year - 72 hour storm event (13.5 inches in a continuous 72 hour period)
without flooding of buildings. In addition, the plat or drainage plan shall
indicate that no positive outfall is provided and that, if applicable, some lots
may flood during extreme storm events.
8.2.1.5 Along with preliminary construction plans, a drainage plan and a
complete set of drainage calculations shall be provided the City for review by
the City (consulting) engineer. The drainage plan shall include all areas that
drain into, or through, the proposed subdivision or development and the
subdivision or development outfall system. The diameter, types, sizes, and
flow lines of all existing and proposed storm sewer and cross-drain pipes
shall be shown, along with the inlets and manholes. The drainage areas that
drain into each inlet shall be depicted, along with the drainage areas to the
nearest 1/10th of an acre and the "C" factor used. In addition, the drainage
plan shall indicate flood plain areas as indicated on the FEMA Maps,
locations and boundaries of wetland areas or waters of the State; locations
and results of soils borings and percolation tests; and an SCS soil map with
soil classifications and descriptions of characteristics.
8.2.1.6 All retention areas shall be designed based on a SCS Type II Florida
Modified storm distribution with antecedent moisture condition per WMD
regulations.
8.2.1.7 Cross drains shall be designed for a 10 year storm for minor cross
drains and collector road culverts and a 25 year storm for arterial road
culverts. All culverts and cross drains shall be designed so that under full
flow conditions, the hydraulic grade line is at least one foot below the gutter
profile. When pipes are sized based on partial depth flows, the depth of flow
shall be not more than 2/3 of the pipe diameter at velocities exceeding 15
???8 - 5
feet per second. All pipes shall be designed for a minimum velocity of 2.5
feet per second.
8.2.1.8 All construction shall be in accordance with City specifications and
standard details contained in the Administration and Procedures Manual and
all structures shall be in accordance with FDOT specifications. The storm
sewer system may empty into an existing storm sewer system or any other
outlet approved by the City (consulting) engineer at a rate not to exceed the
peak predevelopment rate. Overland flow over roadways shall not be
permitted.
8.2.1.9 Any new construction that is proposed to drain to a FDOT drainage
system shall be required to secure a FDOT drainage permit and submit such
to the Administrative Official prior to the issuance of a development order.
Sec. 8.2.2. SUBDRAINAGE.
8.2.2.1 Subdrainage facilities shall be required in "wet soil" areas if the City
(consulting) engineer determines that the bottom of any base material used
for foundations or streets would otherwise be less than one foot above
highest anticipated groundwater levels. Such decisions shall be based on
SCS soil surveys, wet season water table determined by field borings or area
history of flooding. Soil-cement base may be used in lieu of subdrains when
approved by the City (consulting) engineer. Subdrainage facilities shall
conform to FDOT specifications and standards.
Sec. 8.2.3. STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT
8.2.3.1. For enforcement purposes, the City has adopted by reference Polk
County Ordinance No. 93-06, Polk County Stormwater Management.
8.2.3.2. For enforcement purposes, the City has adopted a stormwater
management program.

receive an operating permit from the City which complies with the following
conditions:
8.3.4.1.1. Containment of regulated substances. Leakproof trays under
containers, floor curbing or other containment systems to provide
secondary liquid containment shall be installed. The containment
shall be of adequate size to handle all spills, leaks, overflows and
precipitation until appropriate action can be taken. The specific design
and selection of materials shall be sufficient to preclude any regulated
substance loss to the external environment. Containment systems
shall be sheltered so that the intrusion of precipitation is effectively
prevented. The owner/operator may choose to provide adequate and
appropriate liquid collection methods rather than a sheltering only
after approval of the design by the City Staff. These requirements
shall apply to all areas of use, production and handling; to all storage
areas; to loading and off-loading areas, and to above ground and
underground storage areas. The containment devices and liquid
collection systems shall be certified in the operating permit application
by the professional engineer registered or professional geologist
licensed in the state.

8.3.4.1.3. Emergency plan. An emergency plan shall be prepared and
filed with the operating permit application indicating the procedures
which will be followed in the event of spillage of a regulated substance
so as to control and collect all such spilled material in such a manner
as to prevent it from reaching any storm or sanitary drains or the
ground.
8.3.4.1.4. Inspection. A responsible person designated by the permittee
who stores, handles, uses or produces the regulated substances shall
check on every day of operation, for breakage or leakage of any
container holding the regulated substances. Electronic sensing
devices may be employed as part of the inspection process, if
approved by the department, and provided the sensing system is
checked daily for malfunctions. The manner of daily inspection shall
not necessarily require physical inspection of each container provided
the location of the containers can be inspected to a degree which
reasonably assures the City that breakage or leakage can be detected
by the inspection. Monitoring records shall be kept and made
available to the City at all reasonable times for examination.
8.3.4.1.5. Proper and adequate regular maintenance of containment and
emergency equipment. Procedures shall be established for the
quarterly in-house inspection and maintenance of containment and
emergency equipment. Such procedures shall be in writing, a regular

reported by telephone the County Health Department and the City
within 24 hours of discovery of the spill. Cleanup shall commence
immediately upon discovery of the spill. A full written report, including
the steps taken to contain and clean up the spill, shall be submitted to
the City within 15 days of discovery of the spill.
8.3.4.1.7. Monitoring for regulated substances in the potable water well.
Arrangements shall be made with the Public Works Department to
establish a semiannual schedule of raw water analysis unless
???8 - 12
sampling results indicate contamination, in which case the City shall
require an increased sampling schedule. The analysis shall be for all
substances which are listed on the operating permit. The analytical
reports shall be prepared by a state-certified laboratory, certified for
the applicable analyses. It shall be the responsibility of the Public
Works Department to provide for the sampling and analyses.
Samples shall be taken by the state-certified laboratory performing the
analyses, or its authorized representative. A reference set of raw
water analyses shall be completed for each well for which a cone of
influence line has been established. These analyses shall be
completed within 185 days after the effective date of the LDR, and a
copy shall be forwarded to the Administrative Official within 14 days of
completion. These analyses shall address inorganic priority pollutants
and organic priority pollutants. The analytical reports shall be
prepared by the state-certified laboratory, certified for the applicable
analyses.
8.3.4.1.8. Monitoring for regulated substances in groundwater monitoring
wells. Groundwater monitoring well(s) shall be provided in a manner,
number and location approved by the City. Except for existing wells
found by the City to be adequate for this provision, the required well or
wells shall be installed by the state-licensed water well contractor.
Samples shall be taken by the state certified laboratory performing the
analyses, or its authorized representative. Analytical reports prepared
by a state-certified laboratory of the quantity present in each
monitoring well of the regulated substances listed in the activity's
operating permit shall be filed at least annually, or more frequently, as
determined by the department, based upon site conditions and
operations.
8.3.4.1.9. Alterations and expansion. The City shall be notified in writing
prior to the expansion, alteration or modification of an activity holding
an operating permit. Such expansion, alteration or modification may
result from increased square footage of production or storage
capacity, or increased quantities of regulated substances, or changes
in types of regulated substances beyond those square footages,
quantities and types upon which the permit was issued. Excluded
from notification prior to alteration or modification are changes in types
of regulated substances listed in the permit based upon the generic
substance list as Chapter 11 of the Administration and Procedures
Manual. Should a facility add new regulated substances which
individually are below the nonaggregate limits, it shall notify the City
on the annual basis of the types and quantities of such substances
added and the location of the use, handling, storage and production of
said substances. Any such expansion, alteration or modification shall
???8 - 13
be in strict conformity with this Article. Further, except as provided
herein, any existing operating permit shall be amended to reflect the
introduction of any new regulated substances resulting from the
change. However, the introduction of any new regulated substance
shall not prevent the revocation or revision of any existing operating
permit if, in the opinion of the City, such introduction substantially or
materially modifies, alters or affects the conditions upon which the
existing operating permit was granted or the ability to remain qualified
as a general exemption, if applicable, or to continue to satisfy any
conditions upon which the existing operating permit was granted or
the ability to remain qualified as a general exemption, if applicable, or
to continue to satisfy any conditions that have been imposed as part
of a special exemption, if applicable. The City shall notify the
permittee in writing within 60 days of receipt of the permittee's notice
that the City proposes to revoke or revise the permit and stating the
grounds therefore.

of a structure or building in which there is any activity subject to the
provisions of this regulation which is damaged by fire, vandalism,
flood, explosion, collapse, wind, war or other catastrophe shall be in
strict conformity with this Article.
8.3.4.1.11. Operating permit. All existing nonresidential activities situated
in the cone of influence which use, handle, store or produce regulated
substances shall file an application for an operating permit within 90
days or a closure permit application or special exemption application
within 120 days of the receipt of written notice from the City. The
permit application shall be prepared and signed by a professional
geologist licensed by the State. Within 30 days of receipt of the
notice, the owner or operator shall file with the City proof of retention
of said engineer or geologist. If application is made for an operating
permit, such a permit shall be issued or denied within 60 days of filing
of the completed application. If the application for an operating permit
is denied, then the activity shall cease within 12 months of the denial
and an application for a closure permit shall be filed with the City
within 120 days of the denial of the operating permit.
8.3.4.2. OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND LIABILITIES. A notice to cease a
permit or exemption issued under this Article shall not relieve the owner or
operator of the obligation to comply with any other applicable federal, State,
regional or City regulation, rule, ordinance or requirement. Nor shall the
notice, permit or exemption relieve any owner or operator of any liability for
violation of such regulations, rules, ordinances or requirements.

ARTICLE 4. IMPERVIOUS SURFACES.
???8 - 21
Sec. 8.4.1. PURPOSE.
The City has determined, as a part of the Conservation Element of the
Comprehensive Plan, that it is necessary to protect the existing recharge capabilities
of the land areas within the corporate limits. The method utilized to implement this
objective is to regulate the amount of impervious surfaces permitted on a site in
order to provide for downward movement of water to replenish the aquifer.
Sec. 8.4.2. DEFINITION.
8.4.2.1. IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. A land surface which has been covered
with a layer of material(s) or compacted sufficiently so that it is incapable of
being penetrated or infiltrated by water. This material covering includes but is
not limited to, principal buildings, sidewalks, walkways, driveways, accessory
structures, pools and decks.
Sec. 8.4.3. PERCENT OF COVERAGE.
8.4.3.1. The maximum amount of impervious surface coverage for all land
uses that can be placed on upland soils is hereby established by zoning
district classifications as follows:
LF - Lake Front NA

or Florida Holly); or
10.6.7.1.3. Casuarina species (commonly known as Austrailian Pine); and
10.6.7.1.4. Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (commonly known as Downy Rose
Myrtle).
ARTICLE 7 - IRRIGATION DESIGN STANDARDS
Sec. 10.7.1. GENERAL.
For purposes of these guidelines, "permanent irrigation system" shall be defined as:
an assembly of component parts, above ground, underground or surface-mounted,
supplied with water under pressure through a system of permanently placed
irrigation piping, installed with and for the controlled distribution and conservation of
water for irrigating any type of landscape vegetation in any location within the City.
Water conservation methods are generally basic in nature but require that attention
be paid to the irrigation system, its operation and maintenance. These conservation
methods are not served when water is allowed to run down streets or sidewalks
during the irrigation process. A system that is turned on in the morning and allowed
to operate all day is completely wasteful of a most precious resource since most soil
conditions will not absorb a continuous application of water.
For greater efficiency all systems should be operated only at night or during early
morning hours. Systems that are operated during the heat of the day are totally
ineffective as the evapotranspiration rate is so high that the plant materials receive
no benefit. This same principle applies to windy days when an effective spray
pattern cannot be achieved. Systems operated just prior to sundown provide a
condition under which molds and other disease can be developed on all vegetation.
Drip irrigation systems are extremely effective in selected areas for water
conservation. These systems are generally effective in planter beds, parking islands
and boulevard medians, large areas of ground cover and similar planting areas.
These systems require special consideration since they cannot be operated on the
same zone as other types of sprinkler heads because they drip water on the basis of
gallons per hour as opposed to gallons per minute. These systems do require some
monitoring to assure that emitters and flow tubes are clean and undamaged.
Automatic rain shut off devices should be considered as a method of conserving
water. These devices allow continuation of the irrigation process during short,
LDR10 - 24
intermittent showers but will shut down an irrigation system or prevent it from
coming on if a predetermined amount of rain falls.
The only water supply for the system design other than potable or community water
supply shall be an irrigation well or an approved on-site lake or pond. The owner is
responsible for the water supply and its protection.
Sec. 10.7.2. DESIGN ELEMENTS AND CRITERIA.
10.7.2.1. IRRIGATION SYSTEMS installed within the City shall be designed in
a manner which will use sound water conservation principles and techniques
and will include the following:
10.7.2.1.1. The system shall be designed so as not to water any
impervious surfaces, i.e. sidewalks, streets, driveways or patios. A
finished design plan is required to show all manufactured components
of the working system and site features relevant to proper installation.
10.7.2.1.2. Automatic controls should be a part of the total irrigation
system and set with a watering schedule that will not exceed a
precipitation rate of 1 ½ to 2 inches per week.
10.7.2.1.3. The system should be regulated and operated in such a
manner as to prohibit any surface runoff from excessive watering.
10.7.2.1.4. Sprinkler selection shall be compatible with site conditions,
water source and water quality. The system should be designed to
not exceed a spacing of 55% of the specified radius of any given head
(i.e., 30 foot radius head should be spaced no farther than every 16.5
feet) and be based on established industry practices and plant water
requirements.
10.7.2.1.5. In turf or areas of low ground cover the system should use
underground pop-up sprinklers.
10.7.2.1.6. The system should contain separate watering zones based on
the types of sprinkler heads used and areas to be watered. For
example turf zones should not be on the same zone as shrubs or
planters, as turf requires more water. Likewise heads should not be
mixed i.e., spray heads and impacts, impacts and rotors, sprays and
bubblers due to the effectiveness and amounts of water that are used
by each type of head.
10.7.2.1.7. Main line and circuit line pipe shall conform to acceptable
ASAE hydraulic standards in regard to friction pressure loss and
LDR10 - 25
velocity of flow. The design water velocity in a pipeline, when
operating at system capacity, should not exceed 5 feet per second
unless special considerations are given to the control of surge or
water hammer and adequate protection from these pressures is
provided.
10.7.2.1.8. Pressure reducing valves shall be placed on lines where
sprinkler heads are installed with higher than factory specified
pressures. Sprinkler heads operated on higher than recommended
pressure usually mist and are ineffective.
10.7.2.1.9. A backflow prevention device shall be installed on all irrigation
systems connected to potable water sources as required by the LDR
and State law.
10.7.2.1.10.Cross Connections:
10.7.2.1.10.1. Because of the danger of contaminating potable
water supplies, the design and installation of irrigation systems
and yard sprinkler systems which incorporate connections to
alternate potable and nonpotable water supplies are not
recommended and are discouraged unless absolutely
necessary.
10.7.2.1.10.2. Schedule 40 pipe between the water meter and
backflow preventor is required.
10.7.2.1.10.3. Where an irrigation or yard sprinkler system is
designed to have alternate water supplies, a potable and
nonpotable water supply, an installer shall comply with one of
the following:
10.7.2.1.10.3.1. Provide for a complete absence of pipe
between the two water supplies (i.e., air gap);
10.7.2.1.10.3.2. Make no connection of the two water
supplies to each other; and
10.7.2.1.10.3.3. Make impossible the simultaneous
connection of both water supplies to the irrigation
system or yard sprinkler.
10.7.2.1.10.4. Any type of injector system requires a reduced
pressure backflow preventor.

CHAPTER 11. OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING, STORAGE.
ARTICLE 1. GENERAL.
Sec. 11.1.1. PURPOSE.
All developments within the City, except where expressly provided otherwise, shall
provide off-street parking spaces for the purpose of reducing on-street traffic
congestion, minimizing vehicular and pedestrian conflicts and generally to improve
traffic flow on public streets.
Sec. 11.1.2. APPLICATION.
11.1.2.1. Off-street parking facilities shall be provided as required by this
Chapter. For purposes of this Chapter, an off-street parking space shall
consist of a space adequate for parking a standard size automobile with
room for opening doors on both sides, together with properly related access
to a public street of alley and maneuvering room. Required off-street parking
areas for 3 or more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked, except
as provided below, and shall be so designed, maintained and regulated that
no parking or maneuvering incidental to parking shall be on any public street,
walk or alley, and in such a manner that any automobile may be parked and
unparked without moving another.
11.1.2.2. For purposes of rough computation an off-street parking space and
necessary access and maneuvering room shall be estimated at 400 sq. ft.
and the minimum width shall be 10 feet; however, off-street parking
requirements shall be considered to be met only where actual spaces
meeting the requirements above are provided and maintained and improved
in the manner required by this Chapter and in accordance with all other
regulations of the City.
11.1.2.3. Except as provided below, all off-street parking spaces, loading areas
and related access areas shall be constructed in accordance with Chapter
13, Subdivision Regulation construction requirements for minor streets and
maintained in a manner permitting safe and convenient use, and so as to
avoid adverse effects on neighboring property as a result of dust or drainage.
11.1.2.4. Driveways, access aisles, and parking spaces for public and private
schools offering academic courses, churches and other large noncommercial
areas of assembly may be surfaced with turf in areas involving
only occasional use, which shall be considered not in excess of an average
of 3 times per week.
LDR 11 - 4
11.1.2.5. When it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrative
Official that an alternate method of surfacing the parking and driving areas
meet the intent and requirements of more conventional surfacing methods,
then the Administrative Official may permit such improvements. However,
the burden of proof is on the developer and not the City to demonstrate that
the alternative method of surfacing parking areas exceeds asphalt or
concrete in the areas of stability, level of maintenance, wear and durability.
The applicable minimum requirements for minor streets contained in Chapter
7 if the APM shall be used as the standard upon which the alternative will
judged. Where City service and emergency are to have access, the roadway
shall be stabilized to accommodate such vehicles and approval must be
secured from the applicable department head for the requested alternative
method of surfacing. Examples of surfacing materials which may be used
are turf blocks, cypress mulch on compacted shell base and concrete.
Sec. 11.1.3. PARKING FOR EXISTING BUILDING OR USES.
11.1.3.1. Buildings existing as of the effective date of this Chapter may be
modernized, altered, repaired or expanded up to 10 percent of the existing
floor area at the time of permit petition without providing additional off-street
parking or off-street loading facilities. Any increase in the existing floor area
beyond the original allowable 10 percent, whether at the time of first petition
or any future petition shall cause the remaining applicable requirements of
this Chapter to be met.
11.1.2.2. Where a building or use existed as of the effective date of this Chapter
and such building or use is enlarged in floor area, volume, capacity or space
occupied, except as provided above, off-street parking and off-street loading
as herein specified shall be provided for the additional floor area, volume,
capacity or space so created or used,
11.1.2.3. Where change in use of a building or land requires additional parking
or loading spaces, such spaces shall be provided in addition to the number
existing for the prior use. Where the change in use decreases requirements,
only the number required for the new use need be maintained.
11.1.2.4. The required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same
lot or parcel of land they are intended to serve; provided, that the
Administrative Official may approve the establishment of such off-street
parking facilities a maximum of 400 feet from the premises they are intended
to serve when:
11.1.2.4.1. Practical difficulties prevent the placing of the facilities on the
same lot as the premises they are designed to serve;
LDR 11 - 5
11.1.2.4.2. The owner of the parking area shall enter into a written
agreement with the City, with enforcement running to the City
providing that the land comprising the parking area shall never be
disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building which
the parking area serves, so long as the facilities are required; and
11.1.2.4.3. Owner agrees to bear the expense of recording the agreement
with the Polk County Clerk of Court and agrees that the agreement
shall bind his heirs, successors and assigns. The written agreement
shall be released by the City if equivalent off-street facilities are
provided elsewhere in accord with this Chapter.
Sec. 11.1.4. PLANS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING.
Except for an individual single family detached dwelling on an individual lot, a plan
shall be submitted with every application for a building permit for any building or use
that is required to provide off-street parking. The plan shall accurately designate, by
dimensions the required parking spaces, access aisles and driveways, the relation
of off-street parking facilities to the uses or structures such facilities are designed to
serve and materials to be used for surfacing the parking area.
Sec. 11.1.5. COMBINED OFF-STREET PARKING.
11.1.5.1. Two or more owners or operators of buildings or land uses requiring
off-street parking facilities may make collective provision for such facilities;
provided that the total of such parking spaces when combined or used
together shall not be less than the sum of the requirements computed
separately.
11.1.5.2. No part of an off-street area required for any building or use shall be
included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another
building or use unless the Administrative Official shall find that the type of use
indicates that the period of usage will not overlap or be concurrent with each
other.
Sec. 11.1.6. EMPLOYEE PARKING.
Where off-street parking facilities are specified on the basis of number of
employees, such parking shall be clearly marked and reserved for use of such
employees. Where a use is required to provide and reserve a certain number of
spaces for employees and the number of employees increase after the building is
occupied, then the amount of off-street parking provided shall be increased in ratio
to the increase in the number of employees. Plans submitted shall make provision
for projected full or peak employment.
LDR 11 - 6
Sec. 11.1.7. NONCONFORMING USES.
Where major repairs, alterations or extensions of use are to be made in a building
occupied by a nonconforming use, no such repairs, alterations or extensions shall
be permitted unless and until the off-street parking requirements for a conforming
use of the type involved in the district in which such use is first permitted are applied
to the existing building or use and full provision for off-street parking facilities is
made.
ARTICLE 2. OFF-STREET LOADING
Sec. 11.2.1. ACCESSIBILITY TO STREET AND INTERIOR OF BUILDING.
Each off-street loading space shall be directly accessible from a street or alley
without crossing or entering any other required off-street loading space. Such
loading space shall be accessible from the interior of the building it serves and shall
be arranged for convenient and safe ingress and egress by straight truck and/or
tractor trailer combination or service vehicle.
Sec. 11.2.2. CHANGE OF USE OR ENLARGEMENT OF STRUCTURE.
When the use of a structure or land or any part thereof is changed to a use requiring
off-street loading facilities, the full amount of off-street loading space required shall
be supplied and maintained. When any structure is enlarged or any use extended
so that the size of the resulting occupancy requires off-street loading space, the full
amount of such space shall be supplied and maintained for the structure or use in its
enlarged or extended size.
Sec. 11.2.3. COMBINED LOADING FACILITIES.
Collective, joint or combined provisions for off-street loading facilities for two or more
buildings or uses may be made; provided, that such off-street loading facilities are
equal in size and capacity to the combined requirements of the several buildings or
uses and are designed, located and arranged to be usable by the uses so involved.
Sec. 11.2.4. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
Off-street loading spaces shall be provided and maintained as follows:
11.2.4.1. Each retail store, storage warehouse, wholesale establishment,

ARTICLE 1. GENERAL.
Sec. 12.1.1. PURPOSE.
Transportation, as used in the context of the Land Development Regulations, refers
to general public safety and convenience criteria for streets; driveway intersections
with streets; visibility at street intersections and driveways with streets; highway
visual design; reservations of right-of-ways and adjacent land uses; sidewalks and
pedestrian access and design and, airways/airport zoning.
ARTICLE 2. STREETS
Sec. 12.2.1. STREETS SERVING COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.
12.2.1.1. Streets serving commercial developments or subdivisions and
accessory parking areas shall be planned to connect with arterial or collector
streets so as not to generate traffic on minor streets nor to provide principal
access through residential developments. The intersections of driveways
from parking areas with arterial or collector streets shall be located so as to
cause the least possible interference with traffic movement on the street, and
shall be located not less than 100 feet from the intersection of an arterial or

structures of a permanent nature shall be located on or within such
easement.
Sec. 13.3.5. BLOCKS.
As used in this Chapter, a block is a group of lots entirely surrounded by streets,
railroad right-of-way, water courses, subdivision boundaries or any combination
thereof.
13.3.5.1. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
13.3.5.1.1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated;

require one or more public crosswalks with a right-of-way not less than 10
feet and to extend entirely across the block and at locations deemed
necessary. Cul-de-sac or "T" block arrangements may be less than 500 feet
in length.
Sec. 13.3.6. LOTS
As used in this Chapter a lot is a portion of a subdivision intended for transfer of
ownership as a unit, or for development as a unit or both, the boundaries of which

have been clearly designated upon the plat. This definition is deemed to be in
furtherance of the lot definition in Chapter 4 of the Land Development Regulations.
13.3.6.1. The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation, and minimum
building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision
and for the type of development and use contemplated.
13.3.6.2. Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the zoning
requirements and:
13.3.6.2.1. Residential lots, where not served by public sewer, shall be of a
size and dimension approved by the Department of Health by in no
case less than as specified in the zoning requirements.
13.3.6.2.2. Depth and width of properties reserved or designated for
commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for
the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use
and development contemplated.
13.3.6.3. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width meeting zoning
requirements to permit minimum building setback from and orientation to
both streets.

to an existing public street. In no case shall a lot be less than 24 feet in width
at the front property line.
13.3.6.5. Double frontage, and reverse frontage lots, shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterial
streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
development orientation. A planting buffer easement of at least 10 feet and
across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the
line of lots abutting such an arterial street or other incompatible use and as
may be required in the zoning regulations.

shall not be located in any retention area. All sites designated in subdivision
plats for public use shall be dedicated in the plat and deeded to the City for
this purpose.
13.3.7.2. In order to provide adequate recreation sites and facilities for the
residents of the City, in accordance with the goals, standards, policies and
plans of the Recreation and Open Space Element, a recreation impact fee
shall be charged for each new dwelling constructed after adoption of this
Chapter. The recreation impact fee shall be established by the City
Commission and collected at the time of building permit application. Such
fees shall be held in escrow and used by the City only for the purpose of
acquiring lands for parks and recreation and improvements thereon. Such
lands and improvements shall be as near as practical to the fee payers,
depending upon needs as established in the Recreation and Open Space
Element.
13.3.7.3. When required by the Comprehensive Plan or deemed essential by
the City Commission, upon consideration of the particular type of
development proposed in the subdivision and especially in large-scale
planned developments, the City Commission may require the dedication or
reservation of such other areas or sites of character, extent, and location
suitable to the needs created by such development for schools, parks, and
other neighborhood purposes. Such sites shall be made available by the
developer to the governmental agency responsible for such facilities for their
acceptance for a period of 2 years.
If the applicable governmental agency fails to purchase or make
arrangements for the acquisition of the site within the 2 year period, the City
Commission shall be required to review the continued need of the reserved
sites and may extend the reservation for another 2 year period. Subsequent
reviews on a 2 year time basis shall be required until a determination is made
by the City Commission that the reserved sites are no longer required or
necessary. If it is determined by the City Commission that the reserved sites
are no longer required or necessary then the developer may replat the
reserved site for uses compatible with the development and in accordance
with the Comprehensive Plan.
13.3.7.4. If a significant surface drainage course or water body is located in an area
being considered for subdividing, the City Commission may require the
dedication of lands or easements along each side of the drainage course or
water body for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, ponding,
improving or protecting the drainage course or water body for drainage,
parkway or recreational purposes.
13.3.7.5. Within the Auburndale Green Swamp Protection Area, all residential
development shall provide a minimum open space set-aside of no less than
LDR13 - 15
30% of total land area. Open space is defined as passive recreation,
agriculture or conservation easement. Retention/Detention areas and golf
courses do not count as open space.
Sec. 13.3.8 Retention/Detention Areas
13.3.8.1. Placement. Retention and/or Detention areas shall be placed on the side
or the rear of lots.

ARTICLE 1 ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Sec. 14.1.1 GENERAL
These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Chapter of the City of
Auburndale Land Development Regulations, hereinafter referred to as this chapter or
these regulations.
14.1.1.1. SCOPE. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development
that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including
but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site
improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration,
remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation
or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from
the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of
manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or
replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of
swimming pools; and any other development.
14.1.1.2 INTENT. The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood
resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to
establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to
flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to:
A. Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public
service during times of flooding;
B. Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to
prevent or minimize future flood damage;
C. Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling
operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;
D. Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and
shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and
beneficial functions of the floodplain;
E. Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood hazard areas;
G. Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood
control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and
H. Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for
community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal
Regulations, Section 59.22.
14.1.1.3. COORDINATION WITH THE FLORIDA BUILDING CODE. This
chapter is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with
the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of
the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code.
LDR 14-3
14.1.1.4. WARNING. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and
the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered
the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will
occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood
hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will
be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base
flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on
Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of
Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise
these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future
use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter, however,
every consideration shall be given for vested, existing, or future use.
14.1.1.5. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City of Auburndale or by any officer or employee thereof
for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Sec. 14.1.2 APPLICABILITY.
14.1.2.1. GENERAL. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement
and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.

apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of Auburndale, as
established in Section 14.1.2.3 of this chapter.
14.1.2.3. BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING FLOOD HAZARD AREAS. The Flood
Insurance Study for Polk County, Florida and Incorporated Areas,
effective September 28, 2012, identified by Flood Insurance Study
Number 12105CV001B, and all subsequent amendments and revisions,
and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all
subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by
reference as a part of this chapter and shall serve as the minimum basis
for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish
flood hazard areas are on file at the Office of Community Development.
14.1.2.3.1. SUBMISSION OF ADDITIONAL DATA TO ESTABLISH
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS. To establish flood hazard areas and
base flood elevations, pursuant to Sec. 14.1.5 of this chapter, the
Floodplain Administrator may require submission of additional
data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida
licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by
the community indicates that ground elevations:
A. Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in
LDR 14-4
areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM,
the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to
the requirements of this chapter and, as applicable, the
requirements of the Florida Building Code.
B. Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area
shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the
applicant obtains a Letter of Map Change that removes the area
from the special flood hazard area.
14.1.2.4. OTHER LAWS. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to
nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law.
14.1.2.5. ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. This chapter
supersedes any chapter in effect for management of development in
flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any
existing chapters including but not limited to land development
regulations, zoning chapters, storm water management regulations, or
the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this chapter
and any other chapter, the more restrictive shall govern. This chapter
shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land
that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this chapter.
14.1.2.6.INTERPRETATION. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
A. Considered as minimum requirements;
B. Shall be considered in light of the governing body; and
C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.

cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or
topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this
chapter or the required elevation standards.
B. Determination by the Board of Adjustment that:
1. Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that
render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the
requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship;
2. The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances;
and
3. The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief;
C. Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the
variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the
Clerk of the Court in such a manner that it appears in the
chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and
D. If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the
lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of
a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record
of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the
applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between
the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the
lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for
$100 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction
below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and
property.

CHAPTER 15. SPECIAL OVERLAY DISTRICTS
ARTICLE 1. GENERAL
Sec. 15.1.1. Purpose.
An Overlay District is a zoning tool that provides specific design standards for development in a
designated area. An overlay district is used to either protect the pre-existing character of an area or to
create a character that would not otherwise be possible through the enforcement of the existing
development standards of the current base zoning district. Overlay districts exist as an additional layer
of regulation atop of an underlying base zoning district, providing development standards that are
typically above and beyond those established in the underlying base zoning district. The boundaries of
an overlay district may or may not coincide with the boundaries of an underlying base zoning district
and in some cases may cover more than one underlying base zoning district.
Sec. 15.1.2. Relationship to Underlying Base Zoning District Provisions.
Regulations applicable to the underlying zone remain in full force and effect except where superseded
herein. Where there is a provision not expressed in the underlying zone, or where a provision herein is
in conflict with the underlying zone, the provision of the overlay district shall supersede and regulate the
development. Where a regulation is more restrictive in other Articles of this Code, the more restrictive
regulation shall apply. Nothing within Chapter 15, Special Overlay Districts, shall be interpreted or
construed as limiting the applicability of the provisions of Chapter 6, Special Provisions, PUDS, Clusters.
Sec. 15.1.3. Relationship to Green Swamp Area of Critical State Concern Provisions.
All density and intensity regulations specific to areas located within the Green Swamp Area of Critical
State Concern supersede any such regulations in this section. All enhanced design standards provided in
the Overlay sections apply to areas within the Green Swamp Area of Critical State Concern as these
design standards include enhanced landscaping and low impact design.

along the top of a building or a wall plane, the uppermost projecting section of an entablature.
Cross-Access Easement: Connections provided for both motor vehicles and pedestrians, which provide
interconnected access between abutting lots to destinations such as businesses, eateries, offices, open
spaces, trail systems, bus stops, entertainment venues, and other uses.
Façade (building façade): Any side of a building facing a public right-of-way or pedestrian-oriented
space and finished accordingly.
Façade Articulation: Physical changes in the depth of the surface of a building, demonstrated through,
but not limited to, the application of recessed entranceways, attached columns, recessed or projected
windows bays, and other forms of architectural expression.

Florida-Friendly Landscape: A landscaping method which conserves water, protects the environment, is
adaptable to local conditions and is drought tolerant. The principles of Florida-friendly design include
planning and design, appropriate choice of plants, soil analysis, efficient irrigation, practical use of turf,
appropriate use of mulches, and proper maintenance.
Form (Building Form): The shape and mass of a building. Building shapes can emphasize certain
directional characteristics either horizontal, vertical, or square/box.
Furnishing Zone: An area between the curb of a street and the base of building which provides a
functional space and in some cases a safety barrier for pedestrians through the use of street trees,
decorative bollards, pedestrian lighting, benches, trash cans, and other street furnishings.
Kickplate: A decorative panel or skirting along the base of a building, used to create a visual separation
between a building and a pedestrian walkway. Kickplates should be constructed of durable materials to
withstand the vigors of pedestrian activity.
Low Impact Development (LID): Design techniques used to maintain or replicate pre-development

Sec. 15.3.4.5.5. Design Standards for Affixed Signs.
A. Affixed signs for buildings with a single business or occupant.
1. Size Permitted: One (1) square foot for each linear foot of the building width that
faces the street frontage, provided that the total signage area shall not exceed
two hundred (200) square feet, including buildings on corner lots. (For example,
if the width of the building facing the front of the lot is fifty (50) feet wide, the
maximum total signage area is fifty (50) square feet. If the building is on a corner
lot, then the widths of the building facing multiple street frontages can be added
together to determine the total signage area but in no case shall the total
building signage exceed two hundred (200) square feet, nor shall any individual
sign exceed the square footage corresponding to the linear width of the building
side on which that sign is posted.)
2. Number of Building Signs Permitted: Not more than two (2) building signs shall be
allowed on any building.
B. Affixed signs for buildings with multiple businesses or occupants.
1. Size Permitted: One (1) square foot for each linear foot of the unit(s) occupied by one
(1) business or occupant, provided that the total signage area shall not exceed two
hundred (200) square feet for any one (1) business. If the business or occupant is
on the comer then the widths of the business or occupant facing multiple street
frontages can be added together to determine the total signage area but in no
case shall the total business or occupant signage exceed two hundred (200)
square feet, nor shall any individual sign exceed the square footage corresponding
to the linear width of the building side on which that sign is posted. (For example, if
the width of a unit or several units, occupied by one (1) business is sixty-five (65) feet,
then one (1) sign, a maximum of sixty-five (65) square feet of signage area is
permitted.)
2. Required Spacing between Signs on Buildings with Multiple Occupants: Building signs
for different occupants shall be separated by a minimum distance of thirty-six (36)
inches.
Sec. 15.3.4.5.6. Design Standards for Projecting Signs.

shall have no more than two sides.
B. One (1) projecting sign may be permitted per principal ground-floor business.
C. Projecting signs shall not exceed eight (8) square feet in sign area if mounted at a height of
fifteen (15) feet or lower as measured from the finished sidewalk to the bottom of the sign.
24
D. Projecting signs shall not exceed twenty-five (25) square feet in sign area if mounted higher
than fifteen (15) feet as measured from the finished sidewalk to the bottom of the sign.
E. Projecting signs shall be located within five feet (5) (horizontally) of the principal business
entrance. In no case, however, shall a projecting sign be mounted within ten (10) feet of any
other projecting sign.
F. Projecting signs may project no more than forty-two (42) inches from the building wall.
G. Projecting signs shall maintain a seven (7) foot clearance, between the bottom of the sign
and the finished surface of all public and private pedestrian pathways.

Sec. 15.3.4.5.11. Directional Signs.
Directional signs are permitted in accordance with the requirements for directional signage in
Article 7 of this Code.
Sec. 15.3.4.5.12. Signage Lighting and Landscaping Requirements.
A. Sign Illumination. If exterior signs are lit they shall be lit by external light sources only. Lights
shall be installed, mounted, shielded and pointed toward the sign face so that spill-over,
glare, and light trespass on adjacent rights-of-way, properties, or skyward are completely
avoided.
B. Wall-mounted signs shall be lit with indirect light sources which light the subject sign while
at the same time emphasizing the continuity of the building surface. With indirect lighting,
signage becomes an integral part of the building façade.
28
C. Lighting used to illuminate ground-mounted or monument signs may utilize groundmounted
up-lighting in accordance with the sign illumination standards established in
subsection A. above.
D. Internal illumination may be acceptable when only the letters themselves  not the
background of a sign  are illuminated.
E. The average illumination on the surface of a sign shall not exceed 3.0 footcandles.
F. Sign Landscaping. All monument signs shall include a minimum thirty-six inch (36) wide
landscape strip surrounding the base of the monument sign. The landscape strip shall be

development within the JPA Overlay District requiring site plan approval. The signage plan may
be submitted as part of the site development plan or as a separate plan. The signage plan shall,
at a minimum, provide the following:
A. Representation of how the signage will be consistent with the identity of the JPA Overlay
District.
B. Representation of how the signage detailing, materials, coloring and lettering will be
consistent with the design and character of the principal structure for which the sign will
represent.
C. Exhibits that display the size, type and materials proposed, including but not limited to,
building address identification, any required landscaping and method of illumination.
Sec. 15.3.4.6. Landscaping.
Landscaping requirements for all development shall respect the landscaping standards of Chapter 10
of this Code, except as expressly supplemented or modified under the regulations established for
the JPA Overlay District.
A. Landscape buffers are not required between uses within activity centers, except where a nonresidential
use directly abuts a residential use.
B. Where landscape buffers are required and references to the types of buffers required are
specified (i.e., Type-C), see the general landscape buffering standards provided in Sec.
15.3.4.6.1.
29
Sec. 15.3.4.6.1. General Landscape Buffering Standards.
A buffer yard is an area containing plant material, fences, walls and/or berms which provide a
visual screen and physical separation between incompatible land uses. Buffer yards are intended
as landscaped open space therefore, they shall be free of pavement and permanent structures
other than fences, walls, berms, pedestrian paths, stormwater management and retention
facilities, and signs.
Figure 15.3-10 illustrates the planting requirements for buffer yards within the JPA Overlay
District. Each buffer yard type provides the number and type of plantings required per each 100
linear feet, or fraction thereof, excluding any driveway access. The plant material does not need
to be equally spaced and may be placed in any configuration, or grouped to best display the
plant material within the required buffer yard area. When natural plant material is present, it
may be counted towards the total buffer yard requirement for trees and shrubs provided the
existing material is generally consistent with the intent of this Article.

maintained or where LID engineered systems or approved Florida Friendly landscaping
practices are implemented.
2. Landscaped areas requiring the installation of an irrigation system shall be consistent
with the needs of the plants contained therein and water conservation efficient.
3. An irrigation system shall be designed to provide full coverage of all landscape areas
without over spraying onto impervious surfaces including pavement, vehicular or
pedestrian areas and/or adjacent properties.
4. The irrigation system shall be operational prior to the issuance of any Certificate of
Occupancy/Completion for the property.
C. Maintenance. All Landscape areas, including landscaping used for screening purposes shall
be maintained and kept in good, living condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly
appearance and shall be kept free from weeds, refuse and debris, following issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.
Sec. 15.3.4.7. Fences and Walls.
Fences and walls serve multiple purposes. They can be used to identify and demarcate property
boundaries, serve as screening devices, and/or provide privacy and security. In keeping with the
style and character of the JPA Overlay District, all fences and walls shall meet the following
standards. Figure 15.3-11 provides several examples of permitted and prohibited fencing and wall
types.
A. Walls and fences shall be limited to concrete, masonry, brick, stone and ornamental iron. The
use of chain link, PVC, barbed and razor wire fencing is strictly prohibited, except as provided in
as provided in subsections B. below.
32
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the use of security fencing may be used at sites,
such as electrical substations and communications facilities, and government facilities where
such fencing is required by federal, state or local law, or other sections of this Code. Further,
temporary security fencing may be utilized for construction sites while a permit for the work is
active for the construction site. All temporary fences shall be removed prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy.
C. All walls and fences shall have a decorative or ornamental finish on both sides. These may
include, but are not limited to, finished stucco, brick and stone treatments (real or simulated)
and paint applications.
D. Decorative columns shall be provided at systematic intervals, not to exceed a separation
distance of more than twenty feet (20) on center for all fencing and walls abutting a public
right-of-way or having a public visual presence, in order to break up monotonous wall planes
and create visual interest.
E. No wall or fence shall cause the collection or ponding of stormwater. Weep holes of sufficient
size and design shall be installed where the foregoing condition would occur.
F. Walls and fences shall not encroach upon any utility or right-of-way easements.

Sec. 15.3.4.8.1. Building and Landscape Lighting Standards.
Lighting of buildings and landscape features shall be provided as follows:
A. Accent lighting may be used to highlight significant architectural or landscape features.
Washing a building in light should be avoided. All fixtures shall be carefully aimed to direct
light only where needed. Lighting of signs affixed to building shall be coordinated with the
standards provided in Sec. 15.3.4.5.12.
B. The maximum illumination on any vertical wall surface or angular roof surface, including the
area within and around windows and doors, shall not exceed 2.5 footcandles. Light levels
shall be limited to 0.1 footcandles at the roofline and exterior corners, so as to prevent light
trespass and sky glow.
C. Lighting should be mounted to shine downward, rather than up onto buildings. Where
fixtures are used to up-light trees and landscaping features, they should be fully shielded.
Sec. 15.3.4.9. Building Ornamentation.
The intent of adding building ornamentation is to provide additional visual appeal and to maintain
and enhance the attractiveness of both buildings and streetscapes within the JPA Overlay District.
For developments applying building ornamentations, the following standards shall apply.

37
Sec. 15.3.4.9.3. Other Ornamentation Features.
Towers and other vertical features, ornamental details and sculpted artwork may be integrated
into the design of a building(s). Any logos or lettering incorporated into such design features
shall be considered as signage and will be required to be calculated as part of the total signage
area.
Sec. 15.3.4.10. Streetside Principles.
This section provides guidance for the design of a thoroughfare's streetside and the specific
elements that comprise the streetside environment. It addresses how the design of the streetside
varies with changes in context.
Sec. 15.3.4.10.1. Streetside Zone Descriptions.
This section describes the design of sidewalks and the buffers between sidewalks, moving
traffic, parking and/or other travel-way elements. The streetside consists of four distinct
functional zones as listed below. Figure 15.3-16 provides an illustration of these zones.
 Edge zone. The area between the face of curb and the furnishing zone that provides the
minimum necessary separation between objects and activities in the streetside and the
adjacent vehicle thoroughfare.
 Furnishings zone. The area of the streetside that provides a buffer between pedestrians and
vehicles, which contains landscaping, public street furniture, transit stops, public signage,
utilities and so forth.
 Throughway zone. The walking zone that must remain clear, both horizontally and vertically,
for the movement of pedestrians.
 Frontage zone. The distance between the throughway and the building front or private
property line that is used to buffer pedestrians from window shoppers, appurtenances and
doorways. It contains private street furniture, private signage, merchandise displays and so
forth and can also be used for street cafes.
38
Figure 15.3-16.
Streetside Zones
Sec. 15.3.4.10.2. Streetside Uses and Activities.
The basic functions of the streetside in any context are the accommodation of pedestrians,
access to adjoining buildings and properties and the provision of clear throughway zones and
space for utilities and other streetside appurtenances. In the built environment, these basic
functions are shared with the activities generated by the adjacent land use and general civic
functions, which can include:
 Aesthetics (i.e., street trees and public art);
 Sidewalk cafes, plazas and seating areas;
 Transit amenities (such as benches, shelters, trash receptacles and waiting areas);
 Merchandise display; and
 Occasional public activities (i.e., curbside farmers' markets).
Streetside functions vary by context zone and predominant ground floor land use. The width of
certain elements of the streetside (i.e., the furnishings zone functioning as a traffic buffer) will
vary by thoroughfare type depending on the existence or lack of on-street parking and the
speed and volume of vehicular traffic on the thoroughfare.
39
Sec. 15.3.4.10.3. General Streetside Facility Principles.
The streetside, including the sidewalk, provides for the mobility of people and is an important
social space where people interact, walk, wait for transit, window shop and access adjoining
uses. The streetside must be wide enough to accommodate movement as well as the important
social functions related to the land uses located along the thoroughfare. The width and function
of the streetside influence safety and help achieve accessibility. The optimal streetside width
varies with the expected streetside activities, character of adjacent land uses and the speed and
volume of vehicular traffic in the thoroughfare.
The following principles shall be considered when determining the design of streetside facilities:
A. Facilities shall be placed in locations where their use will produce and encourage pedestrian
activity or where an activity focus is desired. Public open spaces and features such as art
should be located in highly visible areas, including the center islands of low-speed
roundabouts (ensuring sight triangles are maintained and placement does not constitute a
streetside hazards).
B. The streetside should have well-defined zones so that the pedestrian throughway is clearly
demarcated.
C. The style, design and materials used in developing a streetside facility shall reflect the style
of the land use, the overall development, while keeping in character of the overall JPA
Overlay District. This will maximize the facility's contribution to creating a strong sense of
community identity.
D. Coordinate design elements (street furniture, light fixtures and poles, tree grates and so
forth) to fit into the theme or unified style of the development scheme.
E. Facilities approaching street corners shall be designed in a manner that maintains clear sight
triangles.
F. Consider vehicle overhangs and door swings of parked vehicles.
G. Facilities should never obstruct the clear pedestrian throughway, curb ramps, or any
accessible element(s) of the streetside.
H. Consider the placement of vertical elements (i.e., awning, signage) so adequate lateral
clearance is available and does not encroach on clear maneuverability of pedestrians within
the throughway zone.
I. Care should be given where driveways cross pedestrian throughways. Driveway crossings
shall maintain the elevation of the sidewalk. The use of special materials, colors, textures
and markings alerting motorists that they are traversing a pedestrian zone is highly
encouraged. Figure 15.3-17 provides examples of preferred design methods for accessible
driveway crossings.
40
J. Utilities should not interfere with pedestrian circulation or block entrances to buildings or
curb cuts or interfere with sight distance triangles. Designers should coordinate with utility
providers regarding the location of utility elements such as poles, cabinets, vaults, grates
and manholes.
K. Space requirements for, and access to, transit facilities (such as bus shelters) should be
included in the design of the streetside but must be outside of the clear pedestrian travel
way.
L. Sidewalks shall provide convenient connections between building entries, adjacent
pedestrian pathways and transit facilities.
Figure 15.3-17.
Preferred Accessible Driveway Crossings
Sec. 15.3.4.10.4. Edge Zone Principles and Considerations.
The edge zone, sometimes referred to as the "curb zone," is the interface between the traveled
way and the furnishing zone and provides an operational offset to the adjacent vehicle
thoroughfare on one side and the furnishings zone or pedestrian throughway zone on the other.
In addition to acting as the primary buffer from the vehicle throughway, the edge zone is
typically where underground utilities and vaults are located.
Sec. 15.3.4.10.5. Furnishing Zone Principles and Considerations.
The furnishings zone is the key buffer component between the active pedestrian walking area
(throughway zone) and the vehicular thoroughfare. Principles and considerations concerning
furnishings zones include the following:
A. Street trees, planting strips, street furniture, utility poles, signal poles, signal and electrical
cabinets, telephones, traffic signal cabinets, signs, fire hydrants, bicycle racks and the like
should be consolidated in this zone to keep them from becoming obstacles in the
throughway zone.
B. The furnishings zone accommodates curbside transit stops, including boarding areas,
shelters and passenger queuing areas.
41
C. When signal control cabinets, signal poles and other traffic equipment are installed, they
must leave pedestrians in clear sight of, and in alignment with, motorist's views at all times.
This might require special setbacks for oversized equipment.
D. Retail kiosks, stands, sidewalk café furniture and other business activities are permitted in
the furnishings zone if the furnishings zone is sufficiently wide to maintain a 1.5-foot
minimum lateral clearance from the curb and any potential conflicts with parked vehicles
(i.e., door swings).
E. Where no furnishings zone exists, elements that would normally be placed there, such as
benches, light poles, signals and trash receptacles, may occupy the frontage zone to keep
the clear pedestrian travel way unobstructed.
Sec. 15.3.4.10.6. Throughway Zone Principles and Considerations.
Principles and considerations concerning throughway zones include the following:
A. Clear pedestrian throughway zones are intended for pedestrian travel only and should be
entirely clear of obstacles and provide a smooth walking surface.
B. Width of the throughway zone should vary by context and the activity of the adjacent land
use, in no case shall a throughway zone be less than five feet (5) in width.
C. For very high pedestrian volume areas, such transit transfer points and assembly entrances
and exits, additional width and special design attention, particularly at crossings, should be
provided.
Sec. 15.3.4.10.7. Frontage Zone Principles and Considerations.
The frontage zone is the area adjacent to the throughway zone that may be defined by a
building façade, landscaping, fence, or screened parking area. Principles and considerations
concerning frontage zones include the following:
A. The width of the frontage zone may vary to accommodate a variety of activities associated
with adjacent uses, such as outdoor seating or merchant displays. A minimum of eighteen
inches (18) shall be established adjacent to the throughway zone. Ground-surface materials
differing in color and texture, coordinated with the look and character of the building, are
highly encouraged to help differentiate general public and public/private spaces, while
providing a visual aesthetic.
B. Sidewalk cafés and other business activities shall be conducted within the frontage zone
and, in some instances, depending on the conditions of the adjacent vehicle thoroughfare,
may be conducted within the furnishings zone. Private furnishings permitted, may include
seating and tables, private signage and merchandise displays.
C. Overhanging elements such as awnings, canopies and signage may also occupy this zone and
in some instances may extend over the clear pedestrian throughway. See standards for
42
building ornamentation and signage requirements within the JPA Overlay district for
additional guidance on required clearances.
D. Where the streetside passes a parking area, a buffer, such as a hedge or a low wall, shall be

Sec. 15.3.4.14. Low Impact Development.
Sec. 15.3.4.14.1. General.
All development within the JPA Overlay District is encouraged to incorporate Low Impact
Development (LID) practices into design proposals. These practices help to provide mutual
economic, environmental, stormwater management and aesthetic benefits. Implementation of
LID practices can help to increase the developable area of a site by decreasing the size of
traditional stormwater retention and detention areas. Examples of LID strategies include, but
are not limited to the following.
 Permeable pavement: a hard, yet penetrable surface which reduces surface water run-off by
allowing water to move thru the pavement surface and directly into the ground below.
 Vegetated swales and landscape islands: An alternative to traditional curb and gutter
systems, where surface water run-off is purposely directed to landscaped infiltration
points/areas along streets and within parking areas.
47
 Green/Eco-roof systems: These systems can significantly reduce the rate and quantity of
stormwater run-off from a roof and provide buildings with thermal insulation and enhanced
aesthetics.
 Bio-retention basins and Rain gardens: Small vegetative depressions in the landscape which
collect and filter stormwater directly into the ground.
 Stormwater reuse: Engineered surface ponds and other catchment devices which store
rainfall for future irrigation and potable water purposes. Small scale systems can include
cisterns and rain barrels.
Sec. 15.3.4.14.2. LID Standards in Practice.
A. Eligibility. Credits and incentives for implementing LID standards may be approved as set
forth in this section, subject to the following, which must be included by an applicant as part
of the development plan:
1. During the site plan and/or preliminary plat process the applicant must demonstrate
that use of LID techniques proposed in the development plan addresses at least 50
percent of the site's post-development impervious area, calculated by a state licensed
professional engineer based upon professionally acceptable methodology.
2. All LID techniques must include provisions for maintenance and enforcement to ensure
that the original design remains intact and continues to provide the benefits originally
designed.
3. Credits and incentives will be reviewed and may be approved, approved with conditions
based on site conditions and proposed LID techniques, or denied by the Administrative
Official, or his or her designee in accordance with the requirements of this section, and
subsections B. and C. below.
B. Acceptable LID techniques to receive eligible incentive credits. The following are determined
to be acceptable LID techniques for which credit may be awarded:
1. Shallow retention areas. This category includes bio-retention areas, inverted landscape
areas and planted retention areas, if these areas are less than two feet in depth and
integrated within the landscaped area of a site.
2. Pervious pavement. Pervious pavement techniques utilize a variety of materials and
construction designs that allow movement of stormwater flow through sustainable
material that contain pores and separation joints with eventual seepage into a base
material. Types of pervious pavement include, but are not limited to, porous asphalt and
concrete, plastic or concrete grid systems with gravel-filled voids, grass pavers/turf
blocks and granitic gravel. Soft gravel, asphalt millings, mulch, crushed limerick or
equivalent are not considered pervious pavement.
48
3. Green roofs. A green roof is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered
with non-invasive vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing
membrane. The purpose of a green roof is to absorb and treat rainwater, provide
insulation, create habitat for wildlife and mitigate the heat island effect.
4. Resource efficient landscapes. Resource efficient landscapes are Florida-friendly
landscapes as defined by F.S. § 373.185. Resource efficient landscapes must use in-situ
(on site) native soils, avoid soil compaction, provide wildlife habitat, reduce cover of turf
grass species, use native plant species best adapted to the conditions present before
planting and will not need supplemental water, fertilizer and pesticides once
established.
C. Incentives for use of LID techniques. The following incentives for implementing LID
techniques may be approved during the site plan and/or preliminary plat process, where the
requirements of this section are met:
1. Credit for shallow retention areas shall count toward the landscape requirements of
Chapter 10, Sec. 10.6.1.3. at a ratio of one square foot of site landscape area for every
one square foot of shallow retention area provided.
2. Credit for use of pervious pavement techniques shall count toward the requirements of
development sites requiring open space (i.e., big box retail development) at a ratio of
one-half square foot of open space area for every one square foot of pervious pavement
provided.
3. Credit for green roof area shall count toward the requirements of development sites
requiring open space (i.e., big box retail development) at a ratio of two square feet of
open space area for every one square foot of green roof provided.
4. Credit for use of resource efficient landscapes shall count toward the requirements of
Chapter 10, Sec. 10.6.1.3. at a ratio of one and one-half square foot of landscape area
for every one square foot of resource efficient landscape provided.
5. Special consideration for exceptions to the irrigation requirements, pursuant to Sec.
15.3.4.6.2. may be given, based on alternative watering plans following best
management practices in the State of Florida as determined by a landscaping
professional and approved by the Administrative Official, or his or her designee.
6. The following may be granted where the minimum 50 percent capture rate of postdevelopment
impervious area, calculated by a state licensed professional engineer
based upon professionally acceptable methodology, can be justified
a. The number of vehicular parking spaces may be reduced by 25 percent below the
standard parking requirement for the underlying zoning district.
b. An increase in FAR may be granted up to the maximum bonus allotment as specified
within individual specific activity centers.
49
D. Application: Developments wishing to incorporate LID practices into a site design shall be
required to coordinate with the Administrative Official, or his or her designee. Additional
coordination may be required with the State of Florida and the Southwest Florida Water
Management District to meet engineering and permitting requirements.
E. Maintenance: Maintenance shall be the responsibility of the facility owner unless any
maintenance and easement agreements are executed.

ARTICLE 2. FUTURE LAND USE MAP AMENDMENTS.
Sec. 21.2.1. GENERAL.
LDR 21 - 5
The adoption of the Comprehensive Plan by the City Commission included the adoption of
a Future Land Use Map, which is a component of the Future Land Use Element. This
Element is one of the eight Plan Elements adopted by the City. The Future Land Use Map
is the instrument used to graphically designate all lands within the corporate limits with
future land use classifications. The future land use classifications determine and dictate the
type of zoning district to be applied to each parcel of land within the City. The individual
zoning district applied to a parcel of land determines the actual uses permitted.
Due to unforeseen changing conditions and circumstances in and around the City, driven in
part by market conditions and migration of people to the State and beyond local control,
request will be submitted for amendments to the Future Land Use Map. Generally these
requests will be for change of the adopted land use classification on a parcel of land to a
greater density or more intense land use classification.
Petitions for such amendments will require review by City Staff to determine, if granted, the
internal consistency with all of the other Plan Elements, what impacts such change would
have on public facilities, the compatibility with adjoining land uses, existing and projected,
and if the Concurrency Management System conditions and level of service standards can
be met.
A Future Land Use Map amendment is required to be submitted to the State Land
Planning Agency for either a 30 or 60 day review process. The purpose of this review is
to determine if the proposed Map amendment is in compliance with the applicable
provisions of Chapter 163, F.S. Amendments to the Plan, including Future Land Use
Map amendments, may be made not more than four times during any calendar year,
except in the case of an emergency and except as provided for in Sec. 21.2.7. herein.
Sec. 21.2.2. MAP AMENDMENT FREQUENCY.
21.2.2.1. The Comprehensive Plan can be amended no more than four times
per calendar year for land use amendments, except as provided for in Sec.
21.2.7. herein. In order to comply with State law and to minimize the
administration process for amendments, the City has established the four
transmittal public hearing dates as follows. These dates are intended to be
used as guidelines and may be adjusted by the Administrative Official, as
appropriate.
21.2.2.1.1. The City Commission meeting immediately following the
January Planning Commission meeting;
21.2.2.1.2. The City Commission meeting immediately following the April
Planning Commission meeting;
21.2.2.1.3. The City Commission meeting immediately following the July

CHAPTER 23. CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE
The Concurrency Management System shall measure the impact of any proposed
development or expansion to an existing development for which a development
order is required, upon the established level of service for a roadway, sanitary
sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water and parks/recreation public facility or
service. The most current available information and data regarding the above public
facilities shall be utilized for concurrency evaluations. No final development order
shall be approved unless adequate public facilities and services are available as
determined by the Concurrency Management System and the Comprehensive Plan.
ARTICLE 2. REQUIREMENTS.
Sec. 23.2.1. LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS.
23.2.1.1. For the purpose of the issuance of development orders and permits,
the City must adopt level of service standards for public facilities and services
located within the area for which the City has authority to issue development
orders and permits. For the purposes of concurrency, public facilities and
services include the following for which level of service standards must be
adopted under Chapter 9J-5, F.A.C.:
23.2.1.1.1. Roads, Rule 9J-5.007(3)(c)1.
23.2.1.1.2. Sanitary sewer, Rule 9J-5.011(2)(c)2.a.
23.2.1.1.3. Solid waste, Rule 9J-5.011(2)(c)2.b.

plan which demonstrates that the City can achieve and maintain the adopted
level of service standards.
LDR 23 - 4
23.2.1.3. In analyzing and establishing its level of service standards for roads,
the City must to the maximum extent feasible as determined by the City,
adopt level of service standards for state roads that are compatible with the
level of service standards established by the Florida Department of
Transportation for such roads.
Sec. 23.2.2. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CONCURRENCY.
A concurrency management system must be developed and adopted to ensure that
public facilities and services needed to support development are available
concurrent with the impacts of such developments.
23.2.2.1. For potable water, sewer, solid waste, and drainage, at a minimum,
provisions in a comprehensive plan that ensure that the following standards
will be met will satisfy the concurrency requirement:
23.2.2.1.1. The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a
development permit is issued; or
23.2.2.1.2. A development permit is issued subject to the condition that the
necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of
the development occur; or
23.2.2.1.3. The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a
permit is issued; or
23.2.2.1.4. The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an
enforceable development agreement that includes the provisions of
Rules 9J-5.005(2)(a)1.-3. of this Chapter. An enforceable
development agreements may include, but is not limited to,
development agreements pursuant to Section 163.3220, F.S., or an
agreement of development order issued pursuant to Chapter 380, F.S.
The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and
services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur.
23.2.2.2. For parks and recreation, the City may satisfy the concurrency
requirement by complying with the standards in Rules 9J-5.0055(2)(a)1.-4. of
this Chapter or by including in the comprehensive plan provisions that ensure
that the following standards will be met:
23.2.2.2.1. At the time the development permit is issued, the necessary
facilities and services are the subject of the binding executed contract
which provides for the commencement of the actual construction of
the required facilities or the provision of services within one year of the
issuance of the development permit; or
LDR 23 - 5
23.2.2.2.2. The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an
enforceable development agreement which requires the
commencement of the actual construction of the facilities or the
provision of services within one year of the issuance of the applicable
development permit. An enforceable development agreement may
include, but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to
Section 163.3220, F.S., or an agreement or development order issued
pursuant to Chapter 380, F.S.

demonstrate that the actual construction of the road facilities and the
provision of services are scheduled to commence in or before the third
year of the five-year schedule of capital improvements.
23.2.2.3.6. A provision that a plan amendment would be required to
eliminate, defer or delay construction of any road facility of service
which is needed to maintain the adopted level of service standard and
which is listed in the five-year schedule of improvements.
23.2.2.3.7. A requirement the City must adopt development regulations
which, in conjunction with the capital improvements element, ensure
that development orders and permits are issued in a manner that will
assure that the necessary public facilities and services will be
available to accommodate the impact of that development.
23.2.2.3.8. A provision that a monitoring system shall be adopted which
enables the City to determine whether it is adhering to the adopted
level of service standards and its schedule of capital improvements
and that the City has a demonstrated capability of monitoring the
availability of public facilities and services.
23.2.2.3.9. A clear designation within the adopted comprehensive plan of
those area within which facilities and services will be provided by the
City with public funds in accordance with the five-year capital
improvement schedule.
23.2.2.4. In determining the availability of services or facilities, a developer may
propose and the City may approve developments in stages or phases so that
facilities and services needed for each phase will be available in accordance
with the standards required by Rules 9J-5.0055(2)(a), (2)(b) and (2)(c) of this
Chapter.
23.2.2.5. For the requirements of Rules 9J-5.0055(2)(a), (2)(b) and (2)(c) of this
Chapter, the City must develop guidelines for interpreting and applying level
of service standards to applications for development orders and permits and
determining when the test for concurrency must be met. The latest point in
the application process for the determination of concurrency is prior to the
approval of an application for a development order or permit which contains a
specific plan for development, including the densities and intensities of
development.

Sec. 23.9.1. CITY RESOURCES.
All departments and agencies that provide and maintain public facilities or services
in the City shall be requested by the Administrative Official (or designee) to provide
data and information that will be necessary to make concurrency determinations.
Primary service providers are considered departments within the City that have a
direct responsibility for maintaining a public facility or provide a public service.
These departments will provide specific information on existing usage, system
capacity, generation factors, and the status of planned facility expansions. The data
and information provided by these departments will be the basis for determining how
much capacity is available for new development while maintaining the adopted level
of service standards. Primary service providers are:

The City shall maintain written or computerized records of all public facility and
service capacities or volumes which are committed for developments as a result of
development orders issued by the City. This process will require coordination
between the service providers and the Administrative Official in order to establish
and maintain an accurate accounting system that systematically tracts development
approvals. At a minimum, the monitoring process must ensure that each service
provider accounts for the impact and demand generated by all development orders
issued by the City.
Accountability shall be established by reserving capacity from the total available
capacity for all approved development orders. Once capacity is reserved for a
specific development, it cannot be allocated to another development. Capacity
reservations shall be renewed no later than June 30 on a yearly basis in order for
facility improvements or services to be entered into or accounted for in the annual
budgetary process. Upon the expiration of a development order with concurrency
standing which is not constructed or deemed by the City to having been abandoned
by an applicant, the capacity allocated to that proposed development shall be
deleted. Deleted capacity shall then be available for use, reservation, or allocation
to other proposed developments on a first come, first serve basis. A priority "waiting
list" shall be established for the purpose of allocating deleted capacity. Reserved
capacity may be transferable from one property owner to another, buy not from one
lot or parcel of land to another. When determining how much capacity is available
for new proposed developments, the City shall take into account all capacity that is
reserved for approved development orders.
Development orders that remain valid through March 1, 1991 (as determined by the
City) shall remain exempt from meeting concurrency requirements, but the
development impacts will be added cumulatively to existing capacities and volumes
for each affected public facility or service in order to establish total committed and
available capacity. Development orders issued by governmental jurisdictions
outside the City shall also be accounted for if the development order is issued within
the service area of a City service provider.
Sec. 23.9.3. ANNUAL SYSTEM ADJUSTMENT.
LDR 23 - 17
LDR 23 - 18
At a minimum, the database component shall be updated as a part of the City's
annual schedule of capital improvements update. Necessary adjustments include:
updating information generated by service providers; making changes (deletions or
reservations) to available facility capacities; adding or deleting capital projects; using
new or enhanced revenue sources; moving projects ahead of schedule; and
delaying projects due to revenue shortfalls. The Administrative Official must ensure
that all relevant information is updated on a regular basis by conducting a monthly
inventory of development orders issued by the City and requiring primary service
providers to maintain current records.
ARTICLE 10. ADMINISTRATION.
Sec. 23.10.1. ADMINISTRATION.
Once a specific development application is accepted as complete, information on:
(a) type of development proposed, (b) number of new or additional dwelling units or
non-residential units, (c) densities or intensities of uses, (d) types of uses or units
and (e) specific boundaries of the proposed development must be documented and
verified. This information shall be collected from the original development
application submitted by the applicant. The Administrative Official will then calculate
the projected public facility and service demands of the proposed development and
identify the public facilities and/or services that will be affected.
If the demands generated by the proposed development, when deducted from the
available capacity, fall below the minimum established level of service standard
thresholds, the proposal will be found in compliance and capacity will be reserved
for needed facilities or services. If a proposed development causes established
thresholds to exceed the adopted LOS standards, the Administrative Official shall
prepare an impact statement and forward copies to all affected primary service
providers. Primary service providers will review impact statements and determine
how much capacity will be available to service the proposed development.
Sec. 23.10.2. CITY STAFF REVIEW MEETINGS.
Each service provider that received an impact statement shall determine if and when
adequate public facilities and/or services will be available to serve the proposed
development and present written findings during City Staff Review Meetings. If a
service provider determines that adequate public facilities and/or services exist to
serve the proposed development, the Administrative Official shall render a finding of
concurrence and capacity will be reserved for that particular facility and/or service
for the proposed development. If a service provider determines that public facilities
and/or services will not be available as a result of lowering the level of service
LDR 23 - 19
standards below thresholds, the Administrative Official shall render a finding of
nonconcurrency.
Within 15 days of the City Staff meeting and receipt of service provider reports, the
Administrative Official shall review the reports and application to determine whether
the application complies with the provisions of this Chapter. If the application
complies with the provisions of this Chapter, the Administrative Official shall issue a
Certificate of Concurrency and capacity shall be reserved. The Certificate of
Concurrency shall specify the public facilities which are to be constructed, timing of
construction and responsibility for construction. The reservation shall be valid for a
period of one year after issuance of a development order. An applicant may renew
the reservation on an annual basis, with the renewal period to be no later than June
30 of each year. All capacity reservations granted between January and June of
each year shall not be required to renew the reservation until the following June.
In case of a finding of noncurrency the applicant shall be so notified, and then may
pursue the mitigation process.
Sec. 23.10.3. MITIGATION.
If levels of service standards fall below thresholds due to the demands generated by
the proposed development, the applicant will be provided the following mitigation
options:
23.10.3.1. Phasing the development in accordance with planned facility
improvements,
23.10.3.2. Scaling bach or reducing the development size in accordance with
available public facilities and/or services, or
23.10.3.3. Executing a enforceable development which guarantees the
construction of all necessary public facilities and/or services at the time the
impacts of development occur.
If a mitigation solution is agreed upon by the city and applicant, the Administrative
Official shall render a finding of compliance and capacity will be reserved. If an
applicant refuses to mitigate in a manner acceptable to the City, the Administrative
Official will render a finding of non-compliance and a final development order shall
be withheld. An applicant may appeal the City's finding and determination to the
City Commission.
Sec. 23.10.4. PAYMENT IN LIEU OF DEDICATION.
The petitioner may be permitted, after review and recommendation by the City Staff,
to dedicate or make payment-in-lieu of dedication, as part of the development order,
LDR 23 - 20
for the purpose of securing easements for public utility systems, setbacks and rightof-
ways for traffic circulation systems, and provisions for open space and for
meeting applicable level of service standards.
Sec. 23.10.5. REPLACEMENT.
Any proposed development that will utilize components of the existing infrastructure
system that has been determined to need replacement within 5 years of the date of
issuance of the development order to maintain the applicable adopted level of
service standards, shall be required to replace or pay the proportionate costs for
replacement.
Sec. 23.10.6. APPEALS.
The decision of the Administrative Official is final but may be appealed in writing to
the City Commission by either the applicant or the City Staff by filing notice of the
appeal within 30 calendar days of the rendering of the Administrative Official
decision. The City Commission may affirm, modify, or uphold the decision of the
Administrative Official or remand the matter to the Administrative Official for further
review. The decision of the City Commission shall be based upon the concurrency
requirement and accepted engineering and planning principles and shall be
rendered within 45 days after the close of the City Commission hearing on the
appeal.
