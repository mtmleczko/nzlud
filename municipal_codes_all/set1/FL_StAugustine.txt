PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of St. Augustine, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1964 Code, as supplemented through August 13, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1964 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Ronald K. McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to City Attorney Geoffrey B. Dobson, City Clerk Paula B. Owens and the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER LAWS[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The City of St. Augustine was originally incorporated by the Territorial Acts of 1822, pages 86, 87. Since that incorporation it was reincorporated in 1824, 1889, 1915, 1921, 1923 and 1925, when the present Charter, Chapter 11148, was enacted. 
Part I of the Code is made up of the Charter Laws of the City as amended or supplemented. 
The editors in compiling the existing charter laws have in many instances moved sections into more significant article headings. Except as stated, no material within the sections has been disturbed and appears here as recorded in the official journal in the Secretary of State's office. The section, subsection and paragraph numbering and lettering of this compilation of the Charter and amendments have been supplied by the editors, as well as catchlines and article headings. The true identification of each section as to its chapter and section number appears in parentheses at the end of each section. All sections that are no longer effective have been superseded or that consist of mere legislative dicta have been omitted. All words, phrases, corrections, etc., other than placement of statutory references in a uniform style supplied by the editors in the actual body of any section are placed in brackets, or are noted in editor's notes. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. 
A comparative table immediately following the Charter compilation shows the disposition of each section herein.

Effective October 1, 1993, the contributions made by each member to the fund, including installment payments deducted from a member's salary to purchase additional creditable service pursuant to Section 10.02(b) and (c), shall be designated as city contributions in accordance with Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, and shall be excluded from the member's gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered member contributions. In addition, the city shall make a contribution of one (1) percent of the salary of each member which shall be paid over to the board. Effective March 1, 2000 the city shall make a total contribution of two and one-half (2.5) percent of the salary of each member which shall be paid over to the board. 
(4)  If a member recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the plan. 
(5)  For members who retire from active employment and begin receiving benefits prior to March 1, 2000 a temporary supplemental retirement allowance shall be paid the retirant if his date of retirement precedes his sixty-fifth birth date. The amount of temporary supplemental retirement allowance shall be equal to the retirant's credited service, multiplied by one-half of one (0.50) percent of his average final compensation. The temporary supplemental retirement allowance terminates upon the retirant's attainment of age sixty-five (65) years or his prior death. 
(6)  A member who terminates employment on or after March 1, 2000 may elect one of the following early retirement options based on age and years of creditable service at retirement: 
(a)  A member with at least 10 years of creditable service who has reached age 50 may retire with an early retirement benefit equal to 2.0% of average final compensation multiplied by years of creditable service, with a reduction of three percent (3%) for each year by which the member's age at early retirement precedes the normal service retirement date. 
(7)  A member with ten (10) or more years of creditable service who terminates employment on or after October 1, 2005 shall earn a retirement benefit equal to three percent (3%) of average final salary for each year of creditable service worked after October 1, 2005. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the three percent (3%) multiplier shall also apply to creditable service earned by such members prior to October 1, 2005, as follows: 
(a)  For members with less than twenty (20) years of creditable service on October 1, 2005, the three percent (3%) multiplier shall apply to two (2) years of creditable service earned prior to October 1, 2005 for each one (1) year of creditable service worked after October 1, 2005, up to the member's total number of years of creditable service or the maximum number of years of creditable service, if any, allowed by the Plan, whichever is less. 
(b)  For members with twenty (20) or more years of creditable service on October 1, 2005, the three percent (3%) multiplier shall apply to four (4) years of creditable service earned prior to October 1, 2005 for each of the first two years of creditable service worked after October 1, 2005; and the three percent (3%) multiplier shall apply to two (2) years of creditable service earned prior to October 1, 2005 for each year worked thereafter, up to the member's total number of years of creditable service or the maximum number of years of creditable service, if any, allowed by the Plan, whichever is less. 
(8)  Distribution of a member's benefit under this Plan must commence no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year during which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the Employer. 
(Ord. No. 99-30, § 1, 10-25-99; Ord. No. 00-05, § 4, 2-28-00; Ord. No. 04-19, § 2, 10-25-04; Ord. No. 06-02, § 4, 1-23-06; Ord. No. 10-33, § 3, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 10.09. - Optional modes of pension. 
(1)  Each member shall have the right at any time at least two (2) years prior to actual retirement to elect to have his pension payable under any one of the options set forth in this section in lieu of the pension otherwise payable to him upon service retirement under any of the provisions of this Act. The amount of any such optional pension shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such pension otherwise payable to him. The member shall make such an election by written request to the board and this election shall be subject to the approval of the board. 
Option A. Straight life option: A member may elect to receive an increased pension with such pension payments terminating immediately upon the death of the member. 
Option B. Joint and last survivor option: A member may elect to receive a modified pension payable to the member during the joint lifetime of the member and a joint pensioner designated by the member, and following the death of either of them, one hundred (100) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to the survivor for the lifetime of the survivor. 
Option C. Such other amount and form of retirement payments of benefit as, in the opinion of the board of trustees, will best meet the circumstances of the retiring member. 
(2)  The election by a member of any one of the options stated in this section 9 [10.09] shall be null and void if the member dies prior to retirement; provided, however, that Option A and Option B above shall not be voided in event a member continues in employment subsequent to becoming eligible for service retirement and dies prior to actual retirement. The election by a member of Option B above shall be null and void if the person designated to receive last survivor benefits by the member dies before the member's actual retirement. 
(3)  A member who has elected any one of the options stated in this section 9 [10.09] may, at any time within the period provided for such election, revoke any election by written notification to the board. 
(4)  This subsection (4) applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(a)  For a member eligible for service retirement who elects to receive a single-sum payment or equal installments over a period of less than ten (10) years, an "eligible rollover distribution" is that portion of the single sum or installment that represents city contributions under Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, to the extent that it exceeds the required minimum distribution, if applicable, under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(b)  For a member or surviving spouse who receives a refund of accumulated contributions under section 10.11(4) hereof, an "eligible rollover contribution" is that portion of the accumulated contributions that represents the city contributions under Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(c)  An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. 
(d)  A "distributee" includes a member or former member, or a member's or former member's, surviving spouse. 
(e)  A "direct rollover" is a payment by the system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(5)  If a member elects an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change the designated joint pensioner up to two times. The consent of a member's joint pensioner or of the board of trustees to any such change shall not be required. The amount of the retirement income payable to the member upon designation of a new joint pensioner shall be actuarially redetermined by the application of actuarial tables and calculations to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current benefit and that there is no impact to the plan. Each such designation will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board of trustees and on completion will be filed with the board of trustees. In the event that no joint pensioner survives the member, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the member subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid to the member's estate. 
(Ord. No. 99-30, § 1, 10-25-99; Ord. No. 10-33, § 4, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 10.10. - Disability retirement. 
(1)  A police officer will be considered totally disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, he is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient service as a police officer. A member may become eligible for disability retirement on his disability retirement date provided such eligibility is approved by resolution of the board. Such member may retire from the service of the city under the plan if he becomes totally and permanently disabled as defined in subsection (2), by reason of any cause other than a cause set out in subsection (3), on or after the effective date of the plan. Such retirement shall herein be referred to as disability retirement. 
(2)  The benefit payable to a police officer who retires from the service of the city with a total and permanent disability as a result of a disability commencing prior to his normal retirement date is the monthly income payable for ten (10) years certain and life for which, if the police officer's disability occurred in the line of duty, his monthly benefit shall be the accrued retirement benefit, but shall not be less than forty-two (42) percent of his average monthly compensation as of his disability retirement date. If the disability is other than in the line of duty, the police officer's monthly benefit shall be the accrued normal retirement benefit, but shall not be less than twenty-five (25) percent of his average monthly compensation as of his disability retirement date. 
(3)  The monthly retirement income to which a police officer is entitled in the event of his disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement (the "disability retirement date"), and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. 
(4)  Upon termination of a member's monthly disability pension because of recovery from such disability, and provided he reenters active employment as a police officer one year after such recovery, he shall continue to be a member of the system and shall thereafter make his required contributions to the fund. In such event the member's creditable service credit for service as a police officer prior to his disability retirement shall be restored but he shall not receive creditable service credit for the period of his disability, nor for any periods for which he did not make regular contributions. Should the member fail to reenter active employment as a police officer within one year after recovery from disability his membership under this system shall terminate. 
(5)  Once each year following the disability retirement of a member who is receiving a monthly disability pension, the board may require such member to undergo a medical examination conducted by a duly qualified physician appointed by the board. Following such medical examination, the board may determine whether the member is capable of performing useful and efficient service as a police officer [and if he is,] the board shall order his disability pension discontinued. Should the member refuse to submit to any medical examination required by the board, his monthly disability pension shall be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal, and should such refusal continue for one year, all his rights to any further disability pension shall cease and his membership under the system shall thereupon terminate. 
(6)  No member shall be eligible for disability retirement whose disability was incurred while committing a felony. 
(7)  Disability in the line of duty. Any condition or impairment of health of any and all police officers employed in the city caused by hypertension, heart disease, hardening of the arteries, or any condition set forth in section 112.181, Florida Statutes, resulting in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to be accidental and suffered in the line of duty unless the contrary be shown by competent evidence. Any condition or impairment of health caused directly or proximately by exposure, which exposure occurred in the active performance of duty at some definite time or place without willful negligence on the part of the police officer, resulting in total or partial disability, shall be presumed to be accidental and suffered in the line of duty; provided however, that such police officer shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering such service, which physical examination including electrocardiogram failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable under or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. This section shall be applicable to all police officers employed in the city only with reference to pension and retirement benefits under this system. 
(Ord. No. 99-30, § 1, 10-25-99; Ord. No. 00-24, § 6, 6-26-00) 
Sec. 10.11. - Benefits upon death or termination. 
(1)  Each member shall name a beneficiary to receive any benefits payable upon the member's death, such designation to be made on a form provided by the board. A member may change his designation of the beneficiary from time to time in the same manner. 
(2)  In event a member who has elected Option B under section 9 [10.09] dies subsequent to his normal service retirement date but while still employed as a police officer, in lieu of any other benefit payable hereunder by reason of death, there shall be payable to his beneficiary the same monthly pension that would otherwise have been payable under Option B if the member had retired on his normal service retirement date. 
(3)  Should a member's death occur prior to his normal service retirement date, or after his normal service retirement date and before reaching his delayed service retirement death, unless such death occurs following disability retirement as provided in section 10 [10.10], there shall be paid to his beneficiary a monthly pension which shall commence on the first day of the calendar month next following the death of the member and shall continue to be paid each month thereafter for a period equal to the lesser of one hundred twenty (120) months or the life expectancy of the beneficiary. The amount of such monthly pension shall be the accrued benefit of the member as of the date of death. In the event of the member's death following disability retirement, the provisions of section 10 [10.10] shall be operative. 
(4)  If the employment of any member who has not completed ten (10) years of creditable service is terminated other than by service retirement or death, such member shall be entitled to a refund of one hundred (100) percent of his accumulated contribution made to the fund without interest. Any such terminated member may leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period not exceeding five (5) years pending reemployment, and upon reemployment as a police officer within said five (5) years, all creditable service credit under the system for his last period of employment shall be restored. Any such member who fails to be reemployed as a police officer within five (5) years shall be refunded one hundred percent of his contributions to the fund, without interest, and all prior creditable service credit shall be forfeited should he be reemployed at a later date. Upon payment of the accumulated contributions as herein provided, the membership of such terminated member shall thereupon cease and no further benefits shall be payable under the system. That portion of a terminated member's benefit that is not vested shall be forfeited and used only to reduce future costs of the system. 
(5)  Any other provision of the Act notwithstanding any member who has completed ten (10) years of creditable service at such time as employment as a police officer is terminated shall be entitled to a monthly pension, provided such member shall not withdraw his accumulated contributions. Such monthly pension shall commence on the first day of any calendar month coinciding with or following the member's otherwise early or normal service retirement date and shall continue to be paid each month thereafter as though the member had retired under the provisions of section 10.08 of this Act. Benefits shall be distributed or shall commence to the member not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment, and shall be paid: 
(a)  Over the lifetime of the member or the lifetimes of the member and beneficiary; or 
(b)  Over a period not exceeding the joint life expectancy of the member and beneficiary. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a retiree may change his or her designation of beneficiary up to two times without the approval of the Board or the current beneficiary. 
(7)  If a member dies on or after January 1, 2007 while performing Qualified Military Service as defined by USERRA, the member's beneficiaries shall be entitled to any benefits the member would have been entitled to had he or she resumed employment and then died while employed. 
(Ord. No. 99-30, § 1, 10-25-99; Ord. No. 10-33, § 5, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 10.12. - Miscellaneous. 
(1)  The authority having the power to hire the services of a police officer shall prepare such records and from time to time shall furnish such information concerning a member as the board may require in the discharge of its duties. Upon the employment of a police officer, the authority shall inform the police officer of his duties and obligations in connection with the system as a condition of employment. 
(2)  Should any change or error in records result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the system more or less than he would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, than on discovery of any such error the board shall correct the same and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(3)  All pensions and other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this Act, and the accumulated contributions and cash securities in the funds created under this Act, are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment, or any other process whatever, nor shall any assignment thereof be enforceable in any court. 
(4)  All provisions of any ordinance of the City inconsistent with the provisions of Article X hereof, are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistencies. 
(5)  If this Act shall later be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(6)  In the event of a complete discontinuance of contributions to the fund or upon termination of the system, the interest of each member in the system to the extent then funded shall become one hundred (100) percent nonforfeitable, and the assets of the system shall be apportioned and distributed in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 185.37, as amended. 
(7)  If any clause, section or provision of this Act shall be declared to be unconstitutional or invalid for any cause or reason, the same shall be eliminated from this Act, and the remaining portion of said Act shall be in force and effect, and shall be as valid as if such invalid portion had not been incorporated. 
(8)  Vested rights which may exist on the effective date of this Act in favor of any member of the existing retirement system under F.S. ch. 185 shall not be impaired; provided, that any person who may claim that the abolishment of the retirement system under said F.S. ch. 185 violates a claimed vested right thereunder, shall, within one year of the effective date of this Act, notify the board in writing of such claim. Upon receipt of such claim the board shall, without delay, in an appropriate proceeding and forum, obtain a judicial construction with respect to the question of such claim of violated vested rights. Should the final judgment or decree in said proceeding sustain the claim of any such person, the board shall conform its administration of the fund in relation to such person to meet with the requirements of any such decree or judgment. 
(9)  Any person who shall knowingly make any false statement or shall falsify or permit to be falsified any record or records of the system in any attempt to defraud the system shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and be subject to punishment as provided by law. 
(10)  The board of trustees is hereby authorized to grant periodic cost-of-living adjustments to benefits payable to all retired members, including members who are participating in the deferred retirement option program in accordance with section 10.13, during the continuation of benefits being payable under this plan; however, such adjustment shall not be made more frequently than on an annual basis. The conditions for granting such adjustments are as follows: 
(a)  The granting of same is actuarially sound and will not substantially affect the financial stability of the plan and will not require additional funding of the plan from any city funds from any source apart from funds received as tax levy proceeds authorized by F.S. ch. 185.08. 
(b)  The board shall formally approve the adjustments based on data contained in the current actuarial evaluation. 
(c)  The adjustment shall be divided into a "prefunded" component and an "ad hoc" component such that, once approved and for the purpose of the actuarial evaluations, the prefunded percentage increase will be assumed to be repeated on an annual basis for future years and the ad hoc increase will not be assumed to be repeated on an annual basis for future years. Future actuarial evaluations may determine that a modification to the assumed future prefunded increases will be necessary. 
(d)  Prefunded adjustments shall be based upon the monthly benefit being paid to a retirant on the month preceding the adjustment date, but excluding any temporary supplemental retirement allowances paid according to section 10.08(5). The average cost-of-living index, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor relative to the United States as a whole, shall be consideration for such adjustments. However, in no event shall the percentage for the prefunded component of the annual cost-of-living adjustment exceed two (2) percent for any annual adjustment date, nor shall any retiree's benefit be reduced below any benefit being received on March 1, 2000. 
(e)  The ad hoc component of the cost-of-living adjustment may be granted only when surplus funds are available within the plan and only if all other provisions of this section are satisfied. This portion of the adjustment shall be based upon the monthly benefit being paid to a retirant on the month preceding the adjustment date but excluding any temporary supplemental and retirement allowances paid according to section 10.08(5). The sum of the prefunded and ad hoc portions of the adjustment shall not exceed either three (3) percent or the average cost-of-living index as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, relative to the United States as a whole, whichever is the lesser amount. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Subsection (10), paragraphs (a) through (e), members who retire before March 1, 2000 shall receive an annual cost of living adjustment of up to three (3) percent. Up to two (2) percent of this cost of living adjustment will be part of the fixed benefit structure of the plan. The remaining amount (up to one percent annually) will be granted pursuant to the "ad hoc" adjustment provisions of this subsection. Members who retire on or after March 1, 2000 will be eligible for a cost of living adjustment in accordance with the foregoing provisions of Subsection (10), paragraphs (a) through (e). Cost of living adjustments may be adjusted in accordance with Section 10.07(1). 
(11)  Maximum benefit limitation. 
(a)  The maximum annual benefit payable under the system shall be limited to ninety-thousand dollars ($90,000.00) subject to adjustment for increases in the cost of living in accordance with the following sentence. As of the first day of January of each calendar year, the maximum dollar limitation shall be adjusted automatically to an amount determined by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service effective for that calendar year and shall apply only to that calendar year. 
Retirees in payment status whose benefits were limited in any year by the application of this limitation shall have their benefits adjusted automatically in subsequent years to take into account the then current dollar limit. 
(b)  In the event a member has earned a benefit, which during a previous limitation year has met all the requirements of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"), and if the member's accrued benefit exceeds the limitation of Section 415 of the Code or the current limitation year, the member's maximum annual benefit, as described in subsection (a) of this section, shall not be less than the accrued benefit allowable under such previous limitation year. 
(c)  If the retirement benefit is payable in a form other than a straight-life annuity or a joint-and-survivor annuity with the spouse as joint annuitant, the annual benefit limitation in any year shall be the actuarial equivalent (as defined in subsection (f) of this section) of the maximum annual benefit for that year (payable in the form of a straight-life annuity), as described above. 
(d)  In the event payment of a retirement benefit under the system to a member commences prior to the date he (she) attains age sixty-two (62), the maximum annual benefit limitation shall be adjusted to be not more than the actuarial equivalent (as defined in subsection (f) of this section) of the then current dollar limit assumed to commence at age sixty-two (62) for the purpose of applying the benefit limit described in subsection (a) of this section. For a "qualified participant" as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b)(2)(H), this paragraph shall not apply. 
For years subsequent to the payment commencement year, benefits payable shall be limited to the actuarial equivalent (as defined in subsection (f) of this section), determined as of the benefit commencement date, of the subsequent year's dollar limit assumed to commence at age sixty-two (62) (or the then current age if greater). 
Adjustments described in this subsection (d) shall not reduce the maximum annual benefit below seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), if the retirement benefit commences on or after attainment of age 55, or if the benefit commences before age 55, the actuarial equivalent of the $75,000 limitation for age 55. 
(e)  In the event payment of a retirement benefit under the system to a member commences after the date he (she) attains age 65, the maximum benefit limitation shall be adjusted to be not more than the actuarial equivalent (as defined in subsection (f) of this section) of the then current dollar limit commencing at age 65 for the purpose of applying the benefit limit described in subsection (a) of this section. 
For years subsequent to the payment commencement year, benefits payable shall be limited to the actuarial equivalent, determined as of the benefit commencement date, of the subsequent year's dollar limit assumed to commence at age 65. 
(f)  For the purpose of adjusting benefits in accordance with this section, actuarial equivalent shall be determined using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table and an interest rate of five (5) percent for adjustments under subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section. For adjustment under subsections (c), (d) and (e), no cost-of-living adjustment shall be taken into account before the year for which such adjustment first takes effect. 
(g)  If a retirement benefit is payable to a member who has less than ten (10) years of participation in the system, the limitation described in subsection (a) of this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(h)  If the city maintains a tax-qualified, defined contribution plan covering the same member, the total of such member's "defined contribution fraction" and his (her) "defined benefit fraction" (both as defined in Section 415 of the Code) at the end of any limitation year shall not exceed one (1.0). If as reduction in a member's benefits is required so that the sum of the two (2) fractions described above will not exceed one (1.0) the numerator of the "defined benefit fraction" shall be adjusted downward sufficiently to insure that the two-plan limitation described above is not exceeded. This limitation shall not be applicable to plan years beginning on and after January 1, 2000. 
(i)  Adjustments described in subsections (b) and (d) of this section 10.12(11) shall not apply to (i) income received as a pension, annuity or similar allowance as a result of personal injuries or sickness or (ii) amounts received as a result of an employee's death by the employee's beneficiaries, survivors or estate. 
(Ord. No. 99-30, § 1, 10-25-99; Ord. No. 00-05, § 5, 2-28-00; Ord. No. 09-07, § 1, 3-9-09; Ord. No. 10-33, § 6, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 10.13. - Deferred retirement option program for police officers (DROP). 
(1)  A deferred retirement option plan ("DROP") is hereby established for eligible police officers, effective October 1, 2004. 
(2)  Eligibility and participation: 
(a)  A police officer who is actively employed by the city and reaches the normal service retirement date shall be eligible to participate in the DROP. 
(b)  A member's election to participate in the DROP shall be irrevocable 
(c)  An eligible member may participate in the DROP for a maximum of sixty (60) months from the date the DROP plan takes effect (if the member is eligible at that time), or for a maximum of sixty (60) months from the date the member reaches his or her earliest normal service retirement date, whichever occurs first. An eligible member may elect to participate in the DROP with thirty (30) days advance written notice to the city. An eligible member may defer entry into DROP beyond the date the member is first eligible to enter the DROP. If a member defers entry into the DROP, the maximum DROP period will be reduced for each month of deferred entry. In no event will the maximum DROP period be extended beyond sixty (60) months from the date the member is first eligible to participate. Example: A member is eligible to participate in DROP for a maximum sixty (60) months from the date the member is first eligible to participate; however, if the member defers entry into the DROP for twelve months after reaching the earliest normal service retirement age (or if the member has already reached the earliest normal service retirement age at the time the DROP takes effect, twelve months after that date), the member will be able to participate in the DROP for a maximum of forty-eight (48) months. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, any member who completes twenty-five (25) years of service before age fifty-two (52) may defer entry into the DROP until age 52, with no reduction in the DROP period. A member who elects to participate in the DROP can elect to terminate DROP participation and city employment sooner than the maximum DROP period, with thirty (30) days advance written notice to the city. 
(3)  DROP plan features: 
(a)  An eligible member who elects to participate in the DROP will be considered to have retired for purposes of the pension plan. The member's monthly retirement benefit, determined in accordance with the plan based on years of creditable service and average final compensation at the time the member enters the DROP, will be paid into his or her DROP account every month during the DROP period. No member or city contributions shall be required after a member enters the DROP, and the member will not accrue any additional creditable service or any additional benefits under the pension plan after entering the DROP. 
(b)  A member who elects to participate in the DROP shall not be eligible for disability or preretirement death benefits under the pension plan. 
(c)  As a condition of participating in the DROP, the member must agree to resign from city employment at the conclusion of the DROP period and must submit an irrevocable letter of resignation prior to entering the DROP. 
(d)  Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment, and DROP participants will be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(e)  The member's DROP account will earn interest at an annual rate of six and one-half percent (6.5%) compounded monthly. 
(f)  Within thirty (30) days following a DROP participant's termination of city employment or death, the member's entire DROP account balance shall be distributed to the member [or in the event of the member's death, to the member's designated beneficiary or estate in accordance with paragraph (g) below] in a cash lump sum, unless the member elects to have all or any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the member in a direct rollover. Any such direct rollover will be accomplished in accordance with section 10.09 (4) of the pension plan.

(Ord. No. 04-19, § 4, 10-25-04) 
Sec. 10.15. - Maximum pension benefits. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(2)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
(3)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(a)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(b)  Any other benefit not required under §415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1). 
(4)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
(a)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(b)  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(c)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(a)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(b)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the City, the adjustments provided for in (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(c)  The reductions provided for in (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 66-218, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-217. 
(d)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than ten (10) years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the City shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below 10%. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to section 66-218, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-217. 
(7)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000) limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the City has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(9)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures to defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(a)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 66-227 and 66-228, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b); or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
3.  For purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)a., the System will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph c., and for purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)b. the System will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph c. 
(b)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit- 
1.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan. 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(c)  For purposes of applying the limits in this subsection (j), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a calendar year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)). 
1.  However, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the calendar year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the calendar year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
a.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee which the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
b.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c) -2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (j)(4)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution 
(11)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary. 
(a)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(b)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code.

    In accordance with F.S. § 185.35(6), a defined contribution plan component ("share plan") is hereby established for police officers as part of this System. The share plan will be funded exclusively with F.S. ch. 185 premium tax revenues in accordance with the default rules in F.S. § 185.35(a)-(d) as follows: all annual premium tax revenues received up to the amount collected in 2002 and distributed to the city in 2003 ($249,401) shall be used to reduce city pension contributions. Annual premium tax revenues received in excess of $249,401 shall be split 50-50, with one-half of the excess used to fund the share plan, and one-half of the excess used to reduce city pension contributions. The share plan shall not become operative until annual premium tax revenues exceed $249,401 and the details of the share plan are agreed to by the city and union.

ARTICLE XVI. - SLUM CLEARANCE AND URBAN RENEWAL 

Sec. 16.01. - Findings and declarations of necessity. 
    It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the City of St. Augustine slum and blighted areas (as herein defined) which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of said municipality; that the existence of such areas contribute substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability, imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of said municipality, retards the provisions of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of slums and blight is a matter of public policy and concern in order that the said municipality shall not continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of its revenues because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization and other forms of public protection, services and facilities. 
    It is further found and declared that certain slum or blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this Act, since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this Act, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated, remedied or prevented; and that the salvageable slum and blighted areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action as herein authorized, and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas. 
    It is further found and declared that the powers conferred by this Act are for public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and the power of eminent domain and police power exercised; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions herein enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 61-2739, § 1) 
Sec. 16.02. - Encouragement of private enterprises. 
    The City of St. Augustine, to the greatest extent it determines to be feasible in carrying out the provisions of this Act, shall afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of said municipality as a whole, to the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the urban renewal area by private enterprise. The City shall give consideration to this objective in exercising its powers under this Act, including the formation of a workable program, the approval of urban renewal plans (consistent with the general plan of the municipality), the exercise of its zoning powers, the enforcement of other laws, codes and regulations relating to the use of land and the use and occupancy of buildings and improvements, the disposition of any property acquired, and the provision of necessary public improvements. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 61-2739, § 2) 
Sec. 16.03. - Workable program. 
    The City of St. Augustine for the purposes of this Act may formulate for the municipality a workable program for utilizing appropriate private and public resources to eliminate and prevent the development or spread of slums and urban blight, to encourage needed urban rehabilitation, to provide for the redevelopment of slum and blighted areas, or to undertake such of the aforesaid activities or other feasible municipal activities as may be suitably employed to achieve the objectives of such workable program. Such workable program may include, without limitation, provision for: the prevention of the spread of blight, into areas of the municipality, which are free from blight through diligent enforcement of housing, zoning and occupancy controls and standards; the rehabilitation or conservation of slum and blighted areas or portions thereof by replanning, removing congestion, providing parks, playgrounds and other public improvements, by encouraging voluntary rehabilitation and by compelling the repair and rehabilitation of deteriorated or deteriorating structures; and the clearance and redevelopment of slum and blighted areas or portions thereof. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 61-2739, § 3) 
Sec. 16.04. - Finding of necessity by the city commission. 
    The City of St. Augustine shall not exercise the authority hereafter conferred by this Act until after the City Commission shall have adopted a resolution finding that: (1) one or more slum or blighted areas in such municipality; and (2) the rehabilitation, conservation, redevelopment, or a combination thereof, of such area or areas is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, morals or welfare of the residents of such municipality. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 61-2739, § 4) 
Sec. 16.05. - Preparation and approval of urban renewal projects and urban renewal plan. 
(a)  The City of St. Augustine shall not approve an urban renewal project for an urban renewal area unless the City Commission has, by resolution, determined such area to be a slum area or a blighted area or a combination thereof and designated such area as appropriate for an urban renewal project. Said City Commission shall not approve an urban renewal plan until a general plan for the municipality has been prepared. For this purpose and other municipal purposes, authority is hereby vested in said municipality to prepare, to adopt and to revise from time to time, a general plan for the physical development of the municipality as a whole (giving due regard to the environs and metropolitan surroundings), to establish and maintain a planning commission for such purpose and related municipal planning activities, and to make available and to appropriate necessary funds therefor. Said municipality shall not acquire real property for an urban renewal project unless the City Commission has approved the urban renewal project in accordance with subsection (d) hereof and the project has been approved by a referendum as provided in subsection (f) hereof. 
(b)  The municipality may itself prepare or cause to be prepared an urban renewal plan, or any person or agency, public or private, may submit such a plan to said municipality. Prior to its approval of an urban renewal project, the City Commission shall submit such plan to the planning commission of the municipality, if any, for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the municipality as a whole. The planning commission shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed urban renewal plan to said City Commission within thirty (30) days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning commission or, if no recommendations are received within said thirty (30) days, then without such recommendations, said City Commission may proceed with the hearing on the proposed urban renewal project prescribed by subsection (c) hereof. 
(c)  The City Commission shall hold a public hearing on an urban renewal project, after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation of the municipality. The notice shall describe the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing, shall generally identify the urban renewal area covered by the plan, and shall outline the general scope of the urban renewal project under consideration. 
(d)  Following such hearing, the City Commission may approve an urban renewal project if it finds that (1) a feasible method exists for the location of families who will be displaced from the urban renewal area in decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within their means and without undue hardship to such families; (2) the urban renewal plan conforms to the general plan of the municipality as a whole; and (3) the urban renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the urban renewal area by private enterprise; provided, that if the urban renewal area consists of an area of open land to be acquired by the municipality, such area shall not be so acquired unless (1) if it is to be developed for residential uses, said City Commission shall determine that a shortage of housing of sound standards and design which is decent, safe and sanitary exists in the municipality; that the need for housing accommodations has been or will be increased as a result of the clearance of slums in other areas (including other portions of the urban renewal area); that the conditions of blight in the area and the shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing cause or contribute to an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare; and the acquisition of the area for residential uses is an integral part of and essential to the program of the municipality, or (2) if it is to be developed for nonresidential uses, the local governing body shall determine that such nonresidential uses are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper growth and development of the community in accordance with sound planning standards and local community objectives, which acquisition may require the exercise of governmental action, as provided in this Act, because of defective or unusual conditions of title, diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, improper subdivisions, outmoded street patterns, deterioration of site, economic disuse, unsuitable topography or faulty lot layouts, the need for the correlation of the area with other areas of the municipality by streets and modern traffic requirements or any combination of such factors or other conditions which retard development of the area. 
(e)  An urban renewal plan may be modified at any time: Provided that if modified after the lease or sale by the municipality of real property in the urban renewal project area, such modification may be conditioned upon such approval of the owner, lessee or successor in interest as the municipality may deem advisable and in any event shall be subject to such rights at law or in equity as a lessee or purchaser, or his successor or successors in interest, may be entitled to assert. 
(f)  Upon approval by the municipality of an urban renewal plan or of any modification thereof the municipality shall call a special election within thirty (30) days and refer final decision on whether or not to proceed with the specific urban renewal project according to said plan or modification, to the electors of the municipality. Upon approval by a majority of the duly qualified electors voting in said special election of the decision to proceed with the specific urban renewal plan or modification, such plan or modification shall be deemed to be in full force and effect for the respective urban renewal area and the municipality may then cause such plan or modification to be carried out in accordance with its terms. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, where the City Commission certifies that an area is in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm or other catastrophe, respecting which the Governor of the State has certified the need for disaster assistance under Public Law 875, Eighty-first Congress, or other Federal law, the City Commission may approve an urban renewal plan and an urban renewal project with respect to such area without regard to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section and the provisions of this section requiring a general plan for the municipality and a public hearing on the urban renewal project.

Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this Act shall be fully negotiable. 
(f)  If any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of any bond issued under this Act or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the municipality in connection with an urban renewal project, as herein defined, shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for such purpose and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

Sec. 2-182. - Security of bondholders. 
    Any revenue bonds issued under the provision of this division shall be secured by a trust agreement by and between the city and a corporate trustee or trustees, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such revenue bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received or proceeds of any contract or contracts pledged and may convey or mortgage the project or any portion thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such revenue bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including particularly such provisions as have hereinabove been specifically authorized to be included in any resolution or resolution of the city authorizing revenue bonds thereof. Any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues or other moneys may furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the city. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee or trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the city commission may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

(b)  A sufficient amount of the revenues derived in respect of a project, except such part of such revenues as may be necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide reserves and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any revenue bonds of the city or in the trust agreement securing the same shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or trust agreement in a sinking or other similar fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the rates, rents, fees and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the city shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the city, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the city. 
(c)  The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking or other similar fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking or other similar fund shall be a fund for all such revenue bonds issued to finance projects at a particular institution for higher education and for the revenue bonds issued to finance a particular project and may, additionally, permit and provide for the issuance of revenue bonds having a subordinate lien in respect of the security herein authorized to other revenue bonds of the city and, in such case, the city may create separate sinking or other similar funds in respect of such subordinate lien bonds.

(Ord. No. 93-34, § 13, 9-27-93) 
Sec. 2-187. - Alternate means. 
    The foregoing sections of this division shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby, and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws; provided the issuance of revenue bonds and revenue refunding bonds under the provisions of this division need not comply with the requirements of any other ordinance of the city applicable to the issuance of bonds. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this division or by general law, none of the powers granted to the city commission under the provisions of the division shall be subject to the supervision or regulation or require the approval or consent of any municipality or political subdivision or any commission, board, body, bureau, official or agency thereof or of state.

(Ord. No. 94-27, § 1, 10-24-94) 
Sec. 2-215. - Contractor disciplinary proceedings. 
(a)  Investigation by planning and building department. The planning and building department, acting on behalf of the City of St. Augustine, Florida (the "city"), shall cause to be investigated any complaint which is filed before it if the complaint is in writing, signed by the complainant, and legally sufficient. A complaint is legally sufficient if it contains ultimate facts which show that a violation of this Code, of any of the practice acts relating to the building contractors regulated by the department of business and professional regulation (the "department") or the city, or of any rule promulgated by the department, the city or a regulatory board in the department has occurred. Prior to finding legal sufficiency, the city may require supporting information or documentation as necessary to determine legal sufficiency. The city may investigate or continue to investigate, and the city may take appropriate final action on a complaint even though the original complainant withdraws it or otherwise indicates his desire not to cause the complaint to be investigated or prosecuted to completion. The city may investigate any anonymous complaint if the complaint is in writing and is legally sufficient, if the alleged violation of law or rules is substantial, and if the city has reason to believe, after preliminary inquiry, that the alleged violations in the complaint are true. The city may investigate a complaint made by a confidential informant if the complaint is legally sufficient, if the alleged violation of law or rule is substantial, and if the city has reason to believe, after preliminary inquiry, that the allegations of the complainant are true. Unless a complaint has been filed with the city or the city has been specifically authorized by statute, the city may not initiate an investigation unless it has reasonable cause to believe that a licensee or a group of licensees has violated a Florida Statute, a rule of the department, a rule or ordinance of the city, or a rule of a board. When an investigation of any person is undertaken, the city shall promptly furnish to the person or his attorney a copy of the complaint or document which resulted in the initiation of the investigation. The person may submit a written response to the information contained in such complaint or document within twenty (20) days after service to the person of the complaint or document. The person's written response shall be considered by the planning and building director (the "director"). However, if the city manager agrees in writing that such notification would be detrimental to the investigation, the city may withhold notification. The city may conduct an investigation without notification to any person if the act under investigation is a criminal offense. 
(b)  Determination of probable cause. The director shall make his determination of probable cause within thirty (30) days after receipt by him of the final investigative report of the city. The city manager may grant extensions of the thirty-day time limit. If the director does not find probable cause within the thirty-day time limit, as may be extended, or if the director finds no probable cause, the city manager may determine, within ten (10) days after the director fails to determine probable cause or ten (10) days after the time limit has elapsed, that probable cause exists. In lieu of a finding of probable cause, the director may issue a letter of guidance to the subject. If the director finds that probable cause exists, he shall direct the city to file a formal complaint against the licensee. The city shall follow the directions of the director regarding the filing of a formal complaint. If directed to do so, the city shall file a formal complaint against the subject of the investigation and prosecute that complaint pursuant to the provisions of section 2-214 hereof. However, the city manager may decide not to prosecute the complaint if he finds that probable cause had been improvidently found by the director. 
(c)  Notification to complainant. The city shall periodically notify the person who filed the complaint of the status of the investigation, whether probable cause has been found, and the status of any civil action or administrative proceeding or appeal. 
(d)  Hearings. A request for a hearing shall be granted or denied within fifteen (15) days of receipt. All parties shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing after reasonable notice of not less than fourteen (14) days. The notice shall include: 
(1)  A statement of the time, place and nature of the hearing. 
(2)  A statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held. 
(3)  A short and plain statement of the matters asserted by the city and by all parties of record at the time notice is given. If the city or any part is unable to state the matters in sufficient detail at the time initial notice is given, the notice may be limited to a statement of the issues involved, and therefore, upon timely written application, a more definite and detailed statement shall be furnished not less than three (3) days prior to the date set for the hearing. 
All parties shall have an opportunity to respond, to present evidence and argument on all issues involved, to conduct cross- examination and submit proposed findings of fact and orders, to file exceptions to any order and to be represented by counsel. When appropriate, the general public may be given an opportunity to present oral or written communications. If the city proposes to consider such material, then all parties shall be given an opportunity to cross-examine or challenge or rebut it. All pleadings, motions or other papers filed in the proceedings must be signed by a party, the party's attorney or the party's qualified representative. The signature of a party or party's attorney or a party's qualified representative constitutes a certificate that he has read the pleading, motion or other paper and that, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, it is not imposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or for frivolous purpose or needless increase in the cost of litigation If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of these requirements, the enforcement board, upon motion or its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the other party or parties the amount of reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee. 
The record in a case governed by this subsection shall consist only of: 
(1)  All notices, pleadings, motions and intermediate rulings. 
(2)  Evidence received or considered. 
(3)  A statement of matters officially recognized. 
(4)  Questions and proffers of proof and objections and rulings thereon. 
(5)  Proposed findings and exceptions. 
(6)  Any decision, opinion, proposed or recommended order, or report by the officer presiding at the hearing. 
(7)  All staff memoranda or data submitted to the enforcement board during the hearing or prior to its disposition, after notice of the submission to all parties. 
(8)  All matters placed on the record after an ex parte communication. 
(9)  The official transcript. 
The city shall, upon the request of any party and at that party's expense, make arrangements to accurately and completely preserve all testimony in the proceeding and, on the request of any party, it shall make a full or partial transcript available at no more than actual cost. At the request of any other party, full or partial transcripts shall be provided at no more than cost. 
Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence of record and on matters officially recognized.

(2)  Reasonable repair and maintenance of nonconforming signs, including change of advertising message, is permitted and is not a change which would terminate the nonconforming status. Reasonable repair and maintenance means the work necessary to keep the sign structure in a state of good repair, including the replacement in kind of materials in the sign structure. Where the replacement of materials is involved, such replacement may not exceed either fifty (50) percent of the structural materials in the sign, or fifty (50) percent of the current fair market value of the sign, within any twelve-month period. "Structural materials" means all those materials incorporated into the sign as load-bearing parts, including vertical supports, horizontal stringers, braces, bracing wires, brackets and catwalks. Structural materials do not include the sign face, any skirt, any electrical service or electric lighting, except in cases where such items have been incorporated into the sign as load-bearing parts. The following are examples of modifications which do not constitute reasonable repair or maintenance and which constitute substantial changes to a nonconforming sign which will result in the loss of nonconforming status: 
a.  Modification which changes the structure of, or the type of structure of, the sign, such as conversion of a back-to-back sign to a V-type or conversion of a wooden sign structure to a metal structure; 
1.  The city may authorize structural alterations to a nonconforming sign in instances where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements or other safety related requirements necessitate alterations, provided that the reconstruction shall not be authorized primarily for the purpose of replacement of deteriorated materials. The city will accept a notice or other writing from OSHA or other regulatory body to the permittee requiring the intended alteration as documentation of safety requirements. If the structural alterations are intended to be made to comply with OSHA regulations, the permittee must submit to the Department a statement in writing citing the OSHA regulation with which the permittee is intending to comply and explaining how the intended alteration is required by the cited OSHA regulation. If the structural alterations are required to comply with building codes applicable to existing structures, the permittee must submit to the city a statement in writing citing the specific requirement of the building code which the alterations are intended to meet. Structural alterations are allowed only if no alternatives are available which address safety requirements. Documentation of the requirements must be submitted to, and approved by, the city prior to making any structural alterations. The location, structural configuration, number of faces, size of the sign faces, sign structure height and the materials used in the sign structure and sign faces must be the same type as those used in the sign prior to approval of the alterations. Structural configuration means the physical arrangement of a sign whether arranged as a single-faced, V-type, back-to-back, side-to-side or stacked sign. During the period of temporary removal for those approved structural alterations, the permittee must permanently display the permit tag at the sign location. 
2.  The addition of a catwalk or other fall protection device for safety reasons, where the device does not increase the structural integrity of the sign or prolong the life of the sign, is allowed without obtaining prior approval from the city. 
b.  Modification which changes the area of the sign facing or the height above ground level (HAGL) of the sign, however: 
1.  Reduction in the area of the sign facing or the HAGL of the sign, which reduction is required by this ordinance, is not a change which would terminate the nonconforming status of the sign, provided like materials are used and no enhancements are made to the visibility of the sign. 
2.  Embellishments may be added to nonconforming signs subject to the limitations regarding size of sign facing and provided they do not exceed ten (10) percent of the area of the sign facing prior to the addition of the embellishment. 
c.  Modification which enhances the visibility of the sign's message, or the period of time that the sign's message is visible; 
d.  Modification which adds automatic changeable faces; or 
e.  Modification which adds artificial lighting or changes the existing lighting such that the illumination to the sign facing is substantially increased. 
(3)  Prohibited modifications need not be physically part of the sign if they have the effect of enhancing the sign's message, the visibility of the message or the period of time the message is visible. However, in such cases, the modifications will not be considered a modification to the sign if: 
a.  The modification is the result of removal, cutting or trimming of vegetation in front of the sign pursuant to a permit for such removal, cutting or trimming from the department; or 
b.  The modification only incidentally affects the visibility of the sign's message, and the bona fide purpose of the modification is unrelated to the sign. 
(4)  A nonconforming sign may not be disassembled and re-erected at the same location except as provided in paragraph (6)(a), below. 
(5)  A nonconforming sign may not be relocated, except to a conforming location. 
(6)  A nonconforming sign may continue to exist so long as it is not destroyed, abandoned or discontinued. "Destroyed," "abandoned" and "discontinued" have the following meanings: 
a.  "Destroyed" means more than fifty (50) percent of the upright supports of a sign structure are physically damaged such that normal repair practices of the industry would call for, in the case of wooden sign structures, replacement of the broken supports and, in the case of a metal sign structure, replacement of at least twenty-five (25) percent of the length above ground of each broken, bent or twisted support. A sign will not be considered "destroyed" within the meaning of this section where the destruction is caused by vandalism or other criminal or tortious act. 
b.  A nonconforming sign is "abandoned" or "discontinued" when a sign structure no longer exists at the permitted location or the sign owner fails to operate and maintain the sign for a period of twelve (12) months or longer. Signs displaying bona fide public interest messages are not 'abandoned' or "discontinued" within the meaning of this section. The following conditions shall be considered failure to operate and maintain the sign: 
1.  Signs displaying only an "available for lease" or similar message; 
2.  Signs displaying advertising for a product or service which is no longer available; 
3.  Signs which are blank or do not identify a particular product, service or facility. 
(l)  Prohibited signs. All signs not expressly permitted under this ordinance, or signs not expressly exempt from permit requirements under this ordinance, are prohibited. Such signs include but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  Signs which physically or visually move, rotate or create an illusion of movement or which have parts or surfaces that physically or visually move, rotate or create the illusion of movement or which emit audible sound or noise; 
(2)  Beacons or any light with one (1) or more beams directed into the atmosphere or directed at one (1) or more points not on the same lot as the light source; 
(3)  Pennants, inflated signs and tethered balloons; 
(4)  Signs painted directly on the exterior surface of a building; 
(5)  On corner lots, signs of a height between two and one-half (21/2) and eight (8) feet above curb grade in a triangular area bounded by the adjacent street right-of-way lines and a straight line joining points on the right-of-way lines which are thirty (30) feet from the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines, except that the distance from the intersection may be reduced to twenty (20) feet along the right-of-way lines where the intersection of the adjacent streets is controlled by a traffic signal; 
(6)  Signs, or any point on a sign, located higher than the roof ridge, the plate of a flat roof or the highest point of the roof; 
(7)  Signs, other than signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental body, that are located in or on a public right-of-way; 
(8)  Signs which appear animated or projected or which are intermittently or intensely illuminated or which are of a traveling, tracing, scrolling or sequential light type or which contain or are illuminated by animated or flashing light; 
(9)  Wall signs located such that any part thereof covers, obstructs or is placed over any existing windows on the same wall or placed above the sills of the first level of windows above the first story on the same wall or placed more than twenty-five (25) feet above grade, except as may otherwise be allowed where a conditional use permit has been granted by the planning and zoning board pursuant to this ordinance; 
(10)  Signs attached to a tree, utility pole, fence or rock; 
(11)  Signs, other than traffic control signs, which use the words "stop," "yield," "caution" and "danger" or which contain red, amber and green lights which may resemble traffic control signs or lights; 
(12)  Billboards and signs unrelated to the principal use or uses of the premises on which the sign is located, except as provided in this ordinance; 
(13)  Illuminated signs which direct the illumination onto adjacent streets or onto property other than the premises on which the sign is located; 
(14)  Signs which resemble city street identification signs; 
(15)  Signs attached to, or painted on, vehicles or trailers which are parked and visible from a street or limited access highway, except where such vehicles or trailers are regularly and customarily used to transport persons, goods or materials as part of the principal use of the premises; 
(16)  Signs which by reason of position, wording, illumination, size, shape or color obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of or may be confused with any traffic control sign, signal or device; and 
(17)  Electronic message center type signs. 
(m)  Violations. Any person violating any section, subsection or requirement of this article shall be guilty of an offense and shall be cited and brought before the code enforcement board.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 5-1. - Applicability; penalties. 
(a)  This chapter is intended to be interpreted and enforced by the City of St. Augustine and St. Johns County, jointly, in accordance with an Interlocal Agreement approved by the St. Johns County Board of Commissioners, and signed by the clerk of the board of county commissioners on October 10, 2005, and approved by the City of St. Augustine through Ordinance No. 2005-31, hereinafter referred to as the "Interlocal Agreement". Any subsequent modifications, revisions, or alterations, to this interlocal agreement or any successor interlocal agreements that are specifically designated to succeed the interlocal agreement referenced herein shall be incorporated by reference. It is the intent of the City of St. Augustine that St. Johns County has jurisdiction within the city limits of the City of St. Augustine to enforce both this chapter and the St. Johns County Animal Code, as adopted through St. Johns County Ordinance No. 2017-36, hereinafter referred to as the "County Animal Code," and any subsequent revisions. It is the intent of the City of St. Augustine to read this chapter in harmony with the provisions of the county animal code, and where possible to reconcile the provisions of both codes to avoid a conflict of law. In the event that the provisions of this chapter clearly conflict with the county animal code, the county administrator, through the Operations Manager of the St. Johns County Division of Animal Control, or any lawfully appointed enforcement officer, shall elect which provision to enforce, and shall clearly so state which provision is being enforced on the face of the citation or other legal or administrative document. Likewise, nothing herein is intended to override or otherwise regulate any requirements mandated by the state or federal government, including, but not limited to, the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Nothing herein shall be interpreted as to prevent law enforcement officers with jurisdiction within the City of St. Augustine from exercising lawful authority to enforce any provisions of this chapter, consistent with the interlocal agreement. 
(b)  Violations of this chapter, unless another penalty is specifically provided within a section, are hereby declared to be civil infractions for which there may be imposed by the county court a maximum penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). In the event that an individual cited for violation of such sections shall not contest the citation, the penalty shall be twenty dollars ($20.00) for each offense. However, if the county enforcement officer elects to enforce the county animal code rather than this Code, as provided for in subsection (a), the penalty shall be as designated in the county animal code. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Manager or his or her designee from initiating code enforcement proceedings for a violation of this chapter, in accordance with chapter 2, article VI of the Code of the City of St. Augustine.

Sec. 6-1. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known and cited as the City of St. Augustine Archaeological Preservation Ordinance. 
(Code 1964, § 51/2-1) 
Sec. 6-2. - Findings. 
    It is the finding of the city commission that St. Augustine, as the oldest permanent European settlement within the United States of America, contains many areas that are historically and archaeologically important to the citizens of this city and the United States, from all periods of its history, including pre-Columbian Indian villages, the original Spanish settlements on the mainland and the Anastasia Island portion of the city, British settlements, fortifications and other settlements and developments from the Second Spanish period, the American Territorial period and the preCivil War period. Further, in the preservation and understanding of the historical importance of St. Augustine, there is generally a direct relationship of archaeology to the economic well-being of the city and the present and future needs, public health, safety, morals and general welfare of its citizens and its visitors. Further, there is an educational value and benefit to the city that would result from a viable program of archaeological activities and the preservation of related resources. 
(Code 1964, § 51/2-2) 
Sec. 6-3. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Archaeological site means a property or location which has yielded or may yield information on the city's history or prehistory. Archaeological sites may be found within archaeological zones, historic sites, historic districts, private properties, city properties and other areas of the city. Archaeological sites are evidenced by the presence of artifacts and features below the ground surface indicating the past use of a location by people. 
    Archaeological zone means a geographical area which has or may reasonably be expected to yield information on local history or prehistory based upon broad prehistoric or historic settlement patterns and existing archaeological knowledge. 
    Artifact means objects which are a product of human modification or objects which have been transported to a site by people. In this city, artifacts over fifty (50) years old are protected by this chapter. 
    City archaeologist means the individual with general responsibility for assessing the archaeological resources of the city and directing, conducting or coordinating the monitoring, testing or salvage archaeology excavations of these resources. The individual may either be a city employee, employed by the city manager, or may be an individual or corporation employed by the city on a contract basis. 
    Cultural or historic resource means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, object or other real or personal property of historical, architectural or archaeological value. The properties may include, but are not limited to, monuments, memorials, Indian habitations, ceremonial sites, abandoned settlements, sunken or abandoned ships, engineering works, treasure troves, artifacts or other objects with intrinsic historical or archaeological value, or any part thereof relating to the history, government and culture of the city, the state or the United States of America. 
    Delay period means the total number of calendar days (expressed in terms of weeks), such that the delay period is comprised of consecutive calendar days prior to commencement of a disturbance, plus the total number of calendar days subsequent to the commencement of a disturbance, during which testing or salvage archaeology efforts may be performed by the city archaeologist at an archaeology site, such that commencement or continuation of the disturbance and related construction work cannot otherwise proceed on the disturbance. 
    Disturbance means the cumulative digging, excavating, site preparation work or other such construction activities, regardless of the number of individual excavation or construction areas, related to an archaeological site. 
    Disturbance, major, means a disturbance that: 
(1)  Occurs at a non-single-family residential property. 
(2)  Occurs at locations more than three (3) inches below the adjacent surrounding ground surface. 
(3)  Encompasses a combined area of two hundred fifty (250) square feet or more. 
    Disturbance, minor, means a disturbance that: 
(1)  Occurs at a non-single-family residential property. 
(2)  Occurs at locations more than three (3) inches below the adjacent surrounding ground surface. 
(3)  Encompasses a combined area of less than two hundred fifty (250) square feet but equal to or greater than one hundred (100) square feet. 
In addition, the term "minor disturbance" shall be defined to mean a disturbance that occurs at a single-family residential property and occurs at locations three (3) inches or more below the surrounding ground surface and encompasses combined areas of one hundred (100) square feet or more. 
    Disturbance, unrelated, means a disturbance that: 
(1)  Occurs at locations from the ground surface to a maximum of three (3) inches below the adjacent surrounding ground surface. 
(2)  Encompasses a combined area of less than one hundred (100) square feet. 
(3)  Is not defined under "major disturbance" or "minor disturbance." 
    Land includes the word "marsh," "water" or "swamp." 
    Map means the archaeological base map of the city. 
    Monitoring means the observation after commencement of a disturbance to determine if archaeological resources exist in an area or, when such resources are known to exist, the observation, recording and incidental recovery of site features and materials to preserve a record of the affected portion of the site. Monitoring is applicable in locations where sites or features may occur but are generally not expected to be of such importance, size or complexity as to require lengthy work or project delays for salvage archaeology. 
    Project cost means either the estimated costs of construction, improvements or other related expenses, that are submitted by the applicant and used as the basis for calculation of prescribed building permit fees, or the estimated costs of construction, improvements or other related expenses, that are submitted by the applicant relative to a utility or right-of-way permit project, provided that the city, during its review of the archaeology application and the estimated costs, finds the proposed costs to be reasonably accurate. 
    Salvage archaeology means the archaeological excavation of a proposed disturbance (or a portion thereof) prior to its destruction by construction, or any other form of site disturbance. Salvage archaeology shall be concentrated only within the confines of the disturbance areas, in order to save site data which otherwise would be lost due to the disturbance. The extent of the salvage archaeology will be dependent on the proposed area of construction or disturbance, the estimated significance of the site and archaeological resources, the costs of the archaeology efforts and the availability of fees as hereinafter provided, the availability of general fund revenue budgeted for archaeology programs, time constraints, the degree of evidence of archaeological resources, and the recommendations of the city archaeologist relative to the need for the archaeology efforts. 
    Testing means the limited subsurface excavation or remote sensing of a proposed disturbance (or a portion thereof) to determine the potential, type or extent of the archaeological site. Testing may include augering and establishing archaeological excavation units and will include the screening of excavated material for artifact recovery. 
    Used or occupied includes the words "intended, designed or arranged to be used or occupied."

(Code 1964, § 51/2-5) 
Sec. 6-6. - Zone regulations. 
(a)  Within Archaeological Zones I, II or III, any proposed major or minor disturbance which requires a building permit, a city utility permit or a city right-of-way permit shall be subject to a review of the proposed disturbance, before such disturbance takes place, by the city based on an application form (archaeological review application) to be prescribed by the city manager. No building, right-of-way or utility permit will be issued by the city until the archaeology application has been submitted and the applicable archaeology fees have been paid. The archaeological review shall result in the determination of proposed archaeology efforts on the site and the application shall then be made a part of the city's prescribed permitting process. Only those disturbances that require a city building, utility or right-of-way permit will be governed by this chapter and, in addition, unrelated disturbances will not be applicable to this chapter. Furthermore, this chapter will apply only to the areas within the boundaries and confines of the proposed disturbances and any archaeology efforts shall be conducted so as not to cause any unnecessary damage to adjacent areas of the property. Any archaeology work proposed by the city concerning disturbances not relevant to this chapter may be conducted only based on written permission from the property owner to the city. 
(b)  Disturbances applicable to this chapter shall be in compliance with the following regulations: 
(1)  Within Archaeological Zone I, any major disturbance shall be subject to intensive salvage archaeology prior to the commencement of the disturbance, building construction, or utility excavation, by the city archaeologist.

(2)  Within Archaeological Zone II, any major disturbance shall be subject to testing prior to the commencement of the disturbance. If it is determined that there will be a significant archaeological impact from the proposed disturbance, or if the testing reveals that significant archaeological resources may exist, then salvage archaeology may also be conducted prior to commencement of the disturbance, as recommended by the city archaeologist and approved by the city. In addition, after the disturbance has commenced, it shall be subject to monitoring during construction to provide field data and to determine the presence of further or additional resources and, then, testing may again be conducted, as recommended by the city archaeologist and approved by the city. 
(3)  Within Archaeological Zone III, any major disturbance shall be subject to testing prior to the commencement of the disturbance. If it is determined that there will be a significant archaeological impact from the proposed disturbance, or if the testing reveals that significant archaeological resources exist, then salvage archaeology may also be conducted prior to commencement of the disturbance, as recommended by the city archaeologist and approved by the city. In addition, after the disturbance has commenced, it shall be subject only to monitoring during construction to provide additional field data. 
(4)  Within Archaeological Zone I, any minor disturbance shall be subject to testing prior to the commencement of the disturbance. If it is determined that there will be a significant archaeological impact from the proposed disturbance, or if the testing reveals that significant archaeological resources exist, then salvage archaeology may also be conducted prior to commencement of the disturbance, as recommended by the city archaeologist and approved by the city. In addition, after the disturbance has commenced, it shall be subject only to monitoring during construction to provide additional field data. 
(5)  Within Archaeological Zones II and III, minor disturbances shall be subject only to testing prior to commencement of the disturbance and only to monitoring after commencement of the disturbance by the city archaeologist.

Secs. 8-118-8-200. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - COASTAL CONSTRUCTION 
    The following requirements shall apply to construction within the city and shall be minimum standards for construction in this area. 

Sec. 8-201. - Definitions. 
    In construing this section, the definitions contained in Chapter 23 of the Code of the City of St. Augustine, and the following definitions shall apply: 
    Beach means the zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean low-water line to the place where there is marked change in material or physiographic form, or to the line of permanent vegetation, usually the effective limit of storm waves. "Beach" is alternatively termed "shore". 
    Coastal or shore protection structure means shore-hardening structures, such as seawalls, bulkheads, revetments, rubble mound structures, groins, breakwaters, and aggregates of materials other than beach sand used for shoreline protection; beach and dune restoration; and other structures which are intended to prevent erosion or protect other structures from wave and hydrodynamic forces. 
    Construction means the carrying out of any building, clearing, filling, excavation, or substantial improvement in the size or use of any structure or the appearance of any land. When appropriate to the context, "construction" refers to the act of construction or the result of construction. 
    Dune means a mound or ridge of loose sediments, usually sand-sized sediments, lying landward of the beach and deposited by any natural or artificial mechanism. 
    "Major structure" means houses, mobile homes, apartment buildings, condominiums, motels, hotels, restaurants, towers, other types of residential, commercial, or public buildings, and other construction having the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones. 
    Minor structure means pile-supported, elevated dune and beach walkover structures; beach access ramps and walkways; stairways; pile-supported, elevated viewing platforms, gazebos, and boardwalks; lifeguard support stands; public and private bathhouses; sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, handball courts, racquetball courts, and other uncovered paved areas; earth retaining walls; and sand fences, privacy fences, ornamental walls, ornamental garden structures, aviaries, and other ornamental construction. It shall be a characteristic of minor structures that they are considered to be expendable under design wind, wave, and storm forces. 
    Nonhabitable major structure means swimming pools; parking garages; pipelines; piers; canals, lakes, ditches, drainage structures, and other water retention structures; water and sewage treatment plants; electrical power plants, and all related structures or facilities, transmission lines, distribution lines, transformer pads, vaults, and substations; roads, bridges, streets, and highways; and underground storage tanks. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a structure, where the actual cost of the improvement or repair of the structure to its pre-damage condition equals or exceeds, over a five-year period, a cumulative total of fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
    The cumulative total cost does not include nonstructural interior finishings or roof coverings except when determining whether the structure has been substantially improved as a result of a single improvement or repair. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places. 
Sec. 8-202. - Construction requirements; major structures. 
(a)  In addition to conforming to the city building code, all major structures shall be designed, constructed, and located in compliance with National Flood Insurance Program regulations as found in 44 C.F.R. Parts 59 and 60, or the city floodplain management code, whichever is more restrictive. Major structures, except mobile homes, shall, at a minimum be designed and constructed in accordance with the city building code using a fastest mile-wind velocity of one hundred ten (110) miles per hour. Mobile homes shall conform to the Federal Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards or the Uniform Standards Code ANSI book A-119.1, pursuant to F.S. § 320.823. 
(b)  Foundation design and construction of a major structure shall consider all anticipated loads resulting from a 100-year storm event, including wave, hydrostatic, and hydrodynamic loads acting simultaneously with live and dead loads. Erosion computations for foundation design shall account for all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces, including localized scour due to the presence of structural components. Foundation design and construction shall provide for adequate bearing capacity taking into consideration the anticipated loss of soil above the design grade as a result of localized scour. The erosion computations required by this paragraph do not apply landward of coastal construction control lines established pursuant to F.S. Ch. 161, which have been established or updated since June 30, 1980. 
Sec. 8-203. - Construction requirements; minor structures. 
    Minor structures shall be designed, constructed, and located in compliance with National Flood Insurance Program regulations as found in 44 C.F.R. Parts 59 and 60, or the city floodplain management code, whichever is more restrictive, and the applicable provisions of the city building code.

Sec. 8-403. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for city participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.

Should grantor desire to invoke forfeiture of the franchise or imposition of liquidated damages as set forth herein, grantor shall make a written notice by certified or hand-delivered mail upon grantee's general manager at its local office to comply with any provision, rule or determination which it feels grantee has breached. If the breach by grantee is uncured for the period specified in section 9-13.2.1 in the case of forfeitures or ten (10) days in the case of liquidated damages, following such written demand, grantor may revoke the franchise or impose a liquidated damage, as appropriate. 
Should grantee dispute that a breach has occurred, grantee may request grantor to hold a hearing pursuant to section 9-13.3.2. Grantor may, at its option, suspend the time for cure until after final determination is made regarding whether a breach has, in fact, occurred, provided, however, that any liquidated damages or breach shall be deemed to run and be calculated from the date of grantor's original notice under this section in the event grantee shall fail in its effort to dispute that a breach has occurred. Any liquidated damages under this part shall be subject to judicial review at the request of grantee. 
9-13.3.2 Hearing. Should grantor desire to revoke the franchise or impose liquidated damages, and grantee requests a hearing under section 9-13.3.1 above, grantor shall provide grantee an opportunity to appear in a public hearing to present its argument, including the opportunity to offer evidence and question witnesses. Based on the evidence at such hearing, grantor shall determine and set forth in writing whether grantee was in breach of the chapter or franchise and, if so, if grantee has failed to cure or take substantial steps to cure such breach within the allotted time. Any liquidated damages under this part shall be subject to judicial review at the request of grantee. 
9-13.3.3 Computation of liquidated damage. Computation of liquidated damages shall begin on the day notice is received by grantee and shall continue until the breach is cured. 
    9-13.4 Force majeure; waiver of breach or liquidated damage. 
9-13.4.1 Force majeure. Grantee shall not be deemed in breach of this chapter or the franchise for any failure to perform which results from circumstances not under grantee's reasonable control, such as war, civil disturbance, strike, natural catastrophe, or acts of God. Grantee shall not be excused by economic hardship or by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers, employees, affiliates or parent. 
9-13.4.2 No waiver. Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligations to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or the franchise by reason of failure or delay of grantor to enforce prompt compliance. Any waiver by grantor of a breach or violation of any provision of this chapter or the franchise shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent or prior breach.

9-13.5.1 Removal.

Grantee's bond and indemnity shall remain in full force and effect during the entire term of removal. 
9-13.5.2 Disposal.

The cost of removal shall be recoverable from the letter of credit and bond provided for in the franchise and herein, and from grantee directly. 
9-13.5.3 Option to purchase. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, grantor shall have the option, upon revocation for cause of the franchise or in the event of non-renewal of an expired franchise, to purchase the cable system. If grantor elects to purchase the Cable System, the price shall be determined on the basis of a binding appraisal, rendered by a mutually-selected appraiser, in accordance with § 627 (47 USC 547) of the 1984 Cable Act, as amended. 
    9-13.6 Resolution of disputes. All disputes between grantor and grantee arising out of any franchise granted under this chapter or otherwise in effect at the time of its adoption shall be resolved in the following manner: 
9-13.6.1 Mediation. The parties shall first submit the issues in dispute to a mediator mutually agreed upon by them or appointed by the American Arbitration Association.

9-13.6.3 Remedies. In addition to any other remedy allowed at law or in equity, grantor shall be allowed recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses of prosecution of its claims or defense if grantor prevails on any one or more of the issues in dispute that are taken to litigation.

Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 11-28. - Issuance of building permits. 
(a)  The planning and zoning board shall review all applications for development in Conservation Overlay Zone 1; all applications for development in Conservation Overlay Zone 2, except as specified in subsection (b); and all applications for development in Conservation Overlay Zone 3, except as specified in subsection (c). Such approval by the planning and zoning board shall be after a public hearing as required by chapter 28. 
(b)  The planning and building division may issue permits for additions to existing structures, for construction of new secondary structures, such as fences, driveways, decks, patios, greenhouses, garages and sheds, and use permits for uses otherwise permitted to be conducted in these structures located in Conservation Overlay Zone 2 when no drainage into the marsh is proposed, no significant alteration of surface water hydrology will occur and native plant materials are preserved or replaced. The planning and building division may issue permits for the construction of new primary structures located in Conservation Overlay Zone 2 when the above conditions are met and when the subject property contains a seawall, bulkhead or rip rap shoreline, or is located within one hundred fifty (150) feet of existing development and the primary structure is located no closer to the marsh edge or to the mean high water line than are adjacent primary structures. In addition, such additions and new structures may not exceed the lesser of seventy-five (75) feet or seventy-five (75) percent of the lot width. 
(c)  The planning and building division may issue permits for structures and uses otherwise permitted and located within Conservation Overlay Zone 3 provided that all healthy significant trees are retained on the site. 
(d)  Removal of a significant tree shall be approved by the planning and zoning board. All significant trees removed shall be replaced in accordance with the requirements of chapter 25. 
(Code 1964, § 7-114; Ord. No. 96-02, § 1, 2-26-96; Ord. No. 09-17, § 1, 5-11-09; Ord. No. 19-03, § 1, 1-28-19) 
Sec. 11-29. - Standards for review. 
(a)  Permits for structures and uses located within Conservation Overlay Zone 1 shall be issued only for such structures and uses which have received permits under provisions of applicable federal and state regulations and will be issued only for those structures and related uses such as fishing piers and catwalks, boardwalks, boat docks, boathouses, boat ramps, marinas, and marine railways, as well as dredging and filling, which are determined to be to the benefit of the public as a whole and which are determined as having no significant negative impact on natural systems, by either individual or cumulative effect. The planning and zoning board is authorized to impose limitations in the nature and manner of construction and/or use so as to avoid damage to adjacent salt marshes and the vegetative communities contained therein, to eliminate any harm to the animal, fish or shellfish contained therein, to avoid blocking or disrupting vistas and scenic opportunities, and to enhance those vistas and scenic opportunities which are determined to benefit the public as a whole. 
(b)  Permits for structures and uses located within Conservation Overlay Zone 2 shall be issued only for those structures and related uses which are determined as having no significant negative impact on adjacent natural systems by either individual or cumulative effect. At no time shall the impervious area in Conservation Overlay Zone 2 exceed twenty-five (25) percent without that area receiving treatment equivalent to the St. Johns River Water Management District water quality treatment provisions required when new development is proposed along an unaltered shoreline. The first (landward of the most restrictive jurisdictional line) twenty-five (25) feet in Conservation Overlay Zone 2 shall remain undeveloped or, if the area is already disturbed, a restoration plan is required. The planning and zoning board is authorized to impose limitations in the following manner so as to avoid damage to adjacent salt marshes and the vegetative communities contained therein, to eliminate any harm to any animal, fish or shellfish life contained therein, to avoid blocking Conservation Overlay Zone 1 vistas and scenic opportunities, and to enhance those vistas and scenic opportunities which are determined to benefit the public as a whole. Rear or side lot drainage from grassed or altered areas of new development along an altered shoreline not directed to a water management system may be discharged to an adjacent water body/wetland; however, the area not treated must be compensated elsewhere in the system. This may be accomplished by providing additional water quality treatment in the system equivalent to that which will be discharged untreated. Water discharged shall be at non-erosive velocities. Rear or side lot drainage from grassed or altered areas of new development along an unaltered shoreline not directed to a water management system may be discharged to an adjacent water body/wetland through the twenty-five (25) feet buffer (water discharged shall be at non-erosive velocities), with the following permitted activities: 
(1)  Pruning vegetation to retain or create a reasonable view. Ground cover and shrub vegetation to a height of thirty-six (36) inches should be retained. 
(2)  A maximum of fifty (50) percent of the basal area of trees, and a maximum of fifty (50) percent of the total number of saplings, may be removed for any purpose in a twenty-year period. A healthy, well-distributed strand of trees, saplings, shrubs and ground covers and their living, undamaged root systems shall be left in place. Replacement planting with native, low maintenance vegetation is permitted to maintain the fifty (50) percent level. 
(3)  Dead, diseased, unsafe, or fallen trees may be removed. 
(4)  Reasonably sized bridges, paths, walkways, gazebos, docks and decks, and accessways to such amenities are permitted across the buffer provided such activities have minimal impact to the wetlands and are scaled to preserve the integrity of the buffer (less than ten (10) percent of the buffer). 
    Restoration plan(s) shall be developed to achieve the fifty (50) percent criteria above for those sites already disturbed. If the altered shoreline is bulk-headed, softening of this hardened shoreline with riprap, environmentally engineered materials or other techniques to soften wave energies and promote vegetation is encouraged. Should a softening effort be employed, a reduction in the twenty-five (25) feet buffer may be permitted. 
(c)  Applications for development in Conservation Overlay Zones shall be evaluated according to the following criteria: 
(1)  Site specific conditions. 
(2)  The site's relationship to adjacent properties, bodies of water and surrounding conservation zones. 
(3)  Natural and proposed drainage patterns. 
(4)  Effect of point and nonpoint discharge in the marine environment. 
(5)  Proposed soil stabilization and erosion control methods. 
(6)  Impact on floodplain. 
(7)  Impact of development on vegetative and animal communities. 
(8)  Potential for contaminated drainage, storage of pollutants and the use of poisonous chemicals and materials. 
(9)  Effect of shade on vegetation and shellfish. 
(10)  Effect of boat wake and boat traffic on manatees, vegetation, shellfish and wildlife, as well as shoreline erosion. 
(11)  Impact of development on shoreline by linear feet and percent of site. 
(12)  Impact of development on vistas and scenic opportunities by linear feet, height, mass and percent of site. 
(13)  Existing amounts of native plants and proposed retention and use of native plants for landscape and open space purposes. 
(14)  Impact of development on plant and animal habitat and potential loss in acres and percent of site. 
(15)  Impact of development on water quality. Water quality objectives will be presumed to have been met if runoff water is routed to a surface water management system permitted by the St. Johns River Water Management District or to a treatment facility that is equivalent to the water quality treatment criteria (water retention/detention) of the water management district. (An engineer or landscape architect licensed in the State of Florida is required to certify that the treatment facility is equivalent to the district's criteria.) 
(16)  Impact of development on shellfish and on commercial and sport fish and waterfowl. 
(17)  Specific conditions applicable to docks. In addition to the considerations listed in subsections (1) through (16) herein, no boathouse, roofed structure or wall shall be constructed on any dock. This section shall not prohibit the use of bumpers or similar structures built at or near the water line and below deck elevation to protect the dock from damage caused by moored vessels. The deck of any private boat dock shall not exceed six (6) feet in height above mean high water. Boatlifts mounted on docks, or constructed on or adjacent to a dock, shall be limited to a capacity of twelve thousand (12,000) pounds or less. All boatlifts shall be low profile boatlifts or no profile boatlifts, and no boats in excess of thirty-two (32) feet in length shall be allowed on a boatlift. In addition, the maximum height, excluding masts, antennas and other non-occupiable features, of a boat suspended in a boatlift shall not exceed six (6) feet above the gunwale (gunnel); whereby, the gunwale (gunnel) is defined as the upper edge of the side of the ship or boat. A low profile boatlift is a boatlift for a single watercraft in which no part of the boatlift shall exceed three (3) feet above the deck. A no profile boatlift is a boatlift for a single watercraft in which no part of the boatlift shall protrude above the deck. 
(d)  Permits for structures and uses located within Conservation Overlay Zone 3 shall be issued only for those structures and uses which do not significantly alter the surface water hydrology or tree canopy cover, or cause the removal of significant trees. The planning and zoning board is authorized to impose limitations on the nature and manner of construction and/or so as to avoid alteration of surface water hydrology which would increase the flood hazard potential and to minimize the impact on existing trees and native vegetation. 
(1)  In determining whether or not a permit required by this section should be issued, the city planning and zoning board shall consider and base all decisions on the following: 
a.  The condition of the tree with respect to disease, insect attack, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interferences with utility services. 
b.  The necessity of removing a tree to construct proposed improvements in order to allow reasonable economic use of the property. 
c.  The relief of the land where the tree is located and the effect removal of the tree would have on erosion, soil moisture retention, diversion, increased or decreased flow of surface waters and the city master drainage plan or similar plan adopted by the city commission. 
d.  The number and density of trees existing in the neighborhood on improved or unimproved property. The planning and building division shall also be guided by the effect removal of a tree would have on property values in the neighborhood where the property is located and on other vegetation in the neighborhood. 
e.  Whether the tree has been designated a significant tree. 
f.  Impact upon the urban and natural environment, including: 
1.  Ground and surface water stabilization. 
2.  Water quality and aquifer recharge. 
3.  Ecological impacts. 
4.  Noise pollution. 
5.  Air movement. 
6.  Air quality. 
7.  Wildlife habitat. 
g.  The ease with which the property owner or agent can alter or revise the proposed development or improvements to accommodate existing trees, including the tree or trees proposed to be removed. 
(e)  Issuance of permit. The planning and building division shall issue the removal permit for trees not identified as significant trees under section 11-27 unless, upon consideration of the criteria set forth above, it finds any of the following will result: 
(1)  That the property owner or agent will not be unreasonably affected in shifting the location of the proposed structure, building or improvement, which shift will maintain the existence of the subject trees and still permit construction of such building or improvement on the site. 
(2)  That the property owner or agent will not be unreasonably affected in modifying the design of the proposed structure, building or other improvement, which modification will maintain the existence of the trees proposed to be removed and still permit construction substantially similar to that originally proposed. 
(3)  That the removal of the subject trees will have a substantial adverse impact on the urban and natural environment. 
(4)  That the subject trees are significant trees and removal must be reviewed by the planning and zoning board.

ARTICLE IV. - NOISE CONTROL 

Sec. 11-86. - Scope. 
    The rules and regulations given in this article shall apply to the control of all sound originating within the geographical limits of the city. It shall be unlawful, except as expressly permitted in such sections, to make, cause or allow the making of any noise or sound which exceeds the limits set forth in section 11-88, table 1. 
(Code 1964, § 17-43) 
Sec. 11-87. - Terminology and standards. 
(a)  Terminology. All terminology used in this article not defined below shall be in conformance with applicable publications and standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or its successor body, the state and other applicable industry standards. 
(1)  "A" weighted sound level is the sound level as measured using the "A" weighting network with a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is Db(A). Sounds measured with the "A" weighting network approximate the response of human hearing when measuring sounds of low to moderate intensity. 
(2)  Ambient sound level means that measured value which represents the summation of the sound from all of the discrete sources affecting a given site at a given time, exclusive of extraneous sounds, and those from the source under investigation. Ambient sound level is often referred to as neighborhood residual sound level or background sound level. Ambient sounds are differentiated from extraneous sounds by the fact that the former are more steady state, although they may not be continuous. 
(3)  "C" weighted sound level is the sound level as measured using the "C" weighting network with a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is Db(C). The "C" weighting network is more sensitive to low frequencies than is the "A" weighting network. 
(4)  Classification of use occupancies. For the purpose of defining the "use occupancy," all premises containing habitually occupied sleeping quarters shall be considered in residential use. All premises containing transient commercial sleeping quarters shall be considered commercial use. All premises containing business where sales, professional or another commercial use is legally permitted shall be considered commercial use. All premises where manufacturing is legally permitted shall be considered manufacturing use. In case of a multiple use, the more restrictive use category shall prevail. Hospitals, nursing homes, schools, libraries and church uses shall be considered residential uses. Any area not otherwise classified shall conform to commercial standards. 
(5)  Continuous sound means any sound with a duration of more than one second, as measured with a sound level meter set to the "slow" meter response. 
(6)  Decibel (db) means a unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is twenty (20) micronewtons per square meter. 
(7)  Emergency work means any work performed for the purpose of preventing or alleviating physical trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an existing or imminent peril. 
(8)  Extraneous sound means a sound which is transient in nature and is neither part of the ambient sound, nor comes from the sound source under investigation. Examples of extraneous sounds include automobile horns and brakes, air transport vehicles, people shouting and dogs barking. 
(9)  Impulsive sound means either a single pressure peak or a single burst (multiple pressure peaks) that has a duration of less than one (1) second. Impulsive sounds are isolated events and are not peaks within an otherwise continuous sound. 
(10)  Noise control officer (NCO) means the city manager, or person(s) designated by the city manager. 
(11)  Noise sensitive means a facility whose operations may be detrimentally impacted by excessive sound levels. Such facilities include but are not limited to: 
a.  Schools; 
b.  Houses of worship; 
c.  Outpatient medical facilities. 
(12)  Person means any individual, association, partnership or corporation and includes any officer, employee, department, agency or instrumentality of the United States, the state or any political subdivision thereof. 
(13)  Plainly audible means any sound that can be detected by a person using his or her unaided hearing faculties. As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the detection of the rhythmic bass component of the music is sufficient to verify plainly audible sound. The noise control officer need not determine the title, specific words, or the artist performing the song. 
(14)  Sound level means the weighted sound pressure level obtained by the use of a sound level meter and frequency weighting network, such as A, B or C as specified in American National Standards Institute specifications for sound level meters (ANSI SI.4-1983, or the latest approved version thereof). If the frequency weighting employed is not indicated, the A-weighting shall apply. 
(15)  Sound level meter means an instrument that conforms to ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. 
(16)  Sound pressure level means twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the RMS sound pressure to the reference of twenty (20) micronewtons per square meter. 
(17)  Total sound level means that measured level which represents the summation of the sounds from the sound source under investigation and the ambient sounds which affect a given place at a given time, exclusive of extraneous sound sources. 
(b)  Measurement standards. Standards, instrumentation, personnel, measurement procedures, and reporting procedures to be used in the measurement of sound as provided for in this section shall be consistent with accepted and sound principles of noise measurement in accord with the standards of the American National Standards Institute or its successor body, the state or other applicable industry standards. 
(Code 1964, § 17-44; Ord. No. 00-16, § 1, 4-24-00) 
Sec. 11-88. - Maximum permissible sound. 
(a)  Continuous sound. 
(1)  No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any source of sound in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the sound level limits listed in table 1 when measured at or within the receiving property line. Sound pressure levels in excess of those established in table 1 shall constitute prima facie evidence that such sound is in violation of this Code.

(2)  These limits may not be exceeded by any single incident representing the normal, usual operation of the sound source, during any three sampling intervals, the duration of which shall be no less than one-half minute, within any one-hour period. 
(b)  Impulsive sound. 
(1)  Between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., impulsive sounds which occur less than ten (10) times in an hour shall not equal or exceed ten (10) decibels above the permissible sound level limits in table 1. Impulsive sound which repeats ten (10) or more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound level limits in table 1. 
(2)  Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., impulsive sounds which occur less than four (4) times in an hour shall not equal or exceed ten (10) decibels above the permissible sound level limits in table 1. Impulsive sound which repeats four (4) or more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound level limits in table 1. 
(c)  Steady pure tones. If the sound source under investigation is a mechanical device, and is in the investigating officer's opinion emitting a sound with a steady tonal quality, the permissible sound level limits in table 1 shall be reduced by five (5) dBA. The sound emissions must be comprised of a single frequency or a narrow cluster of frequencies, which may be referred to as a whine, hum or buzz. The measured sound levels of such a source must not fluctuate by more than plus or minus three (3) dB. Such sound sources include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating or air-conditioning units, refrigeration units and transformers. 
(d)  Fixed amplified sound reproduction devices. If the source of sound is an amplified sound reproduction device on private property, and the complainant states that the rhythmic bass component of the music is disturbing within their dwelling, then the noise enforcement officer may take sound level measurements within the dwelling of the complainant. No person shall cause, suffer, allow or permit the operation of any amplified source of sound in such a manner that it raises the total sound levels by the permissible sound level limits set forth in table 2 when measured within the residence of a complainant. These sound level measurements shall be conducted with the sound level meter set for "C" weighting, "fast" response. Such measurements shall not be taken in areas which receive only casual use, such as hallways, closets and bathrooms. For the purposes of these measurements, the ambient sound level is that sound level which is measured in the residence when the sound source under investigation is not prominent, or in a room on the same floor that is relatively unaffected by the sound source under investigation. The "C" scale is more sensitive to low frequency sound levels than the "A" scale; an increase of three (3) dB is perceived by humans as being plainly audible, an increase of five (5) dB is plainly louder, and an increase of ten (10) dB is perceived as being twice as loud.

(2)  Personal or commercial vehicular music amplification or reproduction equipment shall not be operated in such a manner that it is plainly audible at a distance of twenty-five (25) feet between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
(3)  Self-contained, portable, hand-held music or sound amplification or reproduction equipment shall not be operated on a public space or public right-of-way in such a manner as to be plainly audible at a distance of fifty (50) feet in any direction from the operator between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., sound from such equipment shall not be plainly audible by any person other than the operator. 
(Code 1964, § 17-45; Ord. No. 00-16, § 2, 4-24-00) 
Sec. 11-89. - Specific prohibitions against different types of noises. 
    In addition to the general prohibitions set out above and the maximum permissible sound levels set out in table 1, and unless otherwise exempted by this article or by act of the city, the following specific acts, or the causing or permitting thereof, are hereby declared to be in violation of such sections: 
(a)  Radios, television sets, musical instruments and similar devices. Operating, playing or permitting the operation or playing of any radio, television, phonograph, drum, musical instrument or similar device which produces or reproduces sound: 
1.  Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. in such a manner as to create excessive and unnecessary noise across a residential real property line or within a noise-sensitive area. 
2.  In such a manner as to exceed the levels set forth for the occupancy category set forth in table 1. 
(b)  Loudspeakers. Using or operating for any purpose any loudspeaker, loudspeaker system or similar device between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays and 10:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. on weekends and holidays in areas within or adjacent to residential, commercial or noise-sensitive areas, except for any noncommercial public speaking, public assembly or other activity for which a special permit has been issued by the city. 
(c)  Loudspeakers on beach. No loudspeaker or other sound-amplifying device shall be permitted, either temporarily or permanently, outside of any vehicle or building east of the line of mean high water at Ocean Way Beach. 
(d)  Street sales. Offering for sale, selling anything or advertising by shouting or outcry within any residential or commercial area or noise-sensitive zone of the city except by special permit issued by the city. 
(e)  Animals. Owning, possessing or harboring any animal or bird which, frequently or for continued duration, howls, barks, meows, squawks or makes other sounds which creates excessive and unnecessary noise across a residential or commercial real property line or within a noise-sensitive zone. These provisions shall not apply to public zoos or private animal attractions operated for profit to which the public has general admission and which are regulated by the city. For the purposes of this regulation, "barking dog" is defined as a dog that barks, bays, cries, howls or makes any other noise continuously and/or incessantly for a period of ten (10) minutes or barks intermittently for one-half (1/2) hour or more to the disturbance of any person at any time of day or night regardless of whether the dog is physically situated in or upon private property; however, a dog shall not be deemed a "barking dog" for the purposes of this regulation if, at the time the dog is barking or making any other noise, a person is trespassing or threatening to trespass upon private property in or upon which the dog is situated or for any other legitimate cause which teased or provoked the dog. 
(f)  Construction and demolition. Operating or causing the operation of any tools used in construction, drilling, repair, alteration or demolition work between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays, or between 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. on weekends or holidays in or within fifty (50) yards of any residential area or noise-sensitive zone, except for emergency work by public service utilities or by special permit approved by the city. This section shall not apply to the use of domestic power tools as specified in subsection (11).

Registration does not excuse a registrant from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(e)  Each communications services provider, communications facility provider or pass-through provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility, including without limitation, a collocation, in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the registrant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the registrant's primary contact person and the person to contact in case of emergency; 
(3)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; 
(4)  The number of the registrant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A registrant proposing to place or maintain a wireless communications facility operating on spectrum licensed by the FCC shall supply the file number of the FCC license authorizing such wireless service; and 
(5)  For a registrant that does not have a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the registrant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the state, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department of State. 
(f)  Registration application fees: No registration application fees shall be imposed for registration under this article. 
(g)  The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the city manager, or his or her designee. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (e) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (e) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness in writing. The city shall so reply to an application for registration within thirty (30) days after receipt of registration information. Non-effectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this article. An applicant has thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of non-effectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 13-8 hereof. 
(h)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities, including without limitation, collocations, in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(i)  Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by other ordinances, codes or regulations. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be amended or enacted from time to time. 
(j)  Registrant shall renew its registration with the city, annually, by the anniversary of the date of initial registration. Each renewal shall include an inventory of the communications facilities, poles, towers, underground lines and equipment cabinets registrant installed in public rights-of-way in the city during the last term of the registration and an inventory of the wireless communications facilities, poles, towers and equipment cabinets registrant abandoned in the public rights-of-way in the city during the last term of the registration. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the lapsed registrant has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(k)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit is required of a registrant that desires to place or maintain a communications facility, including without limitation, a collocation, in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition precedent to obtaining building or right-of-way permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, all permitting requirements of the city shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met.

(1)  Plans submittal. 
a.  For each proposed wireless or other communications facility location, submit plans prepared by, approved, and signed by a qualified professional engineer showing: 
i.  The location of the proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed; 
ii.  True-to-scale site plan depicting all physical improvement including property lines within a twenty-foot radius; 
iii.  A graphical depiction of each proposed communications facility to be installed. 
iv.  The size of each proposed communications facility; 
v.  The specifications for each communications facility; and 
vi.  Existing utilities in the immediate vicinity. 
b.  Plans shall be in hard copy format and an electronic format specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. 
c.  If the actual installation deviates or will deviate from the submitted plans due to unforeseen conditions or any other reason, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans. 
(2)  With respect to proposals to locate a new tower or replace an existing tower or wireless communication facility in the right-of-way, in addition to the requirements of sections 28-400 to 28-411, engineering documentation demonstrating either: 
a.  How the proposed tower or wireless communications facility can accommodate multiple collocations; 
b.  Why the city's interest in safe, aesthetic, efficient and effective management of the public rights-of-way is better served by the proposed tower or wireless communications facility than by a communications facility that could accommodate multiple collocations; or 
c.  Why a repurposed structure is not better suited to or feasible for the site; 
(3)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods or techniques); 
(4)  A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(5)  For purposes of assessing impact on right-of-way resources, effects on neighboring properties and potential for collocations or repurposed structures, information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, including information that identifies all above-ground and below ground structures (including light poles, power poles, equipment boxes and antenna), currently existing in the public rights-of-way in the city within a five hundred (500) feet radius of the proposed facility, if available (such information may be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other registrants with facilities in the public rights-of-way); 
(6)  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way; 
(7)  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the city which will be affected; 
(8)  Whether all or any portion of the proposed facilities will be rented, hired, leased, sublet, or licensed from or to any third party and, if so, the identity, and contact information of that third party; 
(9)  Prior to installation of any new or additional equipment in the rights-of-way, including, but not limited to, collocation at a specific site, the communications provider or pass-through provider shall be required to remove any and all unutilized or abandoned equipment. Any application to install new or additional equipment shall identify the abandoned or unutilized equipment that shall be removed prior to the installation of any new or additional technology or equipment in the rights-of-way; 
(10)  Such additional information as the city finds reasonably necessary with respect to the placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit application to review such permit application. 
(j)  New structures; availability of alternatives. No new utility pole, pole-type structure, or other freestanding structure shall be allowed in the rights-of-way unless the applicant demonstrates and staff and the city commission determines that no existing structure or alternative technology that does not require the placement of a new structure in a right-of-way can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or other communications facility. Such a demonstration by the applicant shall not give rise to a right to locate the proposed facility within the rights-of-way or in any way guarantee city approval of such. An applicant shall submit information requested by the city related to the availability of suitable existing structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed communications facility may consist of, but is not limited to, the following factors: 
(1)  No existing structures are located within the geographic area which would meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements, which shall be demonstrated by, at minimum, propagation and coverage maps. 
(3)  Existing structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna or other communications facility and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing structures, or the antenna on the existing structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing structure or to adapt an existing structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing structures unsuitable. 
(7)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of new structures, such as cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new structure or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(k)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way and may consider, among other things and without limitation, the sufficiency of space to accommodate all of the present communications facilities and pending applications to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, the sufficiency of space to accommodate city announced plans for public improvements or projects that the city determines are in the public interest, the impact on traffic and traffic safety, and the impact upon existing facilities in the rights-of-way. The city manager, or his or her designee, may impose additional reasonable rules and regulations to ensure the public health, safety and welfare, and peaceful enjoyment of city residents and businesses. 
(l)  All communications facilities shall be placed or maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. 
(m)  To the extent not prohibited by federal and state law, the city shall require any registrant that does not have communications facilities in the city as of the date of adoption of this article to place any new cables, wires, fiber optics, splice boxes and similar communications facilities underground, unless such communications facilities can be co-located on existing poles. The city manager, or his or her designee, may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
(n)  All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(o)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within thirty (30) days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended. For twelve (12) months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this article at its own expense. 
(p)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended from time to time. 
(q)  A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(r)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facilities in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(s)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the underground facility damage prevention and safety act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as it may be amended from time to time. 
(t)  Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(u)  Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(v)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including, but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(w)  The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of the city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate, modify, abandon or otherwise dispose of public rights-of-way, and the city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated, modified or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(x)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(y)  Upon completion of any communications facilities installation in public rights-of-way, the communications services provider shall furnish to the city, at no cost to the city, revised permitted drawings, if the actual installation deviated from those drawings, and, for any installations by directional bore, a copy of the directional bore logs showing depth. This requirement shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any filings the registrant is required to make under the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as amended from time to time. The fact that such plans or survey is on file with the city shall in no way abrogate the duty of any person to comply with the aforesaid Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act when performing work in the public rights-of-way. Any proprietary confidential business information obtained from a registrant in connection with a permit application or a permit, upon request of the registrant, shall be held confidential by the city to the extent provided in F.S. § 202.195, as amended from time to time. 
(z)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant, and the city also reserves the right to reserve any portion of the public rights-of-way for its own present or future use. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(aa)  The following additional objective design standards and other requirements apply when a registrant seeks authority to locate or collocate a wireless or other communications facility in the public rights-of-way. In addition to the requirements of sections 28-400 through 28-411, wireless and other communications facilities shall meet these additional reasonable location, context, color, stealth, and concealment requirements. Design standards may be waived by the city if it is determined that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a wireless facility or that the design standards impose excessive expense in relation to the aesthetic concerns of the city. The waiver shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request. 
(1)  Wireless facilities may increase the height of a metal street light pole only if the antenna is top-mounted and not wider than the pole or if the antenna is hidden in a cylinder that appears like an original part of the pole. A cellular antenna shall not extend more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the wireless facility is to be collocated, and shall be shorter if the height of the utility pole requires a shorter antenna height so that the structure as a whole is proportionate. 
(2)  A new utility pole that replaces an existing utility pole shall be of substantially similar design, material, and color as the existing utility pole. 
(3)  Antennas must be hidden within the utility pole or appear like an original part of the utility pole as designed by typical poles in the utility industry. 
(4)  Wires serving the wireless facilities must be concealed within or flush mounted to the pole on which the facilities are collocated and insulated in accordance with applicable codes. 
(5)  New or replacement poles that support wireless or communications facilities shall match the style, design, and color of the utility poles in the surrounding area and all requirements of the applicable codes as defined in the article. With priority given to the decorative pole types if there are more decorative poles in the surrounding area. 
(6)  The size and height of new wireless or communications facilities in the rights-of-way shall be no greater than the maximum size and height of any other utility or light poles located in the same portion of the right-of-way within the city other than a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade in place within five hundred (500) feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within five hundred (500) feet, the height of the utility pole shall be limited to fifty (50) feet, unless the city determines that a lower height is warranted given the location context for compatibility with existing or planned development within the vicinity of the proposed location or other provision of this article warrants such; provided however, that registrants proposing wireless or communications facilities with antennas to be located on existing poles or other structures may increase the height of the existing pole or other structure up to six (6) feet, if necessary, to avoid adversely affecting existing pole attachments; and provided further that the overall height above ground of any wireless or communications facility shall not exceed forty (40) feet or exceed the existing height of other utility or light poles located in the same portion of the right-of-way, whichever height is less. 
(7)  The city may charge an annual connection fee for each small wireless facility collocated upon a city utility pole in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). 
(8)  The city's action on proposals to place, construct or modify wireless communications facilities shall be subject to the standards and time frames set out in chapter 28, article V of the city's Land Development Regulations; F.S. § 377.401; F.S. § 365.172; and 47 USC § 1455(a), as they may be amended from time to time. 
(bb)  Make-ready for collocation. 
(1)  For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility shall provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The city shall not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the city. 
(2)  The city shall not require more make-ready work than is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. 
(3)  Fees for make-ready work shall not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, shall not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications service providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and shall not include any consultant fee or expense. 
(4)  Fees for make-ready work must be paid to the city, even if they exceed the applicant's estimate, before the wireless facilities may be operational. 
(cc)  Pursuant to F.S. § 337.401(3)(c)1.b., and other applicable provisions of law, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, the city hereby elects not to charge permit fees to any registrant for permits to do work in the public rights-of-way.

(1)  Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain workers of certain sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers. 
(4)  Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments. 
(6)  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, 253,448 through December 31, 1992 and currently there are 1,400,000 people infected with the disease nationally with 40,000 people becoming infected annually. 
(8)  As of December 31, 1995, there have been 51,838 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Florida with over 100,000 AIDS cases being reported in the State of Florida from 1983 - 2005 and Florida ranks third in cumulative AIDS cases in the United States and has the second highest AIDS rate in the United States. 
(9)  From 1981 to June 1996, the number of living persons testing positive for the HIV antibody with AIDS symptoms has risen to 73,217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements. 
(10)  The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990 and between 2004 and 2005, the national syphilis rate increased 11.1 per cent. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990 and currently 350,000 cases of gonorrhea are reported annually with Florida reporting over 20,000 cases of gonorrhea annually. 
(12)  The Surgeon General of the United States, in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view "adult" oriented films which gives rise to health and aesthetic concerns. 
(16)  The findings noted in paragraphs (1) through (15) above and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(17)  Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-oriented business and adult entertainment establishments, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually-oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter. 
(24)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central Florida where adult entertainment material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas. 
(25)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in Florida where adult entertainment and sexually-oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude, or topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(26)  Commercial sexually-oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in Florida where sexually-oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact, escort services and other services providing sexual encounters. The workers of such sexually-oriented businesses operating in Florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness. 
(27)  The activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order, health, safety, economy, property values, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit St. Augustine who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes. 
(28)  When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials and an unhealthy and unsanitary environment, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(29)  When the activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, discourage wholesome tourism, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(30)  Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that are incongruous with other business signage, lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(31)  The activities occurring at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment. 
(32)  Physical contact or touching within sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(33)  In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. 
(34)  The potential dangers to the good order, morals, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually-oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(35)  Requiring operators of sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments. 
(36)  Prohibiting sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses. 
(37)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between individuals and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
(38)  Workers at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including, but not limited to, a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of F.S. ch. 796, operation without business tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage. 
(39)  Physical contact or touching between workers of sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmittable diseases. 
(40)  The practice of not paying or underpaying workers at sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers. 
(41)  Sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and, therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community. 
(42)  Requiring sexually-oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur. 
(43)  The general welfare, health, good order, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. 
(c)  Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the good order, health, peace, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of St. Augustine. This chapter regulates conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by F.S. § 166.041. 
(d)  Authority. This chapter is enacted under the constitutionally derived home rule power of the City of St. Augustine in the interest of the good order, health, morals, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city. 
(e)  Recitals. It is the city commission's further intention to accomplish those intents and purposes expressed by the city commission in the recitals of the ordinance from which this section derives, each of which are incorporated by reference into this section. 
(f)  Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit constitutionally protected expression or speech. This chapter is intended to reasonably regulate the adult entertainment industry and sexually-oriented businesses which engage in commercial activities involving acts or services of a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or services involving matters which are sexual in nature. 
(Ord. No. 2007-10, § I(1), 7-9-07) 
Sec. 15-27. - Construction. 
(a)  This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose of reasonably regulating sexually-oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments in order to reduce or eliminate adverse secondary effects of such businesses and establishments.

Supp. 641 (M.D. Fla. 1994); affirmed, Cafe 207, Inc. v. St. Johns County, 66 F. 3d 272 (11th Cir. 1995); cert. denied, 134 L Ed. 2d.647 (U.S. April 22, 1996). This chapter shall not be construed to authorize any illegal act under federal law, state law or city ordinance. This chapter is intended to reasonably regulate such matters in order to reduce or eliminate the adverse secondary effects of commercial establishments and businesses. The regulation of alcoholic beverage establishments is also addressed in the City Code of the City of St. Augustine and other provisions of law. 
(b)  Unless otherwise indicated, all provisions of this chapter shall apply equally to all persons, regardless of sex. Masculine pronouns, such as "he," "his," and "him," as employed in this chapter, shall also be construed to apply to feminine pronouns and neutral pronouns, unless the context suggests otherwise.

Sec. 15-36. - Obscenity/indecent/exposure unlawful.

An escort who is a paid employee type worker of an escort service for whom taxes and social security payments are withheld and paid by the escort service, and who is not an independent contractor, is not required to obtain his or her own sexually-oriented business license for activities conducted pursuant to employment with the escort service.

An affirmative defense to an allegation that any person, business or establishment or entity is acting as an escort service is that it is a bona fide dating or matching service which arranges social matches or dates for two (2) persons who each wish to meet a compatible companion when neither of said persons solicits, accepts, or receives any financial gain or any monetary tip, consideration, or compensation for the meeting or date is not an escort service.

Further, a hearing officer shall not initiate or consider ex parte communications or other communications with any party of interest to a hearing officer concerning the substance of any proceeding to be heard by a hearing officer. However, the foregoing does not prohibit discussions between the hearing officer and city staff that pertain solely to scheduling and other administrative matters unrelated to the merits of the application.

Any party desiring to rebut the ex parte communication shall be entitled to do so but only if such party requests the opportunity for rebuttal within ten (10) days after notice of such communication. If he or she deems it necessary due to the effect of an ex parte communication received by him, the hearing officer may withdraw from the case and the city commission shall appoint another hearing officer to handle the case. 
e.  Selection of hearing officer. The city manager and licensee shall each have the right to eliminate one (1) of the three (3) hearing officers selected by the city commission.

(5)  The procedures used shall be those typically used in a civil case with the city manager or his/her designee having the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.

(10)  Each party to the hearing shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine opposing witnesses, impeach witnesses and rebut evidence. 
(11)  The licensee has the right, at his or her own expense, to be represented by an attorney at any hearing. 
(12)  All testimony before the hearing officer shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The licensee or the city may cause a verbatim record of the proceedings to be made. 
(13)  If the hearing officer comes to believe that any facts, claims, or allegations necessitate additional review or response by either the licensee or the city manager or his/her designee, then the hearing officer may order the hearing continued until an announced date certain, not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date of continuance. The hearing officer shall render a final decision on the appeal within sixty (60) days of the city manager's receipt of licensee's written notice of challenge. 
(14)  Hearing officers may allow the parties to submit written proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law following the hearing and shall advise the parties of the timetable for so doing, if allowed. 
(15)  At the conclusion of the hearing within the time prescribed herein, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth findings of fact, based on evidence of record, and issue conclusions of law regarding whether the suspension or revocation will become or remain effective, and shall render relief in the order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this section. 
(c)  Filing of decision. The original of the written decision of the hearing officer shall be filed with the city clerk and copies shall be delivered or mailed to the licensee, the city manager or his/her designee and the city police department. 
(d)  Judicial review. Any person who participated in a suspension or revocation hearing before the hearing officer and who is aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may immediately challenge the decision in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of procedure of that court.

Sec. 17-38. - Local communications services tax rate. 
(a)  Intent. 
(1)  It is the intent of the city commission of the city to increase its local communications services tax rate as provided in section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878 by the 2001 Florida Legislature. Section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878 provides that notwithstanding any provision of F.S. chapter 202, to the contrary, any municipality that has a local communications services tax conversion rate established under F.S. § 202.20, which is less than the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19, may by resolution or ordinance increase its rate up to the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19, with such increased rate to be effective October 1, 2001. For the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2002, the maximum rate established under F.S. § 202.19, is deemed to be the sum of such maximum rate plus the difference between the conversion rates set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of F.S. § 202.20(1). The municipality must notify the department of revenue of such increased rate by certified mail postmarked on or before July 16, 2001. 
(2)  It is the further intent of the city commission of the city to increase its local communications services tax rate effective October 1, 2002 as provided in F.S. § 202.19(2)(a), to the maximum tax rate of up to five and one-tenth (5.1) percent for municipalities that choose not to levy permit fees. 
(b)  Increased local communications services tax rate. 
(1)  The local communications services tax conversion rate established under F.S. § 202.20(1)(a), for the city is four and eight-tenths (4.8) percent, which is less than the maximum rate of five and four-tenths (5.4) percent as determined under the provisions of section 13, Enrolled CS/CS/SB 1878. The local communications services tax rate for the city is increased to five and four-tenths (5.4) percent during the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and ending September 30, 2002.

(Code 1964, § 30-2) 
Sec. 18-8. - Begging, panhandling and solicitation. 
(a)  Intent. The purpose and intent of this article is to recognize the constitutional right of persons to solicit, including but not limited to beg and panhandle, in a peaceful and non-threatening manner; however, an increase in aggressive panhandling and begging throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation, and disorder. Aggressive panhandling and begging usually includes approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive requests for donations of money despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language, unwanted physical contact, and the intentional, or as incident to the aggressive panhandling and begging, blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Additionally, the presence of panhandlers and beggars, who request money from persons in specific public areas such as outdoor cafes, automated teller machines, entrances and exits from buildings, and while standing in line to enter an event or a building, is especially troublesome because persons cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct, which often carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property as well as incidental to the panhandling and begging activities the imperiling of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of and visitors to St. Augustine by, among other things, blockage of ingress and egress from and into commercial businesses adjacent to public rights-of-way. 
This article is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to solicit, including but not limited to beg, panhandle or solicit funds, picket, protest, or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity, when conducted in a legal manner. The goal of this article is instead to ensure the foregoing constitutional rights while through regulation acting to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of panhandling and begging that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city by prohibiting aggressive panhandling and begging throughout the city and by regulating through time, place, and manner ordinance provisions regulating panhandling and begging in certain public places, based upon the foregoing significant important and substantial governmental interests set forth in the predicate clauses and an overriding compelling governmental interest to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of St. Augustine and visitors from the adverse secondary effects of solicitation, including panhandling and begging, in public areas. The restrictions contained in this article are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest, and preserve ample alternative areas for the valid exercise of constitutional rights of solicitation which they do as set forth more particularly herein. 
Further, even if such regulations were to be deemed to trigger strict scrutiny, the blockage of ingress and egress into and from commercial businesses and other public areas as well as the impedance of pedestrian walkways and other public rights-of-way implicates the compelling governmental interest of St. Augustine in protecting the health, safety and welfare of its citizenry and visitors in preserving police and fire department access to such rights-of-way in order to save lives. 
(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them as follows: 
(1)  After dark means from one-half hour after sunset until one-half hour before sunrise. The times of sunset and sunrise will be established by the times listed in any local publication of general distribution. 
(2)  Aggressive panhandling or begging means: 
a.  To approach or speak to a person and demand, request or beg for money or a donation of valuable property in such a manner as would cause a reasonable person to believe that the person is being threatened with imminent bodily injury or the commission of a criminal act upon the person approached or another person in the solicited person's company, or upon property in the person's immediate possession (for example, placing oneself within two feet of a solicited person and/or using abusive or profane language in a loud voice while demanding or requesting money); or 
b.  To maintain contact with a solicited person and continue demanding, requesting or begging for money or a donation of valuable property after the solicited person has made a negative response to an initial demand or request for money or a donation (for example, walking in front of, next to, or behind a solicited person while continuing to demand, request or beg for money from that person after that person has refused to donate or give money); or 
c.  To obstruct, block or impede, either individually or as part of a group of persons, the passage or free movement of a solicited person or a person in the company of a solicited person, including persons on foot, on bicycles, in wheelchairs or operating motor vehicles or persons attempting to enter or exit motor vehicles (for example, walking, standing, sitting, laying, or placing an object in such a manner as to block passage of another person or vehicle, or to require another person or driver of a vehicle to take evasive action to avoid physical contact); or 
d.  To touch or cause physical contact to a solicited person or a person in the company of a solicited person, or to touch any vehicle occupied by a solicited person or by a person in the company of the solicited person, without the person's express consent; or 
e.  To engage in conduct that would reasonably be construed as intended to intimidate, compel or force a solicited person to accede to demands. 
(3)  Panhandle or beg means any demand or request made in person for an immediate donation of money or some other article of value from another person for the use of one's self or others, including but not limited for a charitable or sponsor purpose or that will benefit a charitable organization or sponsor. As used in this article, the word "solicit" and its forms is included in this definition. A solicitation is considered as having taken place regardless of whether the person making the solicitation received any contribution.

(Code 1964, § 20-167; Ord. No. 89-66, § 2, 10-23-89; Ord. No. 02-05, § 2, 3-11-02)

(1)  To provide for the payment to each participant and nonretired former participant of an amount equal to his accumulated participant contributions; and

(4)  If any assets remain after satisfaction of all liabilities provided for in subsections (1), (2) and (3) above, any excess shall be delivered over and paid to the city. 
(b)  The above allocations may be implemented through the continuance of the existing trust, or through a new trust instrument for that purpose, or through the purchase by the board of insurance company contracts, or by a combination of these media. No participant or other employee shall have the rights or claims on the system or the city beyond the capacity of the assets held by the board to provide the benefits in accordance with the above provisions. 
(c)  If the allocations produce a retirement allowance of less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) a month for any person, the board may pay in lieu of such retirement allowance a lump sum of actuarial equivalent value. 
(Code 1964, § 20-168; Ord. No. 92-06, § 5, 3-23-92; Ord. No. 02-05, § 2, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 20-136. - Limitation on benefits. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1). 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 66-218, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-217. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to section 66-218, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-217. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000) limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures to defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 66-227 and 66-228, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
c.  For purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph c., and for purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)b., the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph c. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit- 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan. 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(3)  For purposes of applying the limits in this subsection (j), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a calendar year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the calendar year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the calendar year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee which the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c) -2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (j)(4)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution 
(k)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary. 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(Ord. No. 10-32, § 6, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-137. - Worker's compensation and unemployment benefits offset. 
    Should any terminated, disabled or retired participant receive either a worker's compensation wage loss benefit or an unemployment wage loss benefit for the same time period for which that person is entitled to a benefit under this retirement system, the amount of the retirement system benefit shall be reduced. The reduction in the retirement system benefit shall equal in the aggregate the total amount of the worker's compensation and unemployment wage loss benefits received by such person. 
(Code 1964, § 20-170; Ord. No. 02-05, § 2, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 20-138. - Correction of errors. 
    Should any change in the records result in any participant, retirant or beneficiary receiving from the retirement system more or less than he would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the board shall correct such error, and as far as practicable shall adjust the payment in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the participant, retirant or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(Code 1964, § 20-171; Ord. No. 02-05, § 2, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 20-139. - Subrogation.

Such supplement shall be paid under the same terms and conditions as the basic retirement allowance. A participant whose employment in grades 32 through 35 is involuntarily terminated without cause after the effective date of this plan shall receive the supplemental retirement allowance in accordance with this subsection for each year of credited service in such grades, regardless of the number of years of credited service earned after the effective date of this plan.

Sec. 20-146. - Rollover distributions and direct transfers. 
(a)  Election by distributee. This section applies to distributions made on or after the effective date of this ordinance. Notwithstanding any provision of this system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. 
(2)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this system, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal revenue Code that provides or accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse or domestic partner, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. 
(3)  Distributee: A distributee includes a participant or former participant. In addition, the participant's or former participant's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. 
(4)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

(1)  Transfers, direct rollovers or participant rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a participant contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code, which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible participant requested transfers from eligible retirement plans. 
(2)  Participant rollover contributions from 401(a) Plans and IRAs. The system will accept a participant rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from qualified plan described in section 401(a) of the Code, or from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code, that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in the participant's gross income.

No. 08-29, § 1, 1-12-09; Ord. No. 10-13, § 1, 4-26-10. 

Sec. 20-191. - Definitions. 
(1)  Terms defined. As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions with interest at the rate of three (3) percent per annum. For those members who purchase credited service at no cost to the system, only that portion of any payment representing the sum that he would have contributed had he been a member of the system for the years for which he is requesting credit, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means that any benefit payable under the terms of the system other than the normal form of benefit shall have the same actuarial present value as the normal form of payment on any single measurement date. The determination of the actuarial present value of any form of benefit, including lump sum distributions, shall be based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest discount rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation approved by the Board. This definition may be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board with the advice of the plan's actuary and the city's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject solely to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time City of St. Augustine Firefighter, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of St. Augustine, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the: 
(a)  Total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a firefighter with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a firefighter. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the fire department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the fire department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a firefighter with the fire department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a firefighter shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the firefighter repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment. 
(b)  The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "Qualified Military Service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L.103-353), after separation from employment as a firefighter with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
1.  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
2.  The member returns to his employment as a firefighter within one (1) year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
3.  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five (5) years. 
4.  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
(c)  For members who retire or terminate city employment on or after October 1, 2004, "creditable service" shall also include up to three (3) years of active duty in the U.S. armed forces or full-time employment as a firefighter with another governmental entity prior to employment by the city, purchased by the member in accordance with this paragraph; provided the member has not received and will not receive a benefit from another retirement plan based on such prior employment as a firefighter. Such purchased service may not be used for vesting purposes. An eligible member may purchase creditable service under the system for such prior employment by paying into the fund the full actuarial cost of such creditable service, as determined by the plan actuary. Such payment must be made in full prior to entering the DROP or separation from city employment, whichever occurs earlier. In the event full payment is not made prior to such date, the member shall receive only the amount of creditable service, as determined by the actuary, for which the payment made, excluding interest, is the full actuarial cost. A member purchasing such additional creditable service must also pay the full cost of any actuarial calculations required. Payment for the purchase of creditable service pursuant to this paragraph may be made using any one or a combination of the following options: 
(1)  Cash lump sum payment. 
(2)  Installment payments, plus simple interest at the rate of four (4) percent per annum, deducted from the member's city salary over a period not to exceed five (5) years. 
(3)  Direct transfer or rollover of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified or eligible plan, in accordance with section 20-214. 
    Effective date means October 1, 1993. 
    Firefighter means an actively employed full-time person employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a firefighter as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 633.408, and whose duty it is to extinguish fires, to protect life and to protect property. The term includes all certified, supervisory, and command personnel whose duties include, in whole or in part, the supervision, training, guidance, and management responsibilities of full-time firefighters, part-time firefighters, or auxiliary firefighters but does not include part-time firefighters or auxiliary firefighters. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed firefighter who fulfills the prescribed participation requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for in this article, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who enter the DROP, terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the twelve-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry in the deferred retirement option plan. 
    Salary means the total fixed compensation for services rendered to the city as a firefighter plus all tax deferred, tax exempt or tax sheltered items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions otherwise includible as fixed compensation. Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995.

Sec. 20-195. - Contributions. 
(1)  Member contributions. 
(a)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of five (5) percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period, but in any event, not more than five (5) days following the pay period. Effective upon adoption of this article, the contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(b)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(2)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for firefighters of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the city. 
(3)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system, determined in accordance with F.S. ch. 112, pt. VII, and applicable regulations. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded past service liability over a thirty-year period as provided in F.S. ch. 112, pt. VII. The required city contribution for any year shall be the total cost less employee contributions and less any applicable Chapter 175 premium tax revenues that may be used to reduce the required city contribution. Effective the beginning of the first full payroll period following September 22, 2008, the city shall guarantee a minimum contribution of three and one-half (3.5) percent of the salary of each member which shall be paid to the fund. 
(4)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-196. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(1)  Normal retirement date. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with, or next following the earlier of the attainment of age fifty-five (55), and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service or the attainment of age fifty-two (52) and the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service. For members who retire or terminate city employment on or after October 1, 2004, the normal retirement date shall also be the first day of the month coincident with, or next following the attainment of twenty-five (25) years of service, regardless of age. A member may retire on his normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter, and each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit on the member's normal retirement date. Normal retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal retirement date. 
(2)  Normal retirement benefit. 
(a)  A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement date and be continued thereafter during the member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal two and one-half (2.5) percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), above, the monthly retirement benefit for members who retire or terminate city employment on or after their normal retirement date and on or after October 1, 2004 shall equal two and one-half (2.5) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service prior to October 1, 2004, and two and three-fourths (2.75) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service after October 1, 2004; provided that members who are employed on October 1, 2004 shall receive a benefit equal to two and three-fourths (2.75) percent for each year of credited service prior to October 1, 2004 as follows: for each complete year of credited service attained after October 1, 2004, two years of credited service attained prior to October 1, 2004 will be credited at two and three-fourths (2.75) percent. In no event shall the total number of years of credited service credited at two and three-fourths (2.75) percent exceed the member's actual years of credited service or the maximum number of years of credited service, if any, allowed by this system, whichever is less. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the monthly retirement benefit for members who are employed by the city on or after January 1, 2008 shall be three (3) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service after that date. The "applicable frozen amount" of Chapter 175 premium tax revenues shall be increased to reflect the full actuarial cost of this benefit enhancement, after taking into account the one percent increase in member contributions provided in section 20-195(1). 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the monthly retirement benefit for members who are employed by the City on or after January 1, 2008 shall be upgraded to three (3) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service prior to that date, as follows: 
1.  Effective January 1, 2008, and each January 1 thereafter, the retirement benefit of all members with fifteen (15) or more years of credited service shall be upgraded annually, on an incremental basis, in accordance with this subparagraph, until all such members have a retirement benefit equal to three (3) percent of average final compensation for all years of credited service prior to that date. Each year the system actuary shall calculate the number of years of credited service that can be upgraded, with the earliest service upgraded first, to three (3) percent of average final compensation for those members with fifteen (15) or more years of credited service as of January 1 of that year, which can be funded at full actuarial cost by applying the total amount of any "excess state monies reserve" existing at that time, including the amount of Chapter 175 premium tax revenues received by the city during the preceding plan year in excess of the "applicable frozen amount" (after the adjustment in paragraph (c) above), if any. 
2.  After the retirement benefit of all members with fifteen (15) or more years of credited service has been upgraded to three (3) percent of average final compensation for all years of credited service in accordance with subparagraph (1) above, the retirement benefit of members with more than ten (10) but less than fifteen (15) years of credited service shall be upgraded to three (3) percent of average final compensation in the same manner as provided in subparagraph (1). In the event any member with more than ten (10) years of credited service attains fifteen years of credited service, such member's benefit shall be upgraded in accordance with subparagraph (1) above, before any further benefit upgrades are applied to members with less than fifteen (15) years of credited service in accordance with this subparagraph. 
3.  After the retirement benefit of all members with more than ten (10) but less than fifteen (15) years of credited service has been upgraded to three (3) percent of average final compensation for all years of credited service in accordance with subparagraph (2) above, all Chapter 175 premium tax revenues received by the city in excess of the "applicable frozen amount" shall be placed in the "excess state monies reserve," and used to upgrade the retirement benefit of members who attain ten (10) years of credited service in the future, in accordance with subparagraph (2), above. 
(3)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(4)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(a)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he remained a firefighter and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(b)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph (a) above reduced by three (3) percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the normal retirement date. 
(5)  Cost-of-living adjustment. The board of trustees is hereby authorized to grant periodic cost-of-living adjustments to benefits payable to all retired members during the continuation of benefits being payable under this plan; however, such adjustment shall not be made more frequently than on an annual basis. The conditions for granting such adjustments are as follows: 
(a)  The granting of same is actuarially sound and will not substantially affect the financial stability of the plan and will not require additional funding of the plan from any city funds from any source apart from funds received as tax levy proceeds authorized by F.S. § 175.101. 
(b)  The board shall formally approve the adjustments based on data contained in the current actuarial evaluation. 
(c)  The adjustment shall be divided into a "prefunded" component and an "ad hoc" component such that, once approved and for the purpose of the actuarial evaluations, the prefunded percentage increase will be assumed to be repeated on an annual basis for future years and the ad hoc increase will not be assumed to be repeated on an annual basis for future years. Future actuarial evaluations may determine that a modification to the assumed future prefunded increases will be necessary. 
(d)  Prefunded adjustments shall be based upon the monthly benefit being paid to a retirant on the month preceding the adjustment date. The average cost-of-living index, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor relative to the United States as a whole, shall be consideration for such adjustments. However, in no event shall the percentage for the prefunded component of the annual cost-of-living adjustment exceed two (2) percent for any annual adjustment date, nor shall any retiree's benefit be reduced below any benefit being received on October 1, 2001. 
(e)  The ad hoc component of the cost-of-living adjustment may be granted only when surplus funds are available within the plan and only if all other provisions of this section are satisfied. This portion of the adjustment shall be based upon the monthly benefit being paid to a retirant on the month preceding the adjustment date. The sum of the prefunded and ad hoc portions of the adjustment shall not exceed either three (3) percent or the average cost-of-living index as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, relative to the United States as a whole, whichever is the lesser amount. 
(6)  Ad-hoc cost-of-living adjustment. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2015, the monthly benefit being received by every eligible benefit recipient who was receiving benefits or entered the DROP on or before October 1, 2015, is increased as provided for in the following table. This is a one-time increase in these benefits. Beneficiaries and joint annuitants of deceased retirees shall receive adjustments as provided for herein based on the combined number of years of receipt of benefits of the deceased retiree and beneficiary or joint annuitant. 
Full number of years retired as of October 1, 2015 Monthly Benefit Increase 23 or more 25% ($100 minimum increase) 16-22 20% 5-15 1% for each full year in excess of 5 years Less than 5 No increase  
(7)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10; Ord. No. 17-04, § 2, 2-27-17) 
Sec. 20-197. - Pre-retirement death. 
(1)  Not-in-line death-Less than five years service. The beneficiary of a deceased member who dies from an injury or illness not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter and who has less than five (5) years credited service shall receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(2)  Deceased members with five years credited service or in-line death. 
(a)  The beneficiary of any actively employed member who dies and who, at the time of his death, had five (5) or more years of credited service or who, regardless of years of credited service, dies as a direct result of an illness or injury caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter, shall receive a monthly benefit which is the actuarial equivalent of that monthly amount which would have been payable had the deceased employee retired under normal retirement. 
(b)  A deceased member's pre-retirement death benefit shall be computed as provided in section 20-196, based on his average final compensation and credited service at the date of his death. However, if the deceased participant was under age sixty (60) on the date of his death, his credited service shall be increased to reflect the period between his date of death and the date he would have attained age sixty (60) years. 
(3)  Board determination. The board shall determine whether a member's death was in-line or not in-line of duty. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-198. - Disability. 
(1)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and one-half (2.5) percent, plus one-half (0.5) percent if under and until age sixty-five (65), of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be forty-two (42) percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he or she is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
(a)  Presumptions. Any condition or impairment of health of a firefighter caused by tuberculosis, hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such firefighter shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(b)  Additional presumption. F.S. § 112.181, as amended from time to time, is hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference and is applicable to conditions described therein that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
(3)  Disability benefits not-in line of duty. Any member with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and one-half (2.5) percent, plus one-half (0.5) percent if under and until age sixty-five (65), of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be twenty-five (25) percent of his average final compensation. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he or she is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(4)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(a)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(b)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrection or while committing a crime. 
(c)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(d)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the City of St. Augustine shall have terminated. 
(5)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that member had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(6)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(a)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(b)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
    Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 20-200, subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10; Ord. No. 17-04, § 3, 2-27-17) 
Sec. 20-199. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit which is actuarially equivalent to the deceased terminated member's accrued benefit commencing at his otherwise normal retirement date. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-200. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a retiree, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(a)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(b)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent, or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
(c)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(d)  For members who do not participate in the DROP pursuant to section 20-216, the member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
1.  Ten (10) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining ninety (90) percent paid under the normal form or as per (a),(b) or (c) above. 
2.  Fifteen (15) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty-five (85) percent paid under the normal form or as per subsection (a), (b) or (c) above. 
3.  Twenty (20) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty (80) percent paid under the normal form or as per subsection (a),(b) or (c) above. 
4.  Twenty-five (25) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining seventy-five (75) percent paid under the normal form or as per subsection (a), (b) or (c) above. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (1)(b) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(3)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner, and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 20-201. 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 20-197. 
(b)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(c)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 20-201.

(e)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(6)  A member may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

(1)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(2)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (1), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum.

(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-205. - Maximum pension. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(a)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(b)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half (5.5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code), divided by 1.05. 
(c)  The actuary may adjust the Section 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) above. 
(3)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(a)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(b)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(c)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
(a)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(b)  thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(c)  in no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(a)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(b)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (5)(a) above shall not apply. 
(c)  The reductions provided for in subsection (5)(a) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 20-198, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 20-197. 
(d)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 20-198, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 20-197. 
(7)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000) limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 20-205, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (8) of section 20-205 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the City has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the City, the limit under this subsection (8) of section 20-205 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(9)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(a)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in section 20-191, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (10)(a)1., the System will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph , and for purposes of applying subparagraph (10)(a)2. the System will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(b)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
1.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (10)(b)2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(11)  Contribution limits. 
(a)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
a.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
b.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under the definition of salary in section 20-191, definitions. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (11)(b)1. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(c)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(d)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (11) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(12)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(a)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(b)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10; Ord. No. 13-29, § 2, 11-20-13; Ord. No. 17-04, § 4, 2-27-17) 
Sec. 20-206. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(1)  General rules. 
(a)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d).

(2)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(a)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(b)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (2)(b), other than subsection (2)(b)1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (2)(b), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (2)(b)4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)(b)1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)(b)1.), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(c)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(d)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year.

1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
2.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 20-196, section 20-197, section 20-199, or section 20-200 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(b)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 20-197) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g. monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(c)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(4)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(5)  Prohibited transactions. Effective as of January 1, 1989, a board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by Code Section 503(b). 
(6)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(7)  Vesting. 
(a)  Member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(b)  A member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(8)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)-21. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-208. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(1)  The article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, permanent discontinuance of contributions, or plan termination because of a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(3)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(a)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(b)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c). 
(c)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (b) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the firefighter. 
(d)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(e)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (b), the amounts determined under subsection (c). 
    If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

(a)  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the system's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a retiree, the member or retiree shall submit the proposed order to the board for review to determine whether the system may legally honor the order. 
(b)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(2)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. ch. 175 and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(3)  Exemption from execution, non-assignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this article and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this article are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

(2)  Conviction shall be defined as an adjudication of guilt by a court of competent jurisdiction; a plea of guilty or a nolo contendere; a jury verdict of guilty when adjudication of guilt is withheld and the accused is placed on probation; or a conviction by the Senate of an impeachable offense. 
(3)  Court shall be defined as any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction which is exercising its jurisdiction to consider a proceeding involving the alleged commission of a specified offense.

The board may implement all legal action necessary to recover such funds. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-212. - Conviction and forfeiture; false, misleading or fraudulent statements.

(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-214. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distributions. 
(a)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(b)  Definitions. 
1.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
2.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
3.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
4.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(2)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(a)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(b)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(3)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-215. - Reserved. 
Sec. 20-216. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(1)  A deferred retirement option plan ("DROP") is hereby established for eligible firefighters, effective retroactively to January 1, 2005. 
(2)  Eligibility and participation: 
(a)  A firefighter who is actively employed by the city and reaches the normal retirement date shall be eligible to participate in the DROP. 
(b)  A member's election to participate in the DROP shall be irrevocable. 
(c)  An eligible member may participate in the DROP for a maximum of sixty (60) months from the date the DROP plan takes effect, if the member has reached his or her earliest normal retirement date prior to that time; or if the member has not reached his or her earliest normal retirement date at the time the DROP plan takes effect, for a maximum of sixty (60) months from the date the member reaches his or her earliest normal retirement date. An eligible member may elect to participate in the DROP with thirty (30) days advance written notice to the city. An eligible member may defer entry into DROP beyond the date the member is first eligible to enter the DROP. If a member defers entry into the DROP, the maximum DROP period will be reduced one (1) month for each month of deferred entry. In no event will the maximum DROP period be extended beyond sixty (60) months from the date the member is first eligible to participate. Example: A member is eligible to participate in DROP for a maximum sixty (60) months from the date the member is first eligible to participate; however, if the member defers entry into the DROP for twelve (12) months after reaching the earliest normal retirement age (or if the member has already reached the earliest normal retirement age at the time the DROP takes effect, twelve (12) months after that date), the member will be able to participate in the DROP for a maximum of forty-eight (48) months. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, any member who completes twenty-five (25) years of service before age fifty-two (52) may defer entry into DROP until age 52, with no reduction in the DROP period. A member who elects to participate in the DROP can elect to terminate DROP participation and city employment sooner than the maximum DROP period, with thirty (30) days advance written notice to the city. 
(3)  DROP plan features: 
(a)  An eligible member who elects to participate in the DROP will be considered to have retired for purposes of the pension plan. The member's monthly retirement benefit, determined in accordance with the plan based on years of creditable service and average final compensation at the time the member enters the DROP, will be paid into his or her DROP account every month during the DROP period. No member or city contributions shall be required after a member enters the DROP, and the member will not accrue any additional creditable service or any additional benefits under the pension plan after entering the DROP except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP Participants. 
(b)  A member who elects to participate in the DROP shall not be eligible for disability or preretirement death benefits under the pension plan. 
(c)  As a condition of participating in the DROP, the member must agree to resign from city employment at the conclusion of the DROP period and must submit an irrevocable letter of resignation prior to entering the DROP. 
(d)  Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment, and DROP participants will be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(e)  The member's DROP account will earn interest at an annual rate of six and one-half percent (6.5%) compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants). 
(f)  Within thirty (30) days following a DROP participant's termination of city employment or death, the member's entire DROP account balance shall be distributed to the member [or in the event of the member's death, to the member's designated beneficiary or estate in accordance with paragraph (g) below] in a cash lump sum, unless the member elects to have all or any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the member in a direct rollover. Any such direct rollover will be accomplished in accordance with section 20-214. 
(g)  If a DROP participant dies before his or her DROP account is distributed, the participant's designated beneficiary shall have the same rights as the participant with respect to the distribution of the DROP account. If the member has not designated a beneficiary, the DROP account balance shall be paid to the member's estate. 
(h)  The pension board shall adopt any necessary rules for administering the "DROP." 
(4)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 20-216 for the remainder of his or her employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(5)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(6)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(7)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10; Ord. No. 17-04, § 6, 2-27-17) 
Sec. 20-217. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(1)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(2)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a firefighter and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(3)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a firefighter, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. 
(4)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (2) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(5)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(6)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 10-34, § 1, 10-11-10) 
Sec. 20-218. - Prior fire service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in section 20-191, the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a full-time firefighter with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a full-time firefighter for any other municipal, county, state or special district fire department in the State of Florida shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the firefighter of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section for service other than with the city of shall be three (3) years of credited service and shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the City of St. Augustine and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal, county or special district fire department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in section 20-205(12)(b). 
(6)  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a firefighter as provided for in this section, in addition to service as a firefighter in this state, credit may be purchased by the member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the division of state fire marshal, as provided under F.S. ch. 633, or the firefighter provides proof to the board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a firefighter under section 20-191.

    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefit to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous sections of this Plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. ch. 175, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 175.351. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("Share Plan") shall be further allocated to the members and DROP participants in a manner to be agreed upon.

    Developer means any person engaged in developing or subdividing land under the terms of this Code. The term "developer" is intended to include the term "subdivider," even though the person involved in successive stages of a development project may vary. 
    Development order means the approval action for a development and shall include: 
(1)  Final development order means the final approval action for a development, including a building permit, or where such action is not required for final approval, a final subdivision plan, a final development plan for a planned unit development (PUD), final construction plans for a site and development plan, or a use permit/certificate of occupancy not linked to a building permit. 
(2)  Preliminary development order means approval action required before a final development order may be considered and includes preliminary subdivision plans, approved ordinances creating planned unit developments (PUD's), exceptions, variances, conservation overlay zone development, rezonings, land use plan amendments, certificates or opinion of appropriateness, site plan approval, use permit applications without a certificate of occupancy, building plan approval, utility availability letter and storm drainage approval. Applications for concurrency determination will be required for certain preliminary development orders, including rezonings, land use plan amendments, exceptions, variances, preliminary development plans for a PUD, preliminary plats for a subdivision and any development requiring special review by the planning and zoning board as outlined in chapter 28. 
    Final subdivision plan includes the plat to be recorded, final engineering plans, specifications and calculations; certification of improvements, as-built drawings, or performance guarantee; and other required certifications, bonds, agreements, approvals and materials for a development phase or the entirety of a parcel of land meeting the requirements of this Code.

    Major intersection means the junction of two (2) functionally classified roadways. 
    Mini parkland means parkland that serves smaller neighborhood areas. These parks are usually vacant lots converted to recreation use for residents of the immediate area. 
    Neighborhood parkland means parkland which serves the population of a neighborhood and which is generally accessible by bicycle or pedestrian ways (including mini parks). 
    Platted lot of record means: 
(1)  A lot which is part of a subdivision or planned unit development which has been recorded in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county prior to October 1, 1991; or 
(2)  A lot or parcel described by metes and bounds, the description of which has been so recorded on or before October 1, 1991. 
    Preliminary subdivision plan means the site plan; tree location map or aerial photographic overlay; preliminary engineering plans, specifications and calculations; and other necessary materials for a development phase or the entirety of a parcel of land, meeting the requirements of this Code.

a.  That the applicant has made such a substantial change of position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses, acting in good faith and in reasonable reliance on a valid, unexpired act or omission of the city; 
b.  That it would be highly inequitable or unjust to affect such rights by requiring the applicant to conform to the requirements of this article. 
If the applicant is determined to have acquired vested rights, or if the city is determined to be equitably estopped from applying the requirements of this article to such project, the applicant shall be granted a concurrency exemption determination; 
(7)  Upon determination of prior approval, subject to the following conditions: 
a.  Concurrency exemption determination may be granted, absent a determination of vested rights and/or equitable estoppel, if the applicant demonstrates: 
1.  That prior development approvals granted by the city were subject to a thorough analysis of the impacts of the proposed project on the applicable public facilities; and 
2.  That public facilities and conditions have not changed substantially since the issuance of the prior development approvals, or that the impacts on applicable public facilities have been specifically addressed in the comprehensive plan and the five-year capital improvements program or that prior development approvals have been expressly conditioned upon assuring concurrency; and 
3.  That such conditions make it unnecessary or unreasonable to apply the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 91-23, § 11, 9-23-91) 
Sec. 21-30. - Same-Applications. 
    Applications for determination of exemption pursuant to section 21-29 shall be filed with the director of the planning and building department. Determinations thereon may be made by the director of the planning and building department and the director of the public works department.

(Ord. No. 91-23, § 12, 9-23-91) 
Sec. 21-31. - Same-Modification of projects. 
    A project exempt from concurrency management may be modified, regardless of whether the modifications are substantial deviations, as long as the modification does not increase the impacts of the project on adopted levels of service, or alter the location and timing of those impacts in a way that would result in the projected operating levels of service being reduced below the projected operating level of service without the modification, or in any way that would impact on any facility that was not previously impacted. 
(Ord. No. 91-23, § 13, 9-23-91) 
Sec. 21-32. - Same-Effect of determinations. 
    Issuance of a concurrency exemption determination shall relieve the applicant from being subject to the provisions of this article; provided, however, that the proposed project shall be subject to all governmental requirements relating to availability and adequacy of public facilities which were in effect prior to October 1, 1991. A concurrency exemption determination shall have no effect on other applicable governmental requirements.

Sec. 21-34. - Applications for development orders. 
    Development orders shall be filed with the planning and building department which shall be responsible for coordination with other departments of the city for evaluation of the adequacy of existing and planned facilities. The public works department shall evaluate drainage, potable water, sanitary sewer and solid waste levels of service. The planning and building department shall evaluate parkland levels of service and shall in conjunction with the public works department, evaluate roadway levels of service. Concurrency determinations will be required for all developments before a final development order is issued, except those specifically exempt from the requirements of this article. As to developments which require phasing, a concurrency determination application will be required for the entire project; provided, however, that concurrency may be reserved only for each phase of development with reservation of future concurrency only upon substantial completion of prior phases. Applications for concurrency determination will be required for certain preliminary development orders, including rezonings, land use plan amendments, exceptions, variances, preliminary development plans for a PUD, preliminary plats for a subdivision, and any development requiring special review by the planning and zoning board as outlined in chapter 28. However, concurrency will not be reserved, and therefore, a final development order will not be issued, until all required utility fees are paid, or if utility fees are not applicable, when required building permit fees are paid.

7.  Furnish a certificate of insurance or self-insurance. 
8.

f.  Bond. A performance bond, or other financial security, in form, content and execution approved by the city attorney, may be required to ensure financial responsibility for completion of specified work not completed or for repair of damages to the right-of-way or any public property occurring and not repaired in accord with good engineering practices or for events where the work is nonconforming as determined by the public works department. In addition to paying the permit and inspection fees established by resolution of the city commission, a performance bond or other security approved by the city attorney shall be in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a nonrefundable processing fee plus two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) as a retainer refundable within thirty (30) days after completion of specified work. If the work in question exceeds a value of two thousand dollars ($2,000), the bond amount shall be increased by the difference between two thousand dollars ($2,000) and the increased value of the work plus ten (10) percent of that difference. In the alternative, the performance bond may be in the form of a blanket bond approved by the city attorney in form, content and execution and which satisfies the financial protection requirements of this section. If said work remains incomplete after thirty (30) days, the bond will be forfeited. Such forms shall prescribe the manner in which noncompliance with the provisions of a permit or this subchapter shall be remedied and shall provide the necessary financial assurances to remedy any noncompliance.

(5)  The permit granted by the city to the utility shall not be transferable to another without the city's prior approval. No such sale or transfer shall be effective until the vendee, assignee or lessee has filed with the city an instrument, duly executed, reciting the fact of such sale, assignment or lease; accepting the terms of the permit; and agreeing to perform all the conditions thereof. The city will not unreasonably withhold its consent to the transfer of the permit. 
(6)  Any violation by the utility, its vendee, lessee or successor to the provisions of any permit issued hereunder or any material portions thereof shall be cause for the forfeiture of the permit and all rights thereunder if such violation, failure or default without agreement of the city continues for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice by the city to the utility thereof. 
(7)  The utility shall, at all times during the life of any permit issued pursuant to this section, be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power by the city and such reasonable regulations as the city shall hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide. The rights and privileges granted to the utility pursuant to any such permit shall at all times be subordinate and inferior to the rights of the public in and to the ordinary use of the city streets and rights-of-way and nothing in any permit shall be construed as a surrender by the city of its right and power to use and regulate the use of its streets and rights-of-way. The utility shall obtain the permit provided for in this section before commencing any work requiring a permit and shall obtain such other permits as may be required and shall provide for the following:

Should the utility fail to commence restoration after seven (7) days' notice, in writing, to such utility by the city, the city may make such repair and restoration and the cost of the same shall be paid by the utility. In the event the utility shall fail to pay for such repair and restoration, no additional permit will be issued while the utility is in default thereof. 
c.  If at any time during the period of any such permit, the city shall lawfully elect to alter, or change the grade of, any street, sidewalk, driveway, alley or other public way, or alter or move any structural facility of the city, the utility, upon reasonable notice by the city, shall remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cable, underground conduits, water or sewer lines, manholes or other fixtures at its own expense. 
d.  The utility shall not place poles or other fixtures where the same will interfere with any gas lamp, electric light, water hydrant, water main, or sewage line and all such poles and other fixtures placed in the streets shall be placed at the outer edge of the sidewalk and inside the curbline (or such other place designated by the city) and those placed in alleys shall be placed close to the line of the lot abutting on such alley, and in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on such streets, alleys and public ways. 
e.  Utilities shall, on the request of any person holding a building permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower their wires to permit the moving of buildings.

The utility shall be given notice not less than forty-eight (48) hours to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
f.  As a further condition of the issuance of any permit the utility shall agree to provide the city with records of its underground installation, as built, on sheets provided by the utility within sixty (60) days of the completion of the installation. 
(8)  The permit shall be issued upon the express understanding and agreement by the utility that the utility shall save the city harmless for loss sustained by the city on account of any suit, judgement, execution, claim or demand whatsoever, resulting from the negligence, default or misconduct on the part of the utility, its agents, servants, employees or independent contractors, in the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities in the area of the permit issued. 
(d)  This section shall not effect or invalidate any valid franchise right of any public service company having an existing franchise with the city. 
(e)  The issuance of a permit pursuant to this section shall not authorize or permit distribution facilities for a utility in competition or providing essentially the same service as that provided by a public service company regulated by the state public service commission which has a valid franchise agreement with the city, it being understood and it being the intent of this section that the operation of a competing system shall require the issuance of a franchise agreement upon the same terms and conditions and under such circumstances as deemed advisable by the city as required for the public service company having a valid franchise agreement with the city.

    Subdivider means any person who undertakes the subdivision of land. 
    Subdivision means the division of real property in the city into two (2) or more contiguous lots, parcels, tracts, tiers, blocks, sites, units or any other division of land, designated by reference to the number or symbol of the lot, parcel or such units contained in the plat or drawing of such subdivision for the purpose whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership, or if the establishment of a new street is involved, any division of such parcel. The work includes establishment of new rights-of-way and alleys and additions when they result in the division of real property. When appropriate to the context, the word also includes resubdivision and relates to the process of subdividing or to lands or areas subdivided. This shall not apply to gifts or devises within a family unit nor to any approved PUD subdivision as defined in the city's zoning ordinance. The following shall be exempt and not subject to the regulations prescribed by this chapter: 
(1)  The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots in the previously recorded plat is not increased and the resultant lots comply with the standards of this chapter and the zoning code.

(3)  The public acquisition by purchase, acceptance of deed of dedication; or exercise of the right of eminent domain of strips of land for the widening or opening of streets. 
    The word "subdivision" shall and does include the division of real property contained in existing platted lots, regardless of whether or not such division creates less than two (2) additional lots, when the effect of such division is to increase the total number of lots or parcels in the previously recorded plat, or, when the effect is to add, delete, establish, create, change or alter street lines or public or private easements of whatsoever kind within the boundaries of the previously recorded plat. The word subdivision shall not include the vacation of roads pursuant to F.S. § 336.10. 
    The word "subdivision" shall not apply to the division of real property contained in an existing platted lot that is part of a subdivision that was recorded prior to the effective date of the legislation from which this chapter is derived, provided that: 
(1)  No parcel, lot or portion will be created whose lot area is less than one (1) acre. 
(2)  The lots as divided meet the standards set by the city's zoning ordinance. 
(3)  No previously existing lot line is moved, altered or changed.

This limited exemption shall not effect or alter the zoning ordinances that pertain to the subject property. 
    Title certification means every plat of a subdivision submitted to the city commission must be accompanied by a title opinion of an attorney at law, licensed in the state, or a title insurance company policy confirming that the lands as described and shown on the plat are titled in the name of the person executing the dedication as it is shown on the plat and that the developer has title to the lands. The title opinion or policy shall also show all liens, mortgages and other encumbrances on the land to be platted. 
    Transfer or sale means the change in ownership of either legal title, an equitable interest, or the beneficial interest, of a lot or parcel within a subdivision and includes but is not limited to contracts for sale and agreements for deeds; provided, however, it shall not include any contract for sale that specifically provides in bold print that the sale is contingent upon the recordation of a subdivision plat pursuant to this chapter.

Sec. 24-92. - Creation of "controlled parking residential area". 
(a)  A residentially zoned area shall be deemed eligible for designation as a "controlled parking residential area" for residential permit parking if parking there is impacted by commuter vehicles and off-street parking is limited. 
(b)  The following objective criteria are established to be used in evaluating the need for restricted parking in a residentially zoned area/street in accordance with this division. For an area/street to be eligible for residential permit parking, that area must meet the following criteria: 
(1)  During peak periods, the number of vehicles parked or standing, legally or illegally, on streets in the area is equal to fifty (50) percent or more of the on-street parking capacity of the area. For purposes of this criterion, a legal parking space shall be twenty (20) linear feet measured parallel to the curb or pavement edge; and

In addition, the city manager shall cause parking signs to be erected upon public streets in the area, indicating the times, locations, and conditions upon which parking shall be by permit only. When an area has been approved, designated and posted as a "controlled parking residential area", it shall be unlawful and a violation of this ordinance to park a commuter vehicle in an area restricted to permit parking only without having a valid residential parking permit affixed on the left rear window or bumper of the vehicle or license plate registered with the city.

The permittee shall apply in person for the initial permit and shall present all required documentation. Personal appearance shall not be required for permit renewals with the same information required each year prior to expiration of the permit. Permits will be available as of December 20th of each year. 
(d)  The permit must be displayed on the lower left corner of the outside rear window or on the left rear bumper of the vehicle or the license plate may be registered with the city. For the permit to be valid it must be displayed as such on the vehicle listed on the completed application. Permits not displayed properly or on a vehicle other than listed will be null and void. 
(e)  Guest/Service permits. Upon application by such owner, up to two (2) guest/service permits may be issued and used by such owner for the sole purpose of providing parking on a temporary basis to service vehicles which are conducting work at such owner's premises or for guests of such owner's residence. The permits shall be used only for the period during which business is to be conducted by the service vehicles or for the duration of stay of a guest to the residence for which the permit is issued. The application for a guest/service permit or permits shall be completed by such owner. The permit or permits shall be valid until the end of the current calendar year and may be renewed in the same manner each successive year. A person must have a residential parking permit to be eligible to purchase a guest/service permit.

While a vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been issued is so parked, such permit shall be displayed to be clearly visible to enforcement personnel or the vehicle license plate may be registered with city. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder a parking space within the designated parking area. 
(b)  A residential parking permit shall not authorize the holder of the permit to park in spaces or areas designated by law as restricted or prohibited parking (loading zones, fire hydrants, disabled, or other such regulated areas), nor shall it exempt him from the observance of any traffic regulations, other than parking time limits.

Sec. 25-53. - General landscape requirements. 
(a)  Scope. All development shall meet or exceed the following general landscaping requirements. Landscaping shall be provided in accordance with this section prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy. 
(b)  Installation and maintenance. The installation and maintenance of landscaping shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed according to accepted commercial planting procedures. All planting areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by wheel stops or curbing. If curbing is used abutting planting areas, it shall be perforated to permit drainage from the surface drive area into the landscaped areas. 
(2)  Maintenance. The owner of a property shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in good condition so as to present a neat, healthy and orderly appearance free of refuse and debris. All planting areas shall be provided with an approved irrigation system. This system shall consist of either an underground or exposed sprinkler equipped with a time or manual switch and/or a readily available water supply. 
(c)  Plant materials. Plant materials are subject to the following: 
(1)  Quality. Plant materials used in conformance with the provisions of this article shall conform to the Standards for Florida No. 1 or better as given in Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, Part I and Current Edition, Part II, State of Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Tallahassee, or equal thereof. Plant materials determined as not meeting these standards shall not be counted towards meeting the required amount of landscape materials. 
(2)  Trees. Shade or understory trees planted as part of the required landscaping for a development shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in height and two inch dbh, when measured immediately after planting. Palm trees planted as part of the required landscaping for a development shall be six (6) feet from ground level to base of palm fronds. Shade and understory trees shall be species having an average mature crown spread of greater than fifteen (15) feet in northern Florida and having trunks which can be maintained in a clean condition for over six (6) feet of clear wood measured from the grounds. Palm trees having an average mature crown spread less than fifteen (15) feet may be grouped to create an equivalent of a fifteen-foot crown spread. 
(3)  Shrubs. Except as specifically required elsewhere in this chapter, shrubs shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches high and fifteen (15) inches wide upon installation. Shrub species not commonly available from commercial nurseries that do not meet these requirements upon installation, but which will achieve required height and mass, may be used at the discretion of the planning and building division. Good cause must be shown for the use of these shrub species, with the burden of proof upon the applicant. 
(4)  Vines. Vines shall be a minimum of thirty (30) inches in height six (6) months after planting and should be used in conjunction with fences, screens or walls to meet physical barrier requirements as specified. 
(5)  Ground covers. Ground covers other than grass shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and provide reasonably complete vegetative coverage within six (6) months after planting. 
(6)  Lawn grass. Solid sod grass shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. 
(7)  Synthetic plants and lawn. Synthetic or artificial material in the form of trees, shrubs, ground covers or vines shall not be used in lieu of plant requirements in this section. 
(8)  Planting areas. All planting areas shall be covered with mulch, grass or other ground cover where not otherwise landscaped. Mulch is required in all shrub beds, three (3) inches thick at installation and maintained at a minimum of two (2) inches thick. 
(9)  Prohibited trees. It shall be unlawful for any person to plant, cause to be planted or permit to be planted any invasive species. 
(10)  Ratio of required trees. The total combination of retained trees and new trees planted for credit shall result in the development meeting the following ratios: 
Shade trees = Fifty (50) percent minimum Understory trees = Fifty (50) percent maximum Palms = Twenty-five (25) percent maximum  
(d)  Tree mitigation. 
(1)  Preservation and removal of trees on a site to be developed may result in the need for tree mitigation. Mitigation requirement is determined by the following calculation: 
Tree saved credit-Trees removed deficit = Excess Tree Credits/Deficits 
(2)  A negative number resulting from this equation is the number of deficit points the applicant must mitigate. A positive number resulting from this equation requires no mitigation by the applicant. However, other landscape requirements still apply even if mitigation is not required (i.e. bufferyard and parking landscapes). 
(3)  Tree planting associated with internal landscaping requirements counts toward mitigation requirements. Tree planting associated with the required bufferyard planting does not count toward mitigation requirements. 
(4)  Credits and deficits are determined by the schedules presented in subparagraphs a. through c. below. 
a.  Existing trees retained or preserved. Existing trees which are retained and preserved shall receive credit points according to the following schedule: 
Three (3) inches or more but less than seven (7) inches d.b.h. ..... 1 credit

A credit of one (1) tree shall be allowed for each group of palms whose center is at least fifteen (15) feet from the center of any other tree or palm group counted as credit. 
2.  See (c)(9) of this chapter for prohibited trees. 
3.  Trees planted in bufferyards are a separate requirement and do not count toward deficit mitigation. 
(5)  Tree protection. During all phases of permitted construction, trees retained for credit shall be protected from activities such as driving or parking vehicles, adding fill soil, excavation, temporary soil storage, mechanical and chemical injury and mechanical compaction within the tree protection zone. 
a.  To protect trunks, limbs and roots from injury, a fence or barrier shall be erected to enclose the tree protection zone or a minimum area of one hundred (100) square feet per tree, whichever is greater, when any development activity or activity identified above occurs within the dripline of a tree retained for credit. Groups of trees may be protected by a fence or barrier around the entire area along the perimeter of the dripline. All development activity such as clearing and grade changes within the tree protection zone shall be supervised by a certified arborist. 
b.  To protect roots within the tree protection zone when development activity is authorized by a certified arborist the placement of six (6) inches of mulch, heavily irrigated, shall be required in advance of any such activity and removal of this mulch shall be required at the conclusion of development activity such that not more than three (3) inches of mulch remains on site. Roots greater than two (2) inches in diameter and located in the tree protection zone severed by development activities shall be pruned and treated in accordance with procedures and standards recommended by a certified arborist. 
c.  To protect the root system, no material may be stored, dumped, buried or burned within the tree protection zone. 
d.  Tree maintenance. Pruning standards for all tree work done in the city by any person or entity engaging in any professional or commercial tree removal or pruning business activity, whether for a fee or otherwise, shall follow the latest version of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A300, part 1 "pruning standards" as well as ANSI Z133.1-2000 standards for safety. The personnel and companies who do the tree work shall be jointly and severally responsible for following these pruning specifications and responsible for tree damage or loss. No topping cuts or lions-tailing cuts (over-lifting) will be permitted. 
e.  Enforcement. The applicant, permittee, landowner, and person performing the trimming are jointly and severally liable for performing maintenance under paragraph d. The applicant, landowner, and person performing the trimming are also jointly and severally subject to penalties. 
f.  Exceptions. The requirements of tree maintenance pursuant to subsection (5)d. above shall not apply to city employees acting in the enforcement of section 25-29 for abatement of sidewalk and roadway nuisances. 
(Ord. No. 04-17, § 1, 10-25-04; Ord. No. 04-24, § 1, 1-20-05; Ord. No. 09-17, § 1, 5-11-09; Ord. No. 09-19, § 2, 6-22-09; Ord. No. 15-09, § 2, 3-19-15; Ord. No. 17-14, § 1, 8-14-17) 
Sec. 25-54. - Specific landscape requirements. 
(a)  Landscaping and bufferyard requirements. All developments in the city must meet the following bufferyards and landscaping requirements: 
(1)  Classification 1- All uses except multiple family uses permitted in zoning districts RS-1, RS-2, HP-4 and HP-5. 
(2)  Classification 2- All multiple family uses and all uses permitted in zoning districts RL-1. 
(3)  Classification 3- All uses except multiple family uses permitted in zoning districts RG-1, RG-2, RGO, CL-1, HP-1, HP-2 and HP-3.

(5)  Classification 5- All uses except multiple family uses permitted in zoning districts CM-1 and CM-2. 
(6)  Classification 6- All uses permitted in zoning districts IW, GU, MU and OL. 
(7)  Bufferyard and landscaping requirements between separate uses in a planned unit development (PUD), and between the planned unit development (PUD) and adjacent property not a part of the planned unit development (PUD) shall be as established by the ordinance creating the planned unit development (PUD). 
(b)  Landscaping and bufferyards within historic preservation districts 1, 2 and 3. Within zoning districts HP-1, HP-2 and HP-3, specific bufferyard dimension requirements do not apply, but all required plant materials, walls or fences are to be installed within the site. 
(c)  Landscaping and bufferyards for single family uses. Single family uses shall not be required to meet bufferyard requirements, but shall be required to submit a site plan as defined in this chapter for review prior to issuance of a building permit. Single family uses shall only be required to replace existing trees removed as the result of permitted construction. 
(d)  Intent of bufferyards. The bufferyard is a unit of yard with required landscaping. Both the amount of land and the type and amount of landscaping required for each bufferyard are designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public street. These bufferyards have been calculated to insure that they do function as "buffers." 
(e)  Bufferyards required. Bufferyards shall be required to eliminate or reduce potential nuisances, such as dirt, litter, noise, glare, unsightly buildings or parking lots, and to provide spacing to reduce the adverse impacts of noise, odor, danger from fire, and differing intensities of land use. 
(f)  Bufferyards San Marco Avenue Design Standards. Developments that must comply with the San Marco Avenue Design Standards, and which use the residential typology, may locate the required front landscaping bufferyard anywhere between the front building façade and the front property line. The planted area must contain the equivalent front bufferyard planting requirements. 
(g)  Location of required bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located along the perimeter of the property being developed, abutting the property line. Bufferyards shall not be located on an existing or dedicated public right-of-way. 
(1)  Table of bufferyard requirements. The letter designations contained in this table refer to the specific required bufferyards contained in subsection (f)(3) below. Use of native vegetation shall reduce the required number of plant units by ten (10) percent in those bufferyards where a fence is not required.

(4)  Parking area requirements. 
a.  Adjacent to public rights-of-way. Bufferyards between parking areas and public rights-of-way shall form a solid opaque mass or screen of landscaping at least twenty-four (24) inches in height upon planting. This bufferyard may be composed of a berm with a maximum height of thirty (30) inches in conjunction with landscaping, with a total height of not less than thirty-six (36) inches in height at installation. A wall or fence of at least thirty-six (36) inches in height, but less than forty-eight (48) inches in height may be used in conjunction with landscaping, with the wall or fence installed adjacent to the parking area and the required landscaping installed between the wall or fence and the property line. When a mass or screen of landscape material is used, it shall obtain opacity within twelve (12) months of planting under normal growing conditions. 
b.  Intersection visibility. Where an accessway intersects a public right-of-way, landscaping shall be used to define the intersection provided, however, that all landscaping within the triangular areas described below shall provide unobstructed cross visibility at a level between two (2) and six (6) feet above the ground. Trees having limbs and foliage extending into this cross visibility area shall be allowed, provided that they are so located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except grass and ground cover, shall not be located closer than three (3) feet from the edge of any accessway pavement. The triangular areas are: 
1.  The areas of property on both sides of an accessway formed by the intersection of each side of the accessway and the public right-of-way pavement line with two (2) sides of each triangle being ten (10) feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends or the other sides. 
2.  The area of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two (2) or more public rights-of-way with two (2) sides of the triangular areas being measured thirty (30) feet in length along the abutting edges of pavement, from their point of intersection, and the third being a line connecting the ends of the other two (2) lines. 
c.  Adjacent to other properties. Where parking areas are adjacent to surrounding properties, landscaping shall be installed to screen parking areas from adjacent properties. All land between parking areas and the property line shall be screened with a wall or fence, or a combination of a berm, hedge or other landscaping at least forty-eight (48) inches in height at installation which shall form a continuous opaque screen under normal growing conditions. 
d.  Adjacent to residentially zoned properties. Whenever a parking facility containing ten (10) or more spaces is located closer than fifteen (15) feet to a residentially zoned lot, and is not entirely screened visually by intervening structures, a continuous opaque screen at least six (6) feet in height shall be provided along the adjoining property line. This screen shall consist of a solid wall or fence, or a mass of shrubbery at least five (5) feet in height at the time of installation. This screening requirement shall be in addition to any other landscape or bufferyard requirements. 
(5)  Internal landscaping. All parking areas shall have internal landscaping to provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of pavement, and to direct and define logical areas for pedestrian and vehicular circulation. 
a.  Within each parking area of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more, there shall be a minimum of five (5) percent of landscaped areas which shall be reasonably distributed within each five thousand (5,000) square feet of parking area so as to be prorated to fulfill the objectives of this article. 
b.  Each separate planting area shall contain at least one (1) tree and a tree shall be planted for each one hundred (100) square feet of internal landscaping. All internal landscaping shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbing or wheel stops. All landscape areas shall be a minimum of one hundred (100) square feet, with the least dimension being five (5) feet.

(2)  Permits for removal or relocation of trees associated with a site plan for a development shall be obtained by making application for permit for the development to the city planning and building division. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan. When the permit for the development is issued it will include tree removal, relocation and replacement as indicated on the approved site plan for the development. 
(c)  Application review. Upon receipt of a complete application, which may include a site plan for a development, the city planning and building division shall review such application which may include a field check of the site and referral of the application to other departments or agencies as necessary to determine any adverse effect upon the general public welfare, adjacent properties or city services and facilities. 
(1)  The planning and building division may issue a tree removal permit for trees which are not considered preserved trees. 
(2)  To remove a preserved tree anywhere on site, approval shall first be given by the code enforcement, adjustments and appeals board, or by the planning and zoning board, if such approval is related to the review of a site plan. 
(3)  In determining whether or not a permit required by this section should be issued, the city planning and building division shall consider and base all decisions on the following: 
a.  The condition of the tree with respect to disease, insect attack, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interferences with utility services. 
b.  The necessity of removing a tree to construct proposed improvements in order to allow reasonable economic use of the property. 
c.  The relief of the land where the tree is located and the effect removal of the tree would have on erosion, soil moisture retention, diversion, increased or decreased flow of surface waters and the city master drainage plan or similar plan adopted by the city commission.

(d)  Issuance of permit. The planning and building division shall issue the removal permit unless, upon consideration of the criteria set forth above, the division finds any of the following will result: 
(1)  That the property owner or agent will not be unreasonably affected in shifting the location of the proposed structure, building or improvement, which shift will maintain the existence of the subject trees and still permit construction of such building or improvement on the site. 
(2)  That the property owner or agent will not be unreasonably affected in modifying the design of the proposed structure, building or other improvement, which modification will maintain the existence of the trees proposed to be removed and still permit construction substantially similar to that originally proposed. 
(3)  That the removal of the subject trees will have a substantial adverse impact on the urban and natural environment. 
(4)  That the subject trees are preserved trees and removal must be reviewed by the code enforcement, adjustments and appeals board or the planning and zoning board. 
(e)  Denial of permit. If the planning and building division denies the removal permit it shall set forth with particularity its reasons for such denial in writing. 
(f)  Appeals. When a tree removal permit, including a permit for the removal of a preserved tree not involved with a site plan for new development, has been denied by the planning and building division, the property owner or agent may appeal this decision to the code enforcement, adjustments and appeals board. The code enforcement, adjustments and appeals board shall approve or deny the appeal and may impose conditions as required, such as specific tree species and sizes for the required replacement trees. The board may require more stringent replacement requirements than is required by this chapter. The code enforcement, adjustments and appeals board shall not be empowered to relax the standards and requirements contained herein. If a preserved tree is approved by the board to be removed, a minimum of two (2) shade trees a minimum of ten (10) feet in height shall be used as replacement. The replacement of trees that have been removed after board approval shall be done within thirty (30) days after the tree has been removed. 
(g)  Relocation and replacement. As condition to the granting of a permit, the property owner or agent will be required to relocate the tree being removed or required to replace the tree being removed with a tree somewhere within the site. Native vegetation shall be replaced with native vegetation. Shade trees must be replaced by shade trees. Understory and palm trees may be replaced by any type tree. Replacement shade trees shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet high and understory trees shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet high when planted. Each Southern Red Cedar tree (juniperus silicicola) removed shall be replaced with a minimum of two (2) Southern Red Cedars of such a size and quality as shall be determined by the city building official to be assured of such Southern Red Cedars' continued viability and growth. The property owner or agent shall also be required to replace the relocated or replacement tree should same die within three (3) years from date of planting. 
(h)  Public lands. No tree shall be removed from any public property or public right-of-way except in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(i)  "After the fact" tree removal permits.

a.  One hundred dollars ($100.00) for each tree three (3) inches or more but less than seven (7) inches dbh. 
b.  Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each tree seven (7) inches or more but less than twelve (12) inches dbh. 
c.  Four hundred dollars ($400.00) for each tree twelve (12) inches or more but less than twenty (20) inches dbh. 
d.  Eight hundred dollars ($800.00) for each tree twenty (20) inches or more dbh. 
(2)  The planning and building director may issue an "after the fact" tree removal permit for trees which are not considered preserved trees, but only after considering the above mentioned factors and the reason why a permit was not obtained prior to the removal. 
(3)  If the planning and building director denies the "after the fact" tree removal permit, he/she shall set forth with particularity the reasons for such denial in writing. When such permit is denied, said denial may be appealed as stated above to the adjustments and appeals board. 
(4)  No "after the fact" tree removal permits shall be issued for the removal of preserved trees. Any such action shall be subject to code enforcement proceedings wherein any explanation or reason for removal without a permit and evidence as to the tree's condition prior to removal may be presented as mitigation.

(f)  Flow determinations based on persons or occupant load. Flow determinations based on persons or occupant load shall be based on the maximum occupancy permitted by the current city building and life safety codes. 
(g)  Estimated water or wastewater flow deficient of established flows. In the event that the city manager determines the long-term impact of water or wastewater flow to the city's utility system to be deficient of the flow established above based on billing history of similar uses or other data submitted by the applicant's architect, landscape architect, engineer or other professional consultant, then the flow proportional connection charges may be based on the lesser flow amount. This provision is intended for specially engineered systems outside of conventional water or wastewater plumbing. 
(h)  Abandoned or inactive service. In the case where utility service to a property has been inactive, abandoned or otherwise unused without payment of service or flow through the service either water or sewer in excess of ten (10) years from the last known paid utility bill, the property is considered abandoned and carries no credit for flow based fees for the property. To re-establish service the application is treated as new service whereby new taps, service line, laterals and payment of the flow proportional connection charges shall be required in accordance with this chapter as if a new property. 
(i)  Alternative fee calculation. 
(1)  In the event an applicant or owner believes that the connection to the water system, the sewer system or both, necessitated by the owner's development justifies a fee that is less than the fee calculated in this article, such applicant or owner may submit a calculation of an alternative water system and/or alternative sewer system connection fee to the city manager pursuant to the provisions of this section. The decision of the city manager shall serve as the final administrative appeal. 
(2)  In the case of new construction, any right to submit an alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or alternative sewer system connection fee calculation shall be deemed to have been waived and expired, and such calculation shall not be considered by the city commission, if not properly and timely made in accordance with this ordinance prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  In the case of existing buildings, structures or applicable improvements which are required to connect to the potable water system, sewer system or both systems, any right to submit an alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or, alternative sewer system connection fee calculation shall be deemed to have been waived and expired, and such calculation shall not be considered by the city commission, if within thirty (30) calendar days from the effective date of issuance of the "letter of availability" under this article, the owner does not notify the city manager in writing of the owner's intention to submit an alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or alternative sewer system connection fee calculation. 
(4)  Notification and submission of an alternative water and/or wastewater system connection fee calculation. Any owner who wishes to submit an alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or an alternative sewer system connection fee calculation must timely submit to the city manager the applicable calculation along with an administrative review fee of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for each alternative connection fee. If a combined alternative water and sewer connection fee calculation is submitted, the administrative review fee shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00). In order to be deemed timely submitted, all necessary documents and fees must be submitted to the city manager or his/her designee, no later than ninety (90) days from the date of issuance of the "letter of availability". Any late filed submittal shall be deemed to have been waived and expired, and such alternative calculation shall not be considered by the city commission. 
(5)  Upon timely submission of an alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or alternative sewer system connection fee calculation, the basis for it and receipt of the alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or alternative sewer system connection fee calculation, the city manager shall review the alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee calculation and shall make final determination of the alternative fee calculation. 
(6)  The alternative water system connection fee calculation and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee calculation shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this article, as amended from time to time, or an alternative water system connection fee study and/or an alternative sewer system connection fee study based upon a calculation prepared by a Florida Professional Engineer who certifies that the flows and corresponding ERCs are reasonable relative to the development. Any such Florida Professional Engineer must include a local study supported by data adequate for the conclusions contained in such study, performed according to a generally accepted methodology and based upon generally accepted standard sources of information relating to facilities planning, cost analysis and demographics. The Florida Professional Engineer must provide competent, substantial evidence that the alternative water system connection fee and/or alternative sewer system connection fee represent an equitable determination of the water and/or sewer flow demand requirements in order to determine the amount of gallons to be allocated to the applicant to determine the number of ERCs and the pro rata share of the cost of capital improvements and additions to the water system and/or sewer system necessitated by the subject development. 
(7)  If during a prior alternative fee calculation process an acceptable alternative water system connection fee study and/or alternative sewer system connection fee study substantially consistent with the criteria required by this article have been accepted by the city manager, and if any such study is determined by the city manager to be then current (no greater than two years old) and applicable, the connection of such previously approved development shall be presumed to be as described in the prior study. In such circumstances, an alternative water system connection fee and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee shall be established reflecting the connection described in the prior study. There shall be a presumption that such a connection study based upon an independent source conducted and accepted by the city manager more than two (2) years earlier is no longer current and not applicable. 
(8)  If the city manager determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative water system connection fee and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee complies with the requirements of this article and that the alternative water system connection fee and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee were calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, then the alternative water system connection fee and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee set forth in this article. 
(9)  If the city manager determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative water system connection fee and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee do not comply with the requirements of this article or that the alternative water system connection fee and/or the alternative sewer system connection fee were not calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, then the city shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification within five (5) business dates of such determination, of the rejection of the alternative water system connection fee, the alternative sewer system connection fee or both and the reason or reasons for the rejection. 
(10)  The final decision of the city manager shall be in writing and issued within sixty (60) calendar days receipt of complete and sufficient application per these articles. 
(11)  Any applicant or owner who or which has submitted a proposed alternative water system connection fee and/or alternative sewer system connection fee pursuant to this article and desires the immediate issuance of a building permit shall pay the required fees prior to or at the time of submittal of the proposed alternative fees. Such payment shall be deemed paid under "protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any right of review. Any difference between the amount paid and the amount due, as determined by the city manager, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner or paid to the city, as applicable. 
(12)  If an applicant has paid the water and/or sewer connection fees in accordance with an approved alternative water and/or sewer connection fee request, respectively and after connection to the utility the applicant incurs an average daily flow for a connection during an consecutive twelve-month periods in an amount greater than the average daily flow for which the connections fees have been paid, an additional capacity fee shall be assessed for the excess flow based on the connection fee in effect at the time of determination. If the average daily flow during any consecutive three-month period is more than fifteen (15) percent greater than the average daily flow for which connection fees have been paid, an additional connection fee shall be assessed for the excess flow.

Sec. 26-77. - Approval authority. 
    The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) is the approval authority. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 26-78. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
(a)  General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass-through or interference. These prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(b)  Specific prohibitions. No user is allowed to introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or wastewater: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flash point of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees F (sixty (60) C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
(2)  Wastewater having a pH less than five (5.0) or more than nine (9.0) or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which may obstruct the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case solids greater than two (2) inches in any dimension; 
(4)  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (CBOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration, which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
(5)  Wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred fifty (150) degrees F (sixty-five and one-half (65.5) C) which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four (104) degrees F (forty (40) C); 
(6)  Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through; 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
(8)  Hauled waste or pollutants, except at discharge points specifically designated by the city manager according to section 26-84 of this Code; 
(9)  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
(10)  Wastewater imparting color that cannot be removed by the treatment process, including dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions; 
(11)  Wastewater containing radioactive wastes or isotopes, except in compliance with applicable federal or state regulations;

(16)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances that may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
(17)  Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in concentrations greater than the established local limit, or any grease trap or grease interceptor waste; 
(18)  Hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261. 
(c)  Processing and storage restrictions. No user shall process or store pollutants, substances or wastewater prohibited by this article in such a manner that they could enter the POTW. 
(d)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste must notify the city manager, the EPA regional waste management division director, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection hazardous waste and pretreatment authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification must also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimate of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted as required by section 26-100 of this Code. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this chapter. 
(e)  Exemptions. Users are exempt from the requirements of subsection (d) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Following the one-time notification, users discharging more than these quantities of any hazardous waste are not required to additionally notify the city manager. 
(f)  Impact of new regulations. In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city manager, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the new regulation. 
(g)  Reduction of hazardous wastes. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user must certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree the user has determined it to be economically practical. 
(h)  Rights of discharge limited. This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Code, by any wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, or by any applicable federal or state law.

    The categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, are hereby incorporated. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the city manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with Rule 62-625.410(4), F.A.C. 
(2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in Rule 62-625.410(6), F.A.C. 
(3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in Rule 62-625.700, F.A.C., that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard according to Rule 62-625.820, F.A.C. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02; Ord. No. 05-08, § 3, 5-23-05; Ord. No. 08-11, § 2, 6-23-08; Ord. No. 11-25, § 4, 10-24-11) 
Sec. 26-80. - Local limits and right of revision. 
(a)  Local limits. The city hereby adopts the standards and requirements established by the applicable parts of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 400-699) in industrial user permits. As appropriate, local limits governing discharges to the POTW through industrial user permits will be developed by the city and approved by Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The local limits governing discharges to the POTW effective on November 4, 2011 are hereby adopted, ratified and implemented into the City Code by reference. The city manager is granted the authority to make amendments to said local limits as the city manager finds necessary. 
(b)  No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the local limits for those pollutants which limits have been established for the City of St. Augustine's WWTP using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to the FDEP to protect against pass through, interference, protection of WWTP employees and adverse affects on wastewater residuals disposal. No industrial user shall discharge process waste streams or unregulated waste streams or shall dilute waste streams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the city manager. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each SIU wastewater permit issued. 
(c)  The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, WWTP operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation shall be effective thirty (30) days from notice of acceptance of the modified limits by FDEP. Permitted SIUs shall also be issued an addendum to their wastewater discharge permit containing the new local limits. 
(d)  The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. At his or her discretion, the city manager may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations. 
(e)  The city manager may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of section 26-78. 
(f)  Right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements than those specifically established by 40 CFR or Chapter 62-625 FAC on discharges to the POTW. 
(g)  A copy of the approved local limits is available upon request at the following location: City of St. Augustine City Hall, 75 King Street, St. Augustine, Florida 32084.

The user must provide, operate, and maintain any facilities required to meet the requirements of this Code, at the user's expense. The user must submit detailed plans and operating procedures of such facilities to the city manager. The city manager will review and approve such plans and operating procedures in writing before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures in no way relieves the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge meeting the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Dilution. Increasing the use of process water, or in any way attempting to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate pretreatment, to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless specifically authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement is prohibited. The city manager may impose mass limits on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(c)  Discharge restrictions authorized. The city manager may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, to discharge certain wastewater only into specific sewers, to relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, and/or to separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams. The city manager may also require a user to take any other action necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(d)  Flow equalization. The city manager may require any user to install and maintain, on the user's property and at the user's expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow.

(1)  The city manager may require the user to submit information necessary to evaluate the proposed changed conditions and may require the user to submit a wastewater discharge permit application. 
(2)  The city manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  Modifying an existing wastewater discharge permit may require advance approval from EPA. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 26-101. - Reports of discharges causing potential problems. 
(a)  Initial notification. In the case of any discharge that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user must immediately telephone and notify the city manager of the incident. Such discharges include, but are not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine or episodic nature, non-customary batch discharges, and a slug discharge or slug load. Notification must include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b)  Written notification. Within five (5) working days following such discharge, the user must submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Notification does not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which the user incurs as a result of damage to the POTW or natural resources or of any other damage to persons or property, nor does notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
(c)  Posting notification procedures required. The user must permanently post a notice on the user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) above.

(a)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(b)  Sampling and analysis techniques. Sampling and analytical method requirements must comply with 40 CFR Part 136, paragraph 62-625.600(1)(e), F.A.C., Chapter 62-160, F.A.C., and the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities, DEP-SOP-001/01 (DEP-SOP-001, FS2400, Wastewater Sampling). If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, the sampling organization, with the approval of the industrial user and control authority, shall identify and propose a method for use in accordance with Rule 62-160.220, F.A.C. 
(c)  Flow proportional sampling. Except as specified by subsections (d) and (f) below, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained using flow proportional collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the city manager may authorize time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that these techniques will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in Chapter 62-160, F.A.C., and DEP-SOP-001/01, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved DEP sampling procedures and laboratory methodologies may be authorized by the city manager, as appropriate. Additionally, the city manager may require grab samples to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(d)  Grab collection sampling. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(e)  Oil and grease samples. Oil and grease samples shall be collected in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) above unless the sampling location or point cannot be physically accessed to perform a direct collection of a grab sample. In these instances, the sample shall be pumped from the sampling location or point into the sample container using a peristaltic-type pump. All pump tubing used for sample collection must be new or pre-cleaned and must be changed between sample containers and sample points. The pump tubing shall not be pre-rinsed or flushed with sample prior to collection of the sample.

Sec. 26-103. - Record keeping. 
    Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter must retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information related to monitoring activities required by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under section 26-80. Records must include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling; the name(s) of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; name(s) of the person(s) performing the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records must remain available for a period of at least five (5) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the city manager has specifically notified the user of a longer retention period. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02; Ord. No. 11-25, § 14, 10-24-11) 
Sec. 26-104. - Right of entry for inspection and sampling. 
    The city manager has the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with the provisions of this chapter, any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement. Users are required to allow the city manager ready access to all parts of the user's premises for inspection, sampling, examining and copying records, and performing any other duties specified by this chapter. 
(1)  Where a user's security system requires identification and clearance of persons before entering the premises, the user is required to make all necessary arrangements to allow the city manager, upon presenting suitable identification, to enter the premises without delay to administer and enforce this chapter. 
(2)  The city manager has the right to install sampling or monitoring equipment on the user's premises. 
(3)  The city manager may require the user to install sampling or monitoring equipment. The user, at the user's expense, must maintain all sampling and monitoring equipment in safe and proper operating condition at all times. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality must be certified as required by the manufacturer, but not less than annually, and must be calibrated prior to use to ensure accuracy. 
(4)  At the written or verbal request of the city manager, the user must promptly remove any temporary or permanent obstructions preventing safe and easy access to the premises for inspection or sampling. The user cannot thereafter replace any such obstructions. The user must bear the costs of removing such obstructions. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city manager access to the user's premises are a violation of this chapter. 
(6)  In the event that the city manager is refused access to a user's premises, or any part thereof, as part of administering or enforcing this chapter, the city manager may seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to allow access. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 26-105. - Confidential information. 
    The city manager shall generally make information and data related to a user obtained by enforcing and implementing this chapter available to the public without restriction. However, the user may request that certain information and data not be made available to the public because it would divulge trade secrets protected under state law. If the user so requests, and is able to demonstrate to the city manager that the release of such information and data would divulge trade secrets protected under state law, then the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets will not be made available to the public. The user must make such a request, in writing, at the time the information or data is submitted. Such information or data will be made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the information or data. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data defined by 40 CFR 2.302 are not recognized as confidential information and are available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 26-106. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The city manager will publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the city where the POTW is located, a list of users who were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during the previous twelve (12) months. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02) 
Sec. 26-107. - Notice of violation, repeat sampling and reporting. 
    If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user must repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the report analysis to the city manager within fourteen (14) calendar days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02; Ord. No. 11-25, § 15, 10-24-11) 
Sec. 26-108. - Violations and enforcement. 
    If a user violates any provision of this chapter, any condition of a wastewater discharge permit, any condition of any order issued pursuant to this chapter, any pretreatment standard or requirement, or willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage, then the city manager may take against the user all or any, in any combination, in any order, of the listed enforcement actions. Taking a single enforcement action does not bar against, nor is a prerequisite for, taking other enforcement action against the user. 
(1)  Notice of violation. The city manager may issue the user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the notice of violation, the user must submit to the city manager: An explanation for the violation; a plan for correcting the violation; and a plan to prevent future violations, including specific required actions. Submitting this plan does not relieve the user of liability for any violations occurring either before or after receiving the notice of violation. 
(2)  Consent orders. The city manager may enter into a consent order, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar document establishing an agreement with any noncompliant user. Such documents must include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the violation within a specific time period. Such documents have the same force and effect as the compliance orders and cease and desist orders issued pursuant to this Code and are judicially enforceable. 
(3)  Show cause hearing. The city manager may order the user to appear before the city manager and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice will be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting will be served personally or by certified mail return receipt at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. 
(4)  Compliance orders. The city manager may order the noncompliant user to come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the specified time, then sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also establish other requirements, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order does not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement. A compliance order does not relieve the user of liability for any violation. 
(5)  Cease and desist orders. The city manager may order the user to cease and desist all violations, and direct the user to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
b.  Take necessary corrective or preventive action to properly address an existing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(6)  Administrative fines and liens. The city manager may fine a noncompliant user an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day. Such fines are assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines will be assessed for each day during the period of violation. Unpaid fines, after ninety (90) calendar days, may be recorded as a lien against the user's property. 
(7)  Emergency suspensions. The city manager may order a user to immediately suspend its discharge when an actual or threatened discharge reasonably appears to cause imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, interfere with the operation of the POTW and/or its effluent discharge limitations, or endanger the environment. If the user fails to immediately comply with the suspension order, the city manager may disconnect or plug the user's sewer service. A noncompliant user responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge causing imminent endangerment, must submit a detailed written statement to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. 
(8)  Termination of discharge. The city manager may terminate the discharge of any user who does any of the following. The city manager will notify such user a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the termination. 
a.  Violates wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Fails to accurately report wastewater constituents and discharge characteristics; 
c.  Fails to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refuses to allow the city manager reasonable access to the user's premises for inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
e.  Violates the pretreatment standards established by this Code. 
(9)  Injunctive relief. The city manager may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city manager may also seek other action appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. 
(10)  Civil penalties. The city manager may file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to impose a minimum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. Penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. The city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(11)  Criminal prosecution. The city manager may file criminal charges in any court of competent jurisdiction against the noncompliant user. The user shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a minimum fine of one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars per violation per day, or imprisonment for not more than sixty (60) calendar days, or both. In the case of a user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW causing personal injury or property damage, this penalty shall be in addition to any other action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(12)  Disconnecting water supply and sewer service. The city manager may disconnect the water service and/or sewer service to the noncompliant user. Service will be restored, at the user's expense, only after the user demonstrates the ability to comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 5, 3-11-02; Ord. No. 11-25, § 16, 10-24-11) 
Sec. 26-109. - Upset, affirmative defense and bypass. 
(a)  [Upset.] An upset does not constitute noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with the categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) below are met. 
(c)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of an upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(2)  The industrial user's facility was, at the time of the upset, being properly operated; and 
(3)  The industrial user has orally submitted the following information to the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, with a written submission to be provided within five (5) days: 
a.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of noncompliance. 
(d)  Industrial user responsibility in case of an upset. The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(e)  Affirmative defense. A user has an affirmative defense to enforcement action brought against it for violating section 26-78 of this Code if the user can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference in the POTW, and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged, and the user was in compliance with each local limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(f)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or the requirements to be violated, but only if it is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of (g), (h) and (i) below. 
(g)  Notice in the event of anticipated bypass. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user must notify the city manager at least ten (10) calendar days before the date of the bypass. If the industrial user does not know of the need for a bypass ten days prior to the bypass then the industrial user shall notify the city manager immediately upon knowledge of the need for a bypass. 
(h)  Notice in the event of an unanticipated bypass. A user must submit oral notice to the city manager of any unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The user must follow up with written notification to the city manager within five (5) calendar days of the date the user became aware of the bypass. The written notification must contain: A description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, how long it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. 
(i)  Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority shall take enforcement against an individual for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(3)  The user submitted notices as required in this paragraph. 
(j)  Anticipated bypass approval. The city manager shall approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (i) of this section.

This style is simple, functional and unpretentious. The style is described and documented in the book "The Houses of St. Augustine" by Albert Manucy, published by the St. Augustine Historical Society in 1962. 
(1)  Houses were built flush with the street line, with the remainder of the front line enclosed by a wall or fence through which access was gained to the side yard and the house. A few doors opened directly on the street after 1763. Houses imparted a massive but well-proportioned look and were one (1) to two and one-half (21/2) stories in height. The most common floor plan was a simple rectangle with a loggia to the side or rear. Stairs to upper floors were located at one (1) end of the loggia in a protected alcove. Some houses had an added wing, and a few were U-shaped. 
(2)  Ground level floors were of tabby (shell concrete) at or near grade, although some wooden floors set close to the ground appeared late. Wooden second floors were carried on exposed beams. Tabby or coquina walls were always plastered inside and out. White is the only color described and was dominant well into the 19th century. Some late exterior walls were scored in ashlar pattern. Openings were generally large. Early doors were heavy and solid, the six-panel door appearing after 1763. Windows with inside shutters and protecting wooden grills (rejas) were the rule until 1763. Iron grillwork was never characteristic of Spanish St. Augustine. After 1763 double-hung windows with glass panes appeared, and shutters moved to the outside. All woodwork was simple and somewhat heavy. Street balconies were common, the early forms supported by corbelled beams. Some second stories were of wood, usually clapboard. Chimneys were rare before 1763, common thereafter. Decoration and ornamentation was minimal and simple. 
(3)  Before 1763 flat roofs were present, particularly on masonry houses; they were rare thereafter. Pitched roofs of both gable and hip types were most common and were covered with thatch or wooden shingles. Tiled roofs are not characteristic of St. Augustine style. 
(4)  In interpreting St. Augustine architecture as a basis for construction under this chapter, aspects of scale, proportion, fabric and texture shall approach the historic modes insofar as possible and practical; but the rule shall be to give reasonable latitude for modifications and adaptations necessitated by modern use and convenience, both in business and residential construction.

No variance shall be granted unless the applicant shall show and the board shall find that: 
a.  The particular property, because of size, shape, topography or other physical conditions, suffers singular disadvantage through the operation of this section, which disadvantage does not apply to other properties in the vicinity; and 
b.  Because of this disadvantage, the owner is unable to make reasonable use of the affected property; and

d.  Grant of the variance will not be contrary to the public interest; will not adversely affect other property in the vicinity; and will be in harmony with the spirit, intent and purpose of this section. 
In passing upon a request for variance, the board shall not consider prospective financial loss or gain to the owner or applicant, nor shall the board by variance permit to be established or carried on in any use district an activity, business or operation which is not otherwise allowed in such district by a specific provision of this chapter. 
Within the historic preservation zoning districts 1, 2 and 3 and national register districts, the board may grant a request for variance for architectural or historic reasons, provided that the variance is necessary for the construction or reconstruction of buildings or structures in the appropriate historic architectural style or form, based upon review of the historic architectural review board's recommendations. The board shall find that granting the variance will not be contrary to the public interest; will not adversely affect other property and structures in the district; and will be in harmony with the spirit, intent and purpose of this section. 
(2)  Written application. All applications for variance from this chapter shall be in writing and in such form as may be determined by the board. 
(3)  Public hearing. Unless a longer time shall be agreed upon by the applicant and the board in the particular case, a public hearing shall be held by the board to consider an application for a zoning variance within not more than thirty (30) days from the date of filing of the complete application.

(d)  Appeals: Review of planning and building department; decision by the board: 
(1)  In general. Any appeal as provided herein, including requests for variances from the design standards for off-street parking, may be taken by any person aggrieved by any decision of the planning and building department or any administrative official or official body in the administration or enforcement of this chapter, provided such appeal is filed with the planning and building department within thirty (30) days of the date of the action which is the subject of such appeal. The party filing the appeal shall have legal standing, as determined under the laws of the State of Florida and rules of civil procedure or appellate procedure as established by the Supreme Court of the State of Florida. 
(2)  Reviewing authority. For the purposes of this Code, "reviewing authority" shall mean the person, board or commission which is designated by this Code to hear and render a decision on an appeal. 
(3)  Written application. A written application shall be filed on the forms provided by the planning and building department and shall state, with particularity, specific grounds for the appeal, including the factual and legal basis, which must be based on established law as it relates to the action taken by the official, board or commission upon which the appeal is filed. The official, board or commission which will hear the appeal as the reviewing authority may review the application for appeal prior to hearing and may request that additional information be filed, in writing, in the form of a brief or other formal statement. Based upon the application for appeal and such other information that is filed, such reviewing authority may summarily affirm the order to be reviewed if the authority finds that no preliminary basis for reversal has been demonstrated, or may summarily reverse the order to be reviewed if the reviewing authority finds that no meritorious basis exists for affirmance and the order otherwise is subject to reversal. 
(4)  Hearing. In the event that the board, commission or other reviewing authority has not summarily reversed or affirmed the order in question, the reviewing authority shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such application, set a reasonable time for hearing thereon and shall give notice of the time and place of the hearing to the applicant and the planning and building department and any other parties to the proceeding. 
(5)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all administrative proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed until such time as final determination has been made by the reviewing authority on such appeal, and no action shall be taken by the applicant or the planning and building department during such time which would change the status of the matter being appealed. 
(e)  Procedures for hearing for zoning exceptions, zoning; variances, conservation zone developments and appeals: 
(1)  Scope. The board shall adhere to the standards applicable in quasi-judicial hearings consistent with Florida law, and may utilize the rules for the conduct of hearings adopted by the city commission, or provide for guidelines specific to hearings related to the granting of zoning exceptions, zoning variances, conservation zone developments and appeals, which shall include at least the right of any party to: 
a.  Present their case or defense by oral and documentary evidence. 
b.  Submit rebuttal evidence, and conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. 
c.  Submit proposed legal argument, findings and conclusions and supporting reasons therefor. 
d.  Make offers of compromise or proposals of adjustments. 
e.  Be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel or represent themselves. 
f.  Be promptly notified of any action taken on any zoning exception request or a zoning variance, conservation zone development, or appeal of any action of the board affecting substantive or procedural rights taken in connection with proceedings. 
(2)  Evidence. The board shall receive into evidence that which could be admissible in civil proceedings in the courts of this state, but in receiving evidence due regard shall be given to the technical and highly complicated subject matter which must be handled and the exclusionary rules of evidence shall not be used to prevent the receipt of evidence having substantial probative effect. Otherwise, however, effect shall be given to rules of evidence recognized by state law. 
(3)  Record. The board shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a record of the hearing by the city clerk for all application requests considered by it. The board shall establish such record in a sufficient degree to disclose the factual basis for its final determination with respect to such requests and appeals. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or if absent or failing to vote indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its official actions, all of which shall be a public record and filed immediately in the planning and building department and preserved with the city clerk. A verbatim transcript of the hearing is required for an appeal to the city commission, and may be required for other judicial proceedings. It is the responsibility of the appellant to obtain a complete record of the hearing from the city clerk and to retain a certified court reporter to transcribe the hearing at appellant's cost. For purposes of appeals to the city commission, persons who meet the qualifications of indigency and who have filed a complete indigency application with the city clerk pursuant to this code, may provide an alternative to the certified court reporter transcript, such as providing an audio-visual recording of the proceedings on appeal. 
(4)  Orders. A final order on each request for a zoning exception or zoning variance and each appeal shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days of the last hearing at which such request or appeal was considered. Each final order shall contain the citation to the applicable legal authority for the denial of the permit upon which the board's order is based and may include additional findings and conclusions of law, as well as, such conditions and safeguards as prescribed by the board as are appropriate in the matter, including but not limited to, reasonable time limits within which action pursuant to such order shall be begun or completed or both. The record shall contain all evidence, testimony and findings placed in the record of the hearing without the need to reiterate the same in the final order. The originals of the application and all orders of the board and one (1) copy of the final order shall be furnished to the planning and building department and to the applicant. 
(f)  Limitations on exceptions, variances and conservation zone developments. Exceptions, variances and conservation zone developments shall be non-transferable and granted to the applicant only, and the exception, variance or development shall be commenced within a period of one (1) year from the effective date of the final order granting same; provided, however, that the chief building official may grant no more than two (2) ninety-day extensions for the commencement of construction pursuant to any exception or variance or conservation zone development approval granted by the planning and zoning board upon written application showing good cause for such extension of the variance or exception showing no changes to the proposed project or use have been made which will affect the variance or use to be extended; and provided, further, the board may adopt the following conditions to any exception or variance: 
(1)  That the exception, variance or conservation zone development will be transferable and run with the land when the facts involved warrant same or where construction or land development is included as part of the exception or variance. 
(2)  The time within which the exception, variance or conservation zone development shall be commenced may be extended for a period of time longer than one (1) year. Failure to exercise the exception, variance or conservation zone development by commencement of the use or action approved thereby within one (1) year, or such longer time as approved by the board, shall render the exception, variance or conservation zone development invalid and all rights granted thereunder shall terminate. Transfer of the property by the applicant, unless the exception, variance or conservation zone development runs with the land, shall terminate the exception, variance or development. 
(3)  Whenever the board has granted an exception or variance to the zoning code, it shall not then consider any petition for an exception or variance on any part or all of the same property for a period of one (1) year from the effective date of the order granting the exception or variance. 
(4)  Whenever the board has denied an application for an exception or variance no further application shall be filed for the same exception or variance on any part or all of the same property for a period of one (1) year from the date of such action. In the event that two (2) or more applications for the same exception or variance on any part or all of the same property has been denied, no further application shall be filed for the same exception or variance on any part or all of the same property for a period of two (2) years from the date of such action denying the last application filed. 
(5)  The time limits of subsections (3) and (4) may be waived by the affirmative votes of a majority of the board when such action is deemed necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the city. 
(g)  Review of board decisions by commission. Decisions of the board in the granting of appeals, preliminary subdivision plats, exceptions, conservation zone developments, variances, and comprehensive plan amendments and rezonings shall be subject to review by the city commission on appeal: 
(1)  An appeal may be taken by any person demonstrating sufficient standing consistent with Florida law and aggrieved by the decision of the board provided such appeal is filed with the planning and building department during regular office hours no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the rendered order which is the subject of such appeal. To be considered timely filed, appellant must file the required form and provide any required payment for filing fees at the time of filing. If the thirtieth (30th) day from the date of the rendered order falls on a date and time when the planning and building department is closed, any attempted filing on or after that date and time will be considered untimely and no additional time will be granted for late filing. The party filing the appeal shall have legal standing, as determined under the laws of the State of Florida and rules of civil procedure or appellate procedure as established by the Supreme Court of the State of Florida. 
(2)  A notice of appeal shall be filed on the forms established and provided by the planning and building department and shall include all pertinent information required thereon and any applicable filing fee. A notice of appeal filed in compliance with code requirements by the owner of the property seeking a development permit shall be deemed legally sufficient to proceed to the substantive appeal hearing. If the property owner's notice of appeal is not filed in compliance with code requirements, the city commission will review the application for appeal for legal sufficiency prior to the appeal hearing. If the notice of appeal is filed by any other aggrieved person the city commission will review the application for appeal for legal sufficiency prior to the appeal hearing. If the application for appeal appears to lack legal sufficiency, the city commission may request that additional information be filed, in writing, in the form of a brief or other formal statement, or may allow for formal testimony under oath, and, based upon the application for appeal and such other information that is provided in the record, the city commission may affirm the order to be reviewed if it finds that the appeal lacks legal sufficiency. If the city commission finds that the application for appeal meets legal sufficiency, it shall set the appeal for a public hearing in the manner prescribed in section 28-59(a), (b). 
(3)  An appeal shall stay all administrative proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed until such time as a final determination has been made by the city commission on such appeal, and no action shall be taken by the applicant or the planning and building department during such time which would change the status of the matter being appealed. 
(4)  An appeal hearing before the city commission shall be scheduled at the next reasonably available city commission meeting. The hearing shall be based on the record below and no new evidence or testimony shall be considered unless the appellant requests a modification to the action under appeal. If a modification is requested, the only new evidence and testimony allowed shall be limited to the modification. 
(5)  The city commission shall find whether in its opinion error was made and within the terms of this section affirm, reverse or modify the action appealed as it deems just and equitable. If the applicant presents modifications to the action under appeal, the city commission may accept the modification and so modify the order, may remand the appeal back to the board for further review, or may deny the modification and affirm the action appealed. 
(6)  The decision of the city commission shall be the final administrative action, and appeals from the decision of the city commission shall be appealed to the circuit court.

(10)  Designate historical landmarks. As utilized herein the term "historical landmark" shall mean a building, object, site, or structure of the highest historical, architectural, cultural, or archaeological importance and whose demolition, removal, relocation, or alteration would constitute an irreplaceable loss to the character and quality of the city. In the event the historic architectural review board desires not to issue a demolition permit for a structure that is not fifty (50) years old, or older, the historic architectural review board shall initiate proceedings for designation of the structure as an historic landmark. In the designation of an historical landmark, the historic architectural review board shall evaluate the subject property using criteria and standards established by the National Register of Historical Places substituting the importance of the resource to the city and state rather than the nation as a whole. No property shall be designated as an historic landmark without first providing the owner of the proposed historic landmark with notice and an opportunity to be heard in the same manner as that provided for a rezoning of property. Any determination of the historic architectural review board shall be subject to appeal by any affected person to the city commission without any fee being charged or levied.

The board shall establish such record in a sufficient degree to disclose the factual basis for its final determination with respect to such requests and appeals. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or if absent or failing to vote indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its official actions, all of which shall be a public record and filed immediately in the planning and building department and preserved with the city clerk.

Sec. 28-89. - Criteria for certificate of appropriateness or demolition review. 
    The criteria for certificate of appropriateness review shall be as follows: 
(1)  In reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the board and/or building official and/or planning director shall consider the design and appearance of the structure, including the interior visible from the outside, front, sides, rear and roof; materials, textures and colors; plat plan or site layout, including features such as walls, walks, terraces, plantings, accessory structures, signs, lights, awnings, canopies, and other appurtenances. The decision to issue or not to issue the certificate shall be based on the conformance of the proposed work to the Architectural Guidelines for Historical Preservation of the City of St. Augustine as from time to time promulgated by the historic architectural review board or the city commission and approved by ordinance of the city commission, hereinafter referred to as 'AGHP,' and Albert Manucy's Houses of St. Augustine - 1565-1821. When reviewing a certificate of relocation of a structure, consideration will be given to the immediate surroundings and to the district or districts in which it is located or to be located. The board shall not exercise any control over land use, such as governed by this chapter, or over construction, such as is governed by the building code, unless such control is within the intent and scope of this chapter. 
(2)  Before approving the plans for any proposed structure or signs located or to be located in a district, the board shall find: 
a.  In the case of a proposed alteration or addition to an existing structure, that such alteration or addition will not materially impair the architectural or historic value of the structure. 
b.  In the case of a proposed new structure, that such structure will not, in itself or by reason of its location on the site, materially impair the architectural or historic value of a structure on adjacent sites or in the immediate vicinity. 
c.  In the case of a proposed new structure, that such structure will not be injurious to the general visual character of the district or districts in which it is to be located. 
d.  In the case of the proposed demolition of an existing structure, that the removal of such structure will not be detrimental to the historic and architectural character of the city or that, balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity of the city and interest of the owner of the property, approval of the plans for demolition in the latter event the board may issue an order to postponing demolition for a period of not to exceed twelve (12) months after which the owner must reapply. The board may issue a second postponement with the total postponement period not to exceed two (2) twelve (12) month periods. If the board concludes that the demolition should be postponed, it shall, before issuing any final order with respect to such postponement, afford the applicant an opportunity to appear before the board to offer any evidence he may desire to present concerning the proposed order. Within the period of postponement, the board shall ascertain what the city or other agency or organization may do to preserve such structure and shall make recommendations to that effect to the city commission or otherwise cause the structure to be preserved. This section shall not apply to any permit for demolition which has been applied for, in proper form, prior to the effective date of this section. If the building or structure is of exceptional significance, is a contributing property to a National Register of Historic Places District or has been individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the board can deny the demolition if the board finds the removal of such building or structure will be detrimental to the historic and architectural character of the city and the applicant has not proven the denial will cause an undue economic hardship. The destruction of colonial buildings listed on the Florida Master Site File, designated Local Landmarks, or buildings meeting the criteria for eligibility on the National Register of Historic Places must be approved by the city commission. 
Additional application requirements: 
1.  The owner shall permit access to the subject property for the purpose of inspections and/or appraisals required by the board or preservation officer. 
2.  Signs required.

4.  Applications for a certificate of demolition shall be presented to the historic architectural review board by the property owner. 
5.  As a condition of issuing a certificate of demolition, the board may require the replacement design be approved by the board and that no permit be issued for the demolition of said structure until drawings sufficient for a building permit and all necessary requirements for the construction of a new building have been submitted for the new construction. 
6.  As a condition of issuing a certificate of demolition, the board may require, at the applicant's expense, salvage and preservation of significant building materials, architectural details and ornaments, fixtures, and the like for reuse in restoration of other historic properties.

Sec. 28-90. - Administration and records. 
(a)  Any necessary building or demolition permit and/or certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless the building official and/or the planning director and/or the historic architectural review board approves the application for a certificate of appropriateness. Such permit shall be subject to the terms of such approval as well as other necessary provisions of this Code. 
(b)  Applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be submitted through the office of the building official and/or planning director and shall include, in duplicate, all plans, elevations and other information necessary to determine the appropriateness of the features to be passed upon. 
(c)  Prior to issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness required by the board, the board shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be materially affected by the application and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. The board shall hold a public hearing concerning each application. 
(d)  Every decision of the board and/or building official and/or planning director in passing upon plans for structures or signs located or to be located in the district shall be in the form of a written order stating the finding of the board, its decisions and reasons therefor. 
(e)  The board shall not disapprove any plans without giving its recommendations for changes necessary to be made before the plans will be reconsidered. Such recommendations may be general in scope, and compliance with them shall qualify the plans for reconsideration by the board. 
(f)  An appeal may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, be taken by any aggrieved person to the city commission from the board's action in granting or denying a certificate of appropriateness or demolition. The appeal shall be as prescribed in section 28-29(g). Any appeal from the decision of the city commission shall be heard by the circuit court of the county, on writ of certiorari, as in the case of any other zoning decision from the city commission. All orders to approve certificates of demolition shall become effective on the 31 st day following the date of the rendered order, unless this waiting period is specifically granted a written waiver by the city commission or city manager. The owner-applicant of an order to approve a demolition certificate may request a hardship waiver to the city manager for emergency humanitarian reasons including the health and safety of the occupants of a structure in need of immediate emergency repairs, renovation or reconstruction. In the alternative, the owner-applicant of an order to approve a demolition certificate may request a waiver from the city commission if the delay in demolishing the structure would create an undue burden on the owner-applicant that would be greater than the public interest served in preserving the thirty-day waiting period. All decisions to grant or deny the waiver shall be rendered in writing within five days of the decision, mailed by standard U.S. mail to the owner-applicant and posted on the city's website. The decision of the city manager or city commission shall serve as the final administrative appeal of the waiting period. 
(g)  Any decision of the historic architectural review board certified by the planning director to be in conflict with a determination or decision of the planning and zoning board or of the board of adjustments and appeals; shall be reviewed by the city commission in the same manner as an appeal and the commission shall review the determination of the historic architectural review board, and the decision of the planning and zoning board or board of adjustments and appeals as to which it is certified to be in conflict and shall determine whether the decision of the historic architectural review board should be affirmed, modified or reversed and the decision of the commission shall supersede the decision reviewed. All affected persons shall be notified of the hearing by the city commission in the same manner as that provided for appeals from decisions of the planning and zoning board. The hearing before the commission shall be de novo.

Sec. 28-91. - Enforcement. 
    Enforcement of this division shall be as follows: 
(1)  Neither the owner of nor the person in charge of a structure of exceptional significance or within an historic district shall permit such structure to fall into a state of disrepair which may result in the deterioration of exterior appurtenance or architectural feature so as to produce or tend to produce, in the judgment of the historic architectural review board, a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole or the life and character of the structure in question. 
(2)  A stop work order shall be issued by the building official in any case where work has commenced or preparation for work has commenced, if no certificate of appropriateness has been obtained where one is required by section 28-90. The stop work order shall be issued to the owner, the occupant, or any person commencing work or preparation for work in violation of this division. The stop work order shall remain in full force and effect until a certificate of appropriateness has been obtained or it has been determined by the board that no certificate of appropriateness is required. 
(3)  Any person who violates any provision of this division shall be punished as provided by section 28-35. 
(4)  Any person who files with the board and/or building official and/or planning director any application or request for a certificate of appropriateness and who refuses to furnish, upon demand by the board and/or building official and/or planning director, any information relating to such application or request, or who willfully makes any false statement in such application or request, or who, upon such demand, willfully furnishes false information to the board and/or building official and/or planning director shall be punished as provided by section 28-35. 
(Code 1964, § 33-192; Ord. No. 05-22, § 4, 8-8-05)

(2)  The owner of the property described in the certificate of demolition may request an administrative six-month extension from the planning and building director. The request for administrative extension must be filed in writing with the planning and building department during regular office hours no later than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the certificate of demolition. The administrative extension is a ministerial act and shall be available for one extension only. 
(3)  In the alternative, the owner of the property described in the certificate of demolition may request a one-year extension from the board. The request for board extension must be filed in writing with the planning and building department during regular office hours no later than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the certificate of demolition. The application for board extension shall be heard at the next available board meeting. A board extension cannot be applied for property that has already been granted an administrative extension. 
(4)  If the property owner has received either an administrative extension or a board extension of time on a certificate of demolition, the property is not eligible for further consecutive extensions and upon the expiration of the extension the property owner must reapply for a certificate of demolition.

DIVISION 8. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT: PUD 

Sec. 28-286. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) zoning district is to provide an option, and process for the provision of unique, individually planned developments that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the categories outlined in the Comprehensive Plan, but may allow for more creative, flexible, and innovative designs for projects than the regular zoning districts allow. The PUD process is a voluntary process initiated by an applicant to provide flexibility for their project, while at the same time providing an opportunity for the city planning and zoning board (PZB) and city commission to integrate potential benefits, limitations and regulations as it deems necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
    The PUD process is designed to: 
(a)  Promote more efficient and economic uses of land, including bypassed lands, land ripe for urban infill, and potential redevelopment projects; 
(b)  Encourage a more compatible and harmonious development of contiguous lands; 
(c)  Provide flexibility to meet changing needs, technologies, economics, and consumer preferences; 
(d)  Provide a process to assess a development's impact on the proposed site, the surrounding neighborhoods or areas, and the city as a whole; 
(e)  Demonstrate the coordinating of architectural styles, building forms, and building relationships within a planned development, as well as, the planned developments relationship with the existing and preferred architectural context surrounding the project; 
(f)  Provide an environment of consistent character compatible with the surrounding areas; and, 
(g)  Permit specific limitations and requirements in excess of those included in other zoning districts, based on the unique characteristics of the individual site, where necessary to the public health, safety, or welfare, or for the protection or preservation of lands, neighborhoods or areas of the city deemed unique or historic based on the proposed location of the planned development. 
    The intent of a planned unit development (PUD) is to permit this flexibility from the strict application of traditional zoning district regulations by identifying each waiver, variance or exception to such regulation and providing an alternative development condition for that specific PUD. A PUD is a zoning category that can be beneficially utilized in order to create site-specific regulations to address specific development or topographic conditions, historic or architectural features, existing structures, neighborhood patterns or transitioning uses of land. PUDs may be created as in-fill development or redevelopment, or may be developed as traditional residential subdivisions of vacant land. The regulations found in this section may be generally applicable to all PUDs, while others, such as section 28-291, are intended for traditional residential or mixed use subdivisions of vacant land. Amendments to existing PUDs shall comply with the same requirements as found herein for PUD rezoning. 
(Code 1964, § 33-70; Ord. No. 05-37, § 1, 12-12-05; Ord. No. 13-08, § 1, 5-13-13; Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 2-8-16) 
Sec. 28-287. - Defined. 
    A planned unit development (PUD) shall mean the zoning district for the development of a particular parcel of land under unified control which is planned and developed as a whole in a single or programmed series of operations and conditions, with uses and structures substantially related to the character of the entire development. A PUD, established pursuant to ordinance of the city commission, must also include an attached final development plan, and project narrative with specified development conditions and a program for the provision, maintenance and operation of all areas, improvements, facilities and necessary services for the common use of all occupants thereof. As a zoning district, the terms and conditions of a PUD shall be enforceable in the same manner as enforcement of all other city code provisions. All city rules, codes and regulations shall remain in full force and effect, and shall apply to the PUD unless a specific exemption, waiver or alternative condition is included in the approved PUD text and site development plan. 
(Code 1964, § 33-71; Ord. No. 05-37, § 1, 12-12-05; Ord. No. 2013-08, § 1, 5-13-13; Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 2-8-16) 
Sec. 28-288. - Permissible uses. 
    Any use which is permitted by the comprehensive plan may be included and approved in a PUD. Those uses allowed may be allowed in a PUD, but must be specifically identified in the PUD development narrative text, and must be compatible with the property's identified comprehensive plan future land use designation. Such uses approved in conjunction with a PUD must provide a justification for the requested use and include defined development criteria in the PUD to mitigate any potential negative impacts of the uses. Additionally, certain desired benefits to the community must be outlined. The benefits to the community may include, but are not limited to those provided on-site, but benefits related to the proposed planned development off-site as well, such as, public parking provisions, enhanced landscaping or street tree planting, architectural or historic preservation benefits, benefits of certain uses in certain areas and/or alternative transportation benefits, and maintenance, improvement or encouragement of public access to waterways, conservation areas and/or vistas and scenic opportunities. 
(Code 1964, § 33-72; Ord. No. 05-37, § 1, 12-12-05; Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 2-8-16) 
Sec. 28-289. - Procedures, application requirements and narrative PUD text. 
(a)  Application for rezoning to PUD. Each application shall identify and address applicable criteria to its specific plan of development. An application for rezoning to PUD shall proceed in general as for other applications for rezoning of land; and, in addition to the information usually required for such applications, the following shall be required: 
(1)  Plats, surveys, and metes and bounds description of the area within the PUD.

b.  Provide a written narrative PUD text that clearly identifies by corresponding numbered and lettered paragraphs responses to the following criteria: 
1.  Consistency with every relevant goal, policy and objective of the Comprehensive Plan, including but not limited to density and intensity limitations of the Future Land Use Map category for the property; and, 
2.  For properties currently in the HP-1, HP-2, HP-3, HP-4 and HP-5 districts requesting rezoning to PUD, identification of the specific proposed benefits or enhancements to the property that promote the goals of these historic districts; and, 
3.  The need and justification for a rezoning to PUD or PUD amendment, including identification of each proposed development condition that would otherwise not be allowed under the existing zoning, including, but not limited to, maximum lot coverage, signage, setbacks, allowable zoning uses and uses by exception; and, 
4.  Compliance with the purpose and intent and criteria in section 28-286; and, 
5.  Compliance with section 28-288 and justification for any zoning uses; and, 
6.  The phasing of the PUD or PUD amendment, including all sub-phases; each phase addressing the types of approval required or obtained (i.e.: entry corridor, HARB, building plan, landscaping, etc.) and the proposed commencement and completion of such development according to the plans approved by such ordinance or other related permit; and, 
7.  Identification of the legally responsible entity or entities for continuing operations and maintenance to such areas, functions and facilities as are not to be provided, operated or maintained by the city pursuant to written agreement; and, 
8.  A termination date after which the PZB shall be required to evaluate whether all or part of the PUD has been abandoned by failure to timely commence and complete development of all or part of the phases of the PUD as identified pursuant to subsection (6) or other circumstances have contributed to the development delay, if so, one (1) year extension(s) may be granted by the PZB at an advertised public hearing, after two (2) such extensions if no activity has been initiated the city commission shall deem the PUD abandoned which shall act as a reversion of the zoning to its pre-PUD zoning district for the areas not in compliance with the phasing schedule; and, 
9.  If a reversion to pre-PUD zoning district pursuant to subsection (8) would otherwise be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan in effect at the time of the reversion, said reversion shall not become effective unless a Comprehensive Plan amendment is duly adopted; and, 
10.  An infrastructure impact analysis or equivalent impact analysis to clearly outline the project's potential impact on transportation networks, circulation patterns, and infrastructure of the city; and 
11.  A signed statement voluntarily acknowledging and binding the applicant(s), property owner(s), and each of their successors in title, to every commitment made in their application and at hearing relating to the rights, terms, conditions and limitations of the PUD text narrative and final site development plan, including but not limited to the phasing, termination and reversion clauses. 
(b)  Materials to accompany applications. An application for rezoning to PUD shall be accompanied by the following, in sufficient copies as deemed necessary by the planning and zoning board for referrals and recommendations. The planning and building department will maintain a checklist of materials to accompany an application to help clarify the submittal requirements: 
(1)  Plans, maps, studies and reports, including an infrastructure impact analysis, as may reasonably be required by the city commission and the planning and zoning board in order to make the findings and determinations called for in the particular case. The infrastructure impact analysis shall include site specific design improvements related to traffic circulation, and the movement of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles on and off-site, and water, sewer, stormwater improvements, and public utility improvements and impacts. 
(2)  For proposed PUDs currently zoned HP-1, HP-2, HP-3, HP-4 and HP-5, a streetscape demonstrating the size and scale of the project in context with the adjacent properties and existing historic district development patterns. The streetscape shall include at a minimum the subject block and facing block to illustrate how the proposed project meets the scale of the surrounding context. This streetscape requirement is not mandatory for projects that create no visual impact to the exterior of an existing structure. Structural changes in roof lines, exterior facades and elevations and any exterior additions or reconfigurations may require a streetscape, as deemed necessary by staff or the historic architectural review board concurrent with project details. 
(3)  Infill and redevelopment projects shall also be required to provide a streetscape analysis similar to that required in the historic districts as per (b) (2) above, as deemed necessary by staff to allow the PZB and/or HARB, for projects in the city's entry corridors, to evaluate the projects impact on the neighborhood or area, as a defined community in section 28-289(b) (9) and the projects ability to contribute to and enhance the existing streetscape. 
(4)  A written PUD text narrative compliant with all parts of sections 28-286 through 28-292, as applicable. Such PUD text narrative shall also include as an exhibit a final site development plan at an appropriate scale and consistent with the terms of the PUD text narrative, an introductory statement explaining the intended plan of development, clearly indicating where approval of the rezoning to PUD or PUD amendment will benefit the future occupants of the proposed development, will be compatible with the adjacent neighborhood, and will forward the goals, policies and objectives of the city in general, and including any specific benefits to the community as a whole. Such justification shall be based on the intent of the PUD, consistency with the Comprehensive Plan, and compliance with all requirements of rezoning to PUD or PUD amendment as found herein. 
(5)  The final site development plan included at an appropriate scale supporting the above statement illustrating: 
a.  The location, grouping and height of all uses and facilities. 
b.  In the case of residential development, the number of residential units, their location and number of stories. 
c.  A multi-modal circulation system including any vehicular, public transit, pedestrian and bicycle access points, driveways, walkways or crosswalks, parking areas, transit shelters or bus stop loading areas, bicycle racks, and rights-of-way, streets or sidewalks to be dedicated in support of the infrastructure impact analysis. 
d.  A system of open space and recreational uses, with the acreage to be dedicated and that to be retained in common ownership. 
e.  A topographic map at an appropriate scale showing contour lines, including all existing buildings and wooded areas. 
f.  An illustration, outline or discussion describing any community benefits incorporated into the planned development or provided off-site, such as, public parking, enhanced landscaping or street trees, public park facilities, architectural or historic resource benefits, the encouragement of beneficial uses or alternative forms of transportation, maintenance, improvement or encouraging public access to waterways, conservation areas and/or vistas and scenic opportunities. 
g.  Elevations, specific architectural elements, and contextual drawings, as deemed necessary by staff and the PZB and/or HARB to illustrate the details of the project, which may include a sun, shadow or shade study. 
h.  Full signage and hardscape plans, as well as, landscape and tree preservation or replacement plans in sufficient detail to allow PZB to review and make a recommendation concerning the project. 
i.  The site plan must describe and show any buffers or setbacks required from any jurisdictional areas for review to include details for conservation overlay zone development, as well as, locations of any proposed docks or water features, and/or impacts to existing tree canopy areas. 
(6)  Statements indicating how the problems of maintenance and ownership of common facilities will be resolved. 
(7)  A schedule of development, including the staging and phasing of: 
a.  Areas to be developed, in order of priority; 
b.  The construction of streets, utilities and other improvements necessary to serve the proposed development; and 
c.  The dedication of land to public use, if any. 
(8)  Each of the above elements shall be listed as to their relative order of improvement with an estimated time schedule for their accomplishment. It is, among other things, the intent of this requirement that the schedule of development be such that a staged implementation of the PUD would not result in land use conditions which would establish a precedent for the use of adjoining undeveloped property for purposes other than that shown on the approved PUD. 
(9)  Developer neighborhood notice. At the time of filing a PUD or PUD amendment application, the applicant must submit to the city's planning department a copy of the developer neighborhood notice mailed to the Neighborhood Council of St. Augustine, Inc., or its successor, by regular U.S. mail at the current mailing address provided to the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, as made available on that agency's website. If the property is not included in a defined neighborhood area the boundaries of a "community" area will be defined as those properties within a five hundred-foot radius of the project boundaries to be notified by mail postmarked no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the first scheduled PZB meeting, and shall be notified individually by the same neighborhood notice process below. The developer neighborhood notice shall include the following information: 
a.  The project name, property owner(s) and applicant(s); and 
b.  The existing zoning and requested rezoning, the physical address or location of the project, and a brief description of the application request; and 
c.  The developer's project coordinator contact information, including name, mailing address, telephone number and email address; and 
d.  The following statement in prominent font: 
"Please contact the developer's project coordinator directly if a courtesy neighborhood informational meeting is requested of the developer. The courtesy neighborhood informational meeting will be presented by the developer, not by City staff. It is not an official City meeting or hearing on the project application. The developer neighborhood notice is not intended to be a legal notice, nor should it be relied upon to provide affected party status or standing. The developer neighborhood notice is an additional, courtesy informational tool provided to the public to facilitate early, voluntary and direct communication between the City's neighborhoods or defined communities and PUD development applicants. This document was prepared by the developer and the City does not warrant its accuracy. The official complete application public record will be available for review after filing at the City of St. Augustine Planning and Building Department, 75 King Street, St. Augustine, Florida, during regular office hours." 
e.  In addition to the developer neighborhood notice, the city planning and building department may provide additional courtesy information regarding pending applications to individuals and organizations that request it or as part of the city's public information outreach initiative. Such additional courtesy information may be provided in person, by U.S. regular mail, electronic mail or posting on the city's website, as reasonably practicable. This additional courtesy information is not intended to be a legal notice, nor should it be relied upon to provide affected party status or standing. 
(c)  Action by the planning and zoning board and the city commission. Following the public hearing as required for all applications for rezoning, the planning and zoning board may recommend and the city commission may enact an ordinance establishing a PUD, including any special conditions related thereto, based upon findings that: 
(1)  No adverse effect finding. The proposed PUD does not adversely affect the orderly development of the city, the health and safety of residents in the area, the natural environment, the use and development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood. 
(2)  Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan and PUD regulations finding. The proposed PUD is consistent with the comprehensive plan and meets the intent and criteria of sections 28-286 through 28-292, as applicable. 
(3)  Need and justification finding. In order to permit the use of more flexible land use regulations and the most advantageous techniques of land development, the PUD must affirmatively comply with each applicable PUD regulation found in this section and clearly identify the need and justification for rezoning to PUD. The objective of a PUD is to encourage ingenuity, imagination and design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site planners and developers to produce residential, commercial, industrial or institutional developments, or combinations thereof, that effectively integrate existing historic and neighborhood patterns, or effectively transition between adjacent development uses. 
(4)  Site-specific conditions and mitigation finding. The site-specific development conditions for the proposed PUD: 
a.  Permit a creative approach to the development of land; and 
b.  Accomplish a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of the existing zoning district requirements; and 
c.  Provide for an efficient use of land; and 
d.  Improves the appearance of the area through the preservation and enhancement of historic and natural features, recreation areas and open space, and effectively transition from existing development patterns to the PUD; and 
e.  Provide an environment of consistent character compatible with surrounding areas; and 
f.  Retain property values over the years. 
(d)  A PUD or PUD amendment shall first be reviewed by the planning and zoning board, followed by the historic and architectural review board if such review is required. The city commission may remand a PUD application for further review by its planning and zoning board or historic architectural review board, such review shall be limited to the scope of review as expressed by the city commission. The city commission may expressly limit the additional review to only one such agency, after which the PUD application shall be promptly scheduled for further action by the city commission. Nothing in these regulations is intended to remove the historic and architectural review board's reviewing authority after a property has been rezoned to PUD. 
(e)  Deviations from ordinance creating PUD. In order to facilitate minor adjustments to the plans approved as part of the ordinance creating a PUD, the city commission may approve changes in such plans, without the review and recommendation of the PZB, and without the adoption of an ordinance to modify the PUD ordinance, if as a result of such changes: 
(1)  There are the same or fewer number of dwelling units and/or floor area; 
(2)  The open space is in the same general location and in the same general amount, or a greater amount; 
(3)  The buildings have the same or less number of stories and/or floor area; and 
(4)  The roads and drives follow approximately the same course and have the same public or private rights therein. 
(f)  Given the scale and complicated nature of PUDs the PZB shall require review of a planned unit development final development plan, and narrative requirements with at least two (2) public hearing(s) in an effort to garner as much information and public input as possible, as well as, to finalize any recommendations to the city commission. The PZB reserves the right to require only one (1) public hearing, if deemed appropriate by the PZB, the project may move straight to the city commission for rezoning. 
(g)  Because of the nature of PUD's with regard to potential size and the level of detail required of projects, and unless a longer time shall be agreed upon by the applicant and the board in the particular case, a public hearing shall be held by the board to consider any application for a PUD rezoning within not more than sixty (60) days from the date of filing of the complete application. Any revisions or amendment to the PUD rezoning application must be submitted to the planning and building department at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled meeting date. Notice of public hearing shall be made as provided in section 28-59(a) and (b). 
(h)  Expiration of time limits provided in ordinance creating a PUD. If development actions required by the ordinance creating a PUD are not taken within the timeline established in the PUD from the date of approval by the city commission actions consistent with section 28-289 (a)(4)b.8. shall be taken.

Sec. 28-290. - Implementation of a PUD. 
(a)  Development plan. The final development plan, and project narrative shall be attached to the PUD ordinance as an exhibit and shall be the only development plan associated with the PUD unless and until an amendment to the PUD is pursued via amendment to the PUD ordinance or via minor amendment procedures. 
(b)  Record plats. If the PUD ordinance requires the recording of record plats, such plats shall be submitted to the city commission for final approval. 
(c)  Approval of development plans. The planning and building department shall review all development plans; and, if found in compliance with this Code, and the PUD ordinance shall approve same. 
(d)  Permits required. All construction in the development of a PUD shall proceed only under applicable permits issued by the planning and building department; and no building permit, certificate or other document authorizing construction or occupancy within a PUD shall be issued, except in accordance with the approved PUD ordinance and all regulatory provisions in existence at the time of the permit except as otherwise exempted or waived in the PUD text.

(9)  Mixed Use PUD subdivisions. A subdivision PUD that also includes a mixed use component shall also provide a description of the potential other uses allowed besides residential single family uses. This description shall provide enough information to evaluate its proposed consistency with the Comprehensive Plan, potential benefits to the overall PUD community, and the neighborhoods outside of the PUD community, the types of uses proposed, such as, multifamily units, commercial, civic or other uses, and establish the parameters of how these uses are integrated into the development plan. 
(Code 1964, § 33-75; Ord. No. 05-37, § 1, 12-12-05; Ord. No. 2013-08, § 1, 5-13-13; Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 2-8-16) 
Sec. 28-292. - Standards and criteria for redevelopment and infill PUD developments. 
    The following performance standards are intended for redevelopment and infill PUD developments. These projects typically involve property currently developed where the proposed PUD includes razing the existing development and building new or renovating the existing development to the extent that it is a redevelopment project which introduces new uses or combination of uses and a new design changing the character of the existing. Infill projects typically involve vacant property within an existing developed area where it is important for the proposed PUD to be compatible with the existing surrounding development. These standards and criteria are in addition to other PUD requirements outlined above. 
(1)  General development patterns. Redevelopment and infill projects within the city shall take into consideration pedestrian oriented design, the human scale and sense of place of the surrounding area, and shall respect existing development patterns and provide for compatibility, quality and integrity of the existing area and neighborhoods. They should provide a unique sense of place through architectural design and a mixture of compatible uses in a compact setting with sensitivity to the context of the surrounding neighborhood. The PUD should be an addition to the area and neighborhood which contributes to the area and increases the value of the surrounding area. 
(2)  Contributions to the existing community. Redevelopment and infill projects shall also demonstrate consideration for the existing neighborhoods and street patterns within the city by describing the project's impact on existing community patterns, the environment, the economy, the transportation networks or circulation patterns as described in an infrastructure impact analysis, as well as, natural features, and vistas and scenic opportunities. The project narrative shall include a statement of how the PUD is consistent with the character, history, and cultural and natural features that help create a sense of place. The project shall be compatible by demonstrating appropriate design, massing, screening, and architectural techniques. 
(3)  Redevelopment and infill PUD projects. Additionally, redevelopment and infill projects shall include a description evaluating the existing building(s) condition, potential demolition issues, and the extent of renovation of the existing building(s), if applicable. A clear description of the site design evaluating existing issues, such as, access, driveways, parking, maneuverability, landscaping, including tree removal is also required if necessary.

DIVISION 10. - SUBURBAN PLANNED DEVELOPMENT: SPD 

Sec. 28-320. - Intent. 
(a)  The purpose of the Suburban Planned Development (SPD) is to allow for special uses and design. The application of flexible land use controls to the development of land is often difficult or impossible within traditional zoning district regulations. In order to permit the use of more flexible land use regulations and to facilitate use of the most advantageous techniques of land development, it is necessary to establish Suburban Planned Developments (SPD) in which development is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this division, with the city's general planning program and such Comprehensive Plans as may from time to time be adopted by the city commission. The objective of the SPD is to encourage ingenuity, imagination and design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site planners and developers, to produce developments which are in keeping with the overall land use intensity and open space objectives of the zoning ordinance. The intent of this part is to permit flexibility, and provide performance criteria for Suburban Planned Developments which: 
(1)  Permit a specific and creative approach to the development of land; and 
(2)  Provide for an efficient use of land; and 
(3)  Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation; and 
(4)  Provide an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding areas; and 
(5)  Retain property values over the years. 
(b)  SPD Defined. 
(1)  For the purposes of this division, a Suburban Planned Development (SPD) shall mean the development of land of a minimum size of ten (10) acres under unified control which is planned and developed as a whole in a single or programmed series of operations with specific uses and structures substantially related to the character of the entire development. 
(2)  Permissible uses. Any use, or combination of uses, which is permitted or permissible by exception in any existing defined zoning classification may be included and approved in SPD, by a specific reference and approval of that use in the ordinance creating such SPD. 
(Ord. No. 97-36, § 1, 11-24-97) 
Sec. 28-321. - Procedures. 
(a)  Application for rezoning to SPD. An application for rezoning to SPD shall proceed in general as for other applications for rezoning, and in addition to the information usually required for such applications, the following shall be required: 
(1)  Plats and/or metes and bounds description of the area within the SPD. 
(2)  The name and address of the owner, and if applicable, evidence of the assignment of an agent who represents the owner. 
(3)  Evidence of unified control of the entire area within the SPD with all owners within the area of same identified. 
(4)  An agreement by all owners within the SPD which includes their commitment to: 
a.  Proceed with the proposed development in accordance with the adopted SPD and such conditions and safeguards as may be set by the city commission in such ordinance; and 
b.  Produce a written statement of a proposal for completion of such development according to plans approved by such ordinance; and for continuing operation and maintenance of such area, functions, and facilities; and 
c.  To bind their successors in title to any commitments made in the application. 
(b)  Materials to accompany petition. An application for the rezoning to SPD shall be accompanied by the following in sufficient copies as deemed necessary by the planning and zoning board, unless waived by such board, for referrals and recommendations: 
(1)  Plans, maps, studies and reports, as may reasonably be required by the city commission and the planning and zoning board in order to make the finding and determinations called for in the particular case; and 
(2)  A written description of the intended plan of development clearly indicating where approval of the SPD will benefit the future occupants of the proposed development and the City of St. Augustine in general. (Such justification shall be based on the objectives of section 28-320); and 
(3)  A design plan at an appropriate scale supporting the above statement illustrating: 
a.  The location, grouping and height of all uses and facilities. 
b.  In the case of residential development, the number of residential units proposed, their general location and number of stories. 
c.  A detailed vehicular and pedestrian circulation system including driveways, walkways and parking area, including a definition of the class of roads to be constructed and whether such roads to be constructed and whether such roads are to be public or private. If roads are proposed to be private, the proposed provision for maintenance is to be provided. 
(4)  A statement as to the specific zoning classification sought as to the defined permitted uses and the permitted uses by exception to be authorized within the SPD. 
(5)  A written description of the specific uses for which each structure within the SPD can be used and schedule of development, including the phasing of areas to be developed and specific time limit for development which is not to exceed two (2) years for commencement of construction following final approval by the city commission and ten (10) years for completion from such final approval. 
(c)  Action by the planning and zoning board and city commission. Following the public hearings as required for all applications for rezoning, the planning and zoning board may recommend and the city commission may enact an ordinance establishing an SPD, including any special conditions related thereto, based upon findings that: 
(1)  The proposed SPD does not affect adversely the orderly development of the city as embodied in this zoning code and in any comprehensive plan or portion thereof adopted by the city commission. 
(2)  The proposed SPD will not affect adversely the health and safety of residents or workers in the area and will not be detrimental to the natural environment or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood. 
(3)  The proposed SPD will accomplish the objectives and standards and criteria of section 28-322(b) of this Code. 
(d)  Minor adjustments to ordinance creating an SPD. In order to facilitate minor adjustments to SPD ordinances or to the plans approved as part of the ordinance creating an SPD, the planning and zoning board may approve minor adjustments in such ordinance. Minor adjustments shall be those changes or adjustments that comply with the following criteria: 
(1)  There is no increase in the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area is not increased by more than ten (10) percent; and 
(2)  The open space is in the same general location and in the same general amount, or a greater amount; and 
(3)  There is no increase in the number of stories within buildings; and 
(4)  The roads and drives follow approximately the same course, have the same or greater width, have the same public or private rights therein; and 
(5)  The land uses remain the same; and 
(6)  Vehicular access points are in the same general location. 
    Extension of time limits for development or other actions required under an SPD shall be considered minor adjustments if the city planning director determines that there has been no significant change in circumstances since the effective date of the ordinance that created the SPD; provided, however, that the chief building official may grant no more than two (2) ninety day extensions for the commencement of construction in the same manner as provided in section 28-29(f) of this Code. 
    No formal notice provisions are required to consider and/or approve minor adjustments except when there are owners within 150 feet of a proposed minor modification which affects the setback, height or location already approved to SPD's, other than the developer of the total lands involved, the minor modification shall proceed with adjacent property owner notification and notice of publication as prescribed by section 28-300 of this Code. 
(e)  Minor adjustments to vary from the minimum yard requirements, minimum lot area or width, maximum building height, maximum building coverage, and minimum building separation shall be subject to the standards for variances under this Code. Such applications shall proceed and be processed in the same manner as standard variance applications and notice requirements of this Code for land not located in an SPD. 
(f)  Major adjustments to ordinance creating an SPD. The developer of lands zoned SPD may apply for major adjustments to the plans approved as part of the ordinance creating an SPD, and such application shall proceed and be processed in the same manner as standard rezoning applications. 
(g)  Expiration of time limits provided in ordinance creating an SPD. If development permitted by the ordinance creating an SPD is not commenced and completed within the time limits set by the city commission in such ordinance, then the property shall remain zoned SPD but no further construction or development shall be permitted on the property after the expiration of the time limit until and unless the property has been rezoned, or the time limits under the existing SPD have been modified or extended, or the existing SPD has been rezoned to a different SPD. At any time after one year from the effective date of the lands zoned SPD or the owners of the majority of the land within the SPD, may apply for such rezoning or extension of time limits and such application shall proceed and be processed in the same manner as standard rezoning applications except that in addition to the normally required mailed notices, notices shall also be mailed to all other owners of property within the SPD. In the event the ordinance creating the SPD specifically provided that the property shall revert automatically to a defined zoning district category upon failure to commence defined development actions within specified time limits, the reverter provision shall apply and the property shall automatically be rezoned in the manner and to the zoning provided in said ordinance. 
    If no specific time limits are set by the city commission in the ordinance creating the SPD, the time limit for commencing or completing improvements under that SPD shall be as set forth in section 28-321 (b)(5). 
(h)  Extensions of time limits for development or other actions required under an SPD that are made prior to one year from the effective date of the ordinance creating the SPD may be made by the planning and zoning board without published notice provided that such board determines that such time extensions are not detrimental to the community. 
(Ord. No. 97-36, § 1, 11-24-97) 
Sec. 28-322. - Implementation of an SPD. 
(a)  Permits required. All construction in the development of an SPD shall proceed only under applicable permits issued by the planning and building department following (i) the submittal of a final development plan to the planning and zoning board and issuance of a final development order by such board upon its finding that the final development plan is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and the SPD ordinance as passed by the city commission, and (ii) recordation of the plat upon approval by the city commission and, if applicable, covenants and restrictions necessary for the maintenance of common areas; and, no building permit, certificate or other document authorizing construction or occupancy within an SPD shall be issued, except in accordance with the approved SPD ordinance.

ARTICLE V. - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES SITING ORDINANCE 

Sec. 28-400. - Title. 
    This article may be known and cited as the "Wireless Telecommunications Facilities Siting Ordinance for the City of St. Augustine." 
(Ord. No. 09-08, § 1, 3-9-09) 
Sec. 28-401. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, and where not inconsistent with the context of a particular section, the defined terms, phrases, words, abbreviations and their derivations shall have the meanings given in this section. When not inconsistent with the context, words in the present tense include the future tense, words used in the plural number include words in the singular number and words in the singular number include the plural number. The word 'shall' is always mandatory and not merely directory. 
    Other definitions as provided in chapter 28 of this Code shall supplement and apply to the provisions of this Ordinance. In the event of any conflict, the definitions as provided in this Ordinance shall prevail. 
    Adverse visual impact means the negative visual effect of a wireless telecommunications facility on its surroundings. Being able to see a wireless telecommunications facility does not necessarily equate to a negative visual effect. Whether the visual effect of a wireless telecommunications facility is adverse is based on the existence of relevant negative factors for that facility, the number of those negative factors and the degree that the facility evidences those negative factors. Relevant negative factors may include: a large amount of the wireless telecommunications facility is visible from normal views; the wireless telecommunications facility is of a design, material, location, or size that readily catches and holds a viewer's eye when viewed from normal views; the wireless telecommunications facility is in the normal view of a person in a moving vehicle for more than a short period of time; the wireless telecommunications facility is to be lighted and in an area with few or no other lights; the wireless telecommunications facility is readily identifiable as a wireless telecommunications facility by the average viewer; the wireless telecommunications facility, when viewed from normal views, appears out of place in the area; there is an absence of existing visual impact from other uses in the area surrounding the wireless telecommunications facility; there is an absence of vegetation, structures or other screening between the wireless telecommunications facility and normal views; the scale (height and bulk) of the wireless telecommunications facility is significantly greater than other uses existing or allowed in the surrounding area; the facility is proposed in an area visually protected by adopted view protection corridors or generally applicable aesthetic regulations that heighten the protection of the overall aesthetics of the area; and a large amount of the available view is occupied by the wireless telecommunications facility, relative to all available views. 
    Antenna means a whip (omni-directional antenna), panel (directional antenna), disc (parabolic antenna) or similar device used for transmission and/or reception of radio frequency signals. Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used in this article, the term "antenna" also means "antenna array." 
    Antenna array means one (1) or more whips, panels, discs, or similar devices used for the transmission or reception of radio frequency signals, which may include omni-directional antennas (whips), directional antennas (panels), and parabolic antennas (discs). 
    Cellular means a mobile telephone service operating in the eight hundred (800) MHZ spectrum. 
    Close-mount means antenna arrays mounted within three (3) feet of the mounting structure. 
    Collocation means the use of the same telecommunications tower or structure to carry or support two (2) or more antennae for the provision of wireless services by two (2) or more persons or entities. 
    Concealed wireless telecommunications facility means a wireless telecommunications facility that is not readily identifiable as such and that is not aesthetically incompatible with nearby uses. There are two (2) types of concealed wireless telecommunications facilities: 
(1)  Concealed wireless telecommunications facility tower means a style of wireless telecommunications facility tower designed to obscure from view the antennas and the ancillary appurtenances that directly relate to the antennas. Concealed wireless telecommunications facility towers include, but are not limited to, structures that are or look like the following: a church steeple, a bell tower, spire, clock tower, cupola, light standard, flagpole with or without a flag, tree, etc. 
(2)  Concealed wireless telecommunications facility antenna means antenna either located wholly within the structure so as not to be visible, located behind screening, or otherwise locating them in such a manner that the antenna and ancillary appurtenances are not readily identifiable as such. 
    Fall zone means the area on the ground within a prescribed radius from the base of a wireless telecommunications facility. The fall zone is the area within which there might be a potential hazard from falling debris or collapsing material. 
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC) means an independent federal agency charged with licensing and regulating wireless communications at the national level. 
    Guyed tower means a type of mount that is anchored to the ground or to another surface by diagonal cables. 
    Height AGL (above ground level) means the distance measured from ground level to the highest point of a wireless telecommunications facility broadcast including the antenna array. For purposes of measuring height, all antennas, lightning rods or other attachments mounted on a structure shall be included in the measurements to determine overall (i.e. combined) height. 
    Historic resource or historic property means any historic district, site, building, object or other real or personal property that has been officially designated as being of historical, architectural or archaeological value through a federal, state or local designation program. These properties or resources may include, but are not limited to: Historic preservation districts as designated by this Code, monuments, memorials, Indian habitations, ceremonial sites, abandoned settlements, sunken or abandoned watercraft, engineering works, treasure troves, artifacts or other objects or features with intrinsic historical or archaeological value, or any part thereof, relating to the history, government, and culture of the state and the city. 
    Lattice tower means a type of wireless telecommunications facility which consists of multiple legs and cross-bracing of structural steel. 
    Monopole means one (1) type of self-supporting tower consisting of a single shaft of wood, steel or concrete and antennas at the top and/or along the shaft. 
    Nonconforming structure means any building or structure, other than a sign, that was legally established but no longer complies with the standards of these land development regulations or the comprehensive plan. 
    Personal communication services (PCS) means mobile telephone service operating in the 1900 MHZ spectrum. 
    Scenic corridor means a visual opening along a traveled route, such as a road, waterway, bike path or pedestrian trail that has been officially designated through a federal, state or local designation program. 
    Special use permit means the official document or permit by which an applicant is allowed to construct and use wireless telecommunications facilities as granted or issued by the city. 
    Tower means a structure constructed for the primary purpose of supporting antennas and other wireless telecommunications facility components. 
    Wireless services means any personal wireless service defined in the Federal Telecommunications Act which includes Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed commercial wireless telecommunications services including cellular, personal communications services (PCS), specialized mobile radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR), paging as well as unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services. 
    Wireless telecommunications facilities or telecommunications site means a structure, facility or location designed, or intended to be used or used to provide wireless services. The placement of a wireless telecommunications facility on an existing structure, however, does not cause the existing structure necessarily to become a wireless telecommunications facility.
