PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete reproduction of the ordinances of the City of East Peoria, Illinois, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through July 7, 1994 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    Each section number consists of three parts. The first figure refers to the title number, the second figure refers to the chapter number, and the last figure refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Title 1, Chapter 1, is numbered 1-1-2, and the first section of Title 4, Chapter 3, is numbered 4-3-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its title and chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1-1 and 3-1-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. New articles and new divisions may also be included using the decimal system, or new divisions or articles may be placed at the end of the title or chapter embracing the subject, with the next successive number being assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

1-8-4.14. - Reserved. 
1-8-5. - INVESTMENT POLICY 
1-8-5.1. - Policy. 
    It is the policy of the City of East Peoria to invest public funds in a manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city and conforming to all state statutes governing the investment of public funds. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00) 
State Law reference- 30 ILCS 235/2.5. 
1-8-5.2. - Scope. 
    This investment policy applies to all general operating funds of the city. These funds include all current operating funds and any other funds which may be created from time to time, and does not include specified funds regulated by other provisions of state or federal law. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00) 
1-8-5.3. - Standard of care. 
    The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard, and this standard shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00) 
1-8-5.4. - Objective. 
    The primary objective, in order of priority, of investment activity shall be: 
(a)  Safety of principal. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investment of city assets shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to insure the preservation of capital in the portfolio. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, and shall be mitigated by: 
(1)  Limiting investments to the safest types of securities backed by the U.S. Government either directly or indirectly; and 
(2)  Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on individual securities or investments will be minimized. 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates, and shall be mitigated by: 
(1)  Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to majority; 
(2)  Investing operation funds primarily in short-term securities; and 
(3)  Limiting all investments to a defined and stated maturity of not more than five (5) years. 
(b)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands. Furthermore, because all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets, or investment instruments which offer same-day liquidity. 
(c)  Return on investments. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of least importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investments are limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity unless liquidity needs of the city require that the security be sold. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00) 
1-8-5.5. - Delegation of authority. 
    The establishment of an investment policy is the responsibility of the City of East Peoria Mayor and Council. Management and administrative responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to the treasurer who is under the direction of the mayor and city council. The treasurer shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate investment and financial activities and subordinate officials. The system of controls shall be written and shall include procedures which explicitly set forth the delegation of authority to responsible persons for specific financial transactions and which are designed to prevent losses of funds that might arise from fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees or officials. The treasurer may from time to time amend the written procedures in a manner not inconsistent with this policy or state statutes. No person may engage in any investment transaction except as provided for under the terms of this policy. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00; Ord. No. 4276 , § 7, 4-19-16)

(a)  Bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, treasury bills or other securities now or hereafter issued by the United States of America, its agencies and allowable instrumentalities; 
(b)  Interest-bearing savings accounts, interest-bearing certificates of deposit or interest-bearing time deposits, or any other investments constituting direct obligations of any bank as defined by the Illinois Banking Act (investments may be made only in those savings banks or savings and loan associations, the shares or investment certificates of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation); 
(c)  Certificates of deposit with federally insured institutions that are collateralized or insured at levels acceptable to the city in excess of the one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit; 
(d)  The Illinois Public Treasurer's Investment Pool; and 
(e)  Any other instrument specifically authorized under the Illinois Public Funds Investment Act. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00) 
1-8-5.7. - Collateralization. 
    City funds on deposit in excess of FDIC insurable limits must be secured by collateral or private insurance to protect public deposits in a single financial institution if the institution were to default. Collateral must be placed in safekeeping at or before the time when the city buys an investment in a manner clearly demonstrating that the purchase of the investment is predicated on the securing of the collateral. Third party safekeeping is required for all collateral and shall be documented by an approved written agreement between the city and a financial institution which complies with all state and federal (including FDIC) regulations. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00) 
1-8-5.8. - Authorized financial institutions, advisors, and managers. 
    The treasurer shall maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services for the city and to handle city funds. Additionally, the treasurer shall maintain a list of financial advisors and money managers. In order to be placed on these lists, the financial institution, financial advisor, or money manager must be approved based upon credit worthiness, meeting state and federal laws and regulations, and ability to provide necessary services or investment types for the city. 
(Ord. No. 3199, § 1, 1-4-00; Ord. No. 4276 , § 7, 4-19-16) 
1-8-5.9. - Diversification. 
    The city's investments shall be diversified within the practical considerations which reflect the types of funds being invested, the amount of funds, the purpose of the funds, and the cash flow needs of the funds.

(a)  The disclosure officer will review and make comments on the first draft of the official statement prepared by the working group. The disclosure officer shall be responsible for ensuring that all descriptions relating to the city are accurate and that any significant information regarding the city, including but not limited to demographic changes, loss of major employers, the addition or loss of major taxpayers or any other material information, is included and properly disclosed. The disclosure officer shall also be responsible for ensuring that the financial data presented with regard to the city is accurate and corresponds with the financial information in the city's possession, including but not limited to, information regarding bonded indebtedness, notes, certificates, outstanding leases, tax rates or any other financial information of the city presented in the official statement.

The disclosure officer shall also review the financial statements to be filed as part of the annual financial information. In addition to the required updating of the annual financial information, the disclosure officer should consider whether additional information needs to be added to the annual financial information in order to make the annual financial information, including the financial statements, taken as a whole, correct and complete in all material respects. For example, if disclosure of events that occurred subsequent to the date of the financial statements would be necessary in order to clarify, enhance or correct information presented in the financial statements, in order to make the annual financial information, taken as a whole, correct and complete in all material respects, disclosure of such subsequent events should be made. 
(b)  If, in the disclosure officer's opinion, the annual financial information, including the financial statements, is correct and complete in all material respects, the disclosure officer shall file the annual financial information with EMMA (or confirm that such filing is completed by any agent acting on behalf of the city for such purpose) within the timeframe allowed for such filing. If the mayor, any commissioner or any other officer or agent of the city informs the disclosure officer of any material information included in the annual financial information that should be corrected or any additional material information that should be included in the annual financial information, the disclosure officer shall file an amended EMMA notice with EMMA. 
(Ord. No. 4185, § 1, 8-19-14) 
1-8-7.5. - Disclosure procedures: EMMA notices. 
    Whenever the disclosure officer has notice of information that must be disclosed in an EMMA notice, or whenever the city decides to make a voluntary filing to EMMA, the disclosure officer will oversee the process of drafting the EMMA notice pursuant to these procedures: 
(a)  The disclosure officer shall draft, or oversee the drafting of, the EMMA notice. The EMMA notice shall be drafted in the form required by the MSRB. 
(b)  The disclosure officer shall determine whether any changes to the EMMA notice are necessary to make the document compliant with the undertaking. 
(c)  If, in the disclosure officer's opinion, the EMMA notice complies with the undertaking and is correct and complete, the disclosure officer shall file the EMMA notice with EMMA (or confirm that such filing is completed by any agent acting on behalf of the city for such purpose) within the timeframe allowed for such filing. If the EMMA notice is filed and the mayor, any commissioner or any other agent of the city informs the disclosure officer of any material information included in the EMMA notice that should be corrected or any additional material information that should be included in the EMMA notice, the disclosure officer shall file an amended EMMA notice with EMMA. 
(Ord. No. 4185, § 1, 8-19-14) 
1-8-7.6. - Additional responsibilities of the disclosure officer. 
    The disclosure officer, in addition to the specific responsibilities outlined above, shall have general oversight of the entire disclosure process, which shall include:

    Notwithstanding the responsibilities of the disclosure officer under this section, the mayor and commissioners retain responsibility to review the disclosure prior to release and to inform the disclosure officer if such person is aware of any information that should be corrected or included in such disclosure. 
(Ord. No. 4185, § 1, 8-19-14) 
1-8-7.8. - General principles. 
(a)  All participants in the disclosure process should be encouraged to raise potential disclosure items at all times in the process. 
(b)  The process of revising and updating the disclosures should not be viewed as a mechanical insertion of current numbers. While it is not anticipated that there will be major changes in the form and content of the disclosures at the time of each update, the disclosure officer should consider the need for revisions in the form and content of the sections for which he or she is responsible at the time of each update. 
(c)  Whenever an issuer releases information, whether in written or spoken form, that may reasonably be expected to reach investors, it is said to be "speaking to the market." The disclosure officer and the council should endeavor to be sure that, when speaking to the market, the released information does not make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary or desirable, in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. 
(d)  While care should be taken not to shortcut or eliminate any steps outlined in the disclosure policy on an ad hoc basis, the review and maintenance of the disclosures is a fluid process and recommendations for improvement of the disclosure procedures should be solicited and regularly considered.

Every application shall be investigated by the local liquor control commission to its satisfaction, and it shall, within a reasonable time, either approve or reject said application. Upon the approval of such application and the certificate of bond specified in section 3-3-1.9, and upon the payment of the license fee in the amount specified in section 3-3-1.5, the local liquor control commissioner shall designate written approval and direct the city clerk to issue a license or a subclass license to such license applicant.

The local liquor control commission shall also have the right to require the applicant to answer any charges made in any objection to the issuance of the license by the liquor control commissioner, chief of police, or the city attorney. The failure of any applicant to appear at the time and place fixed by the local liquor control commission for his examination or to produce books and records requested, unless for good cause shown, shall be deemed to be an admission that the applicant is not qualified to receive a license. 
(c)  The building inspector, fire chief and police chief or their respective designees may at any reasonable time inspect the licensed premises for compliance with applicable provisions of the East Peoria City Code. 
(d)  Applications for licenses or subclass licenses shall be considered in the order in which they are presented to the local liquor control commission.

(e)  At any time when a business conducted by a manager designates a new or additional manager, the new or additional manager must submit an application for approval to the city on the forms designated. Said application shall be accompanied by an investigation fee in the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00). Said person shall not perform the duties of manager until approval has been received from the city.

Any such purchaser shall make application for the issuance of a new license to him, and in such application he shall state the actual facts in respect to his purchase of such business. He shall also fill out an application blank and furnish the information and make those statements required of any other licensee under section 3-3-1.7. Such application shall be investigated and approved or rejected as in the case of applications for original licenses, and, if approved, the license shall be issued to such purchaser upon payment to the city clerk of the license fee then due, without any credit for any unused portion of the previous license, and there shall be no rebate to any person for any unused portion of any license. No license shall be issued to the purchaser of such business until the seller of such business shall have surrendered his license to the city clerk for cancellation. 
(Ord. No. 3614, § 4, 6-21-05) 
3-3-1.18. - Renewal. 
(a)  Any licensee may renew his license prior to the expiration thereof; provided, that he is then qualified to receive a license, and the premises for which such renewal license is sought are suitable for the purpose; provided further, that the renewal privilege herein contained shall not be construed as a vested right which shall in any case prevent the city council from decreasing the number of licenses to be issued within the city. 
(b)  All applications for the renewal of a liquor license shall be made in writing to the local liquor control commission prior to the date of expiration of said license. It shall not be necessary for the full license application to be filed semi-annually or annually (as applicable) in order to obtain a renewal of the license; provided, that the applicant shall submit an affidavit stating that the information and statements contained in the original application have not changed, and such affidavit shall be accompanied by the required license fee. 
(c)  Any person who shall fail to make application for renewal and pay the fee as herein provided shall be deemed to have forfeited and abandoned such license, and no renewal thereof shall thereafter be permitted. Any such license so forfeited or abandoned shall not be reissued, and any such person seeking thereafter to procure a license shall be considered as a new applicant and shall be subject to all limitations as to the number of licenses to be issued, as heretofore provided. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the local liquor control commission to renew a license when the total number of licenses outstanding in a particular license classification exceeds those permitted by this chapter.

(d)  Tenant defined. Every person who has a possessory interest in but is not an owner of a dwelling unit of a multifamily apartment house, a dwelling unit of a two-family dwelling or a one-family dwelling.

(1)  In each sleeping room of every boarding house.

(h)  Exception for areas protected by automatic sprinklers. The fire chief may waive the requirement for the installation of a smoke detector pursuant to this section 4-1-7 if he first determines that the area where a smoke detector would be required by this section is adequately protected by an automatic sprinkler system. 
(i)  Moratorium on imposition of fines authorized. The city council may, in its discretion, authorize by resolution a moratorium on the imposition of fines for violation of the requirements imposed by this section 4-1-7. The enactment of a moratorium on the imposition of fines for violation of this section shall not be construed to eliminate or diminish the responsibility imposed upon owners and tenants pursuant to this section. The existence of such a moratorium is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded and proved by the alleged violator in order to avoid the imposition of a fine.

Except as otherwise provided in this Code, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move, or convert any sign or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a sign permit as required by this Code.

The square footage for an individual letter sign shall be the copy area.

(e)  Issuance and denial. The director shall grant or deny a permit for the erection, alteration, or relocation of a sign within five (5) working days of receipt of a valid and complete application including the paid fee, provided the proposed sign complies with all applicable laws and regulations of the city. When a matter of interpretation arises, the more specific definition or higher standard shall prevail. 
    When the permit is denied by the director, written notice of the denial with the reasons shall be forwarded to the applicant. 
    The director may, in writing, suspend or revoke an issued permit for any false statement or misrepresentation of fact in the application or if the sign is not placed according to the site plan submitted. 
    No permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be deemed to constitute permission or authorization to maintain an unlawful sign or shall any permit issued hereunder constitute a defense in an action to abate an unlawful sign. 
(f)  Permit conditions and penalties. A permit issued by the director becomes null and void if work does not commence within sixty (60) days of issuance. If work authorized by the permit is suspended or abandoned for thirty (30) days, the permit must be renewed with an additional payment of one-half of the original fee. 
    If any sign is installed or placed on any property prior to receipt of a permit, the specified permit fee shall be tripled. However, payment of the tripled fee shall not relieve any person of any other requirements or penalties prescribed in this chapter. 
    If an electrical permit is not obtained prior to installing electricity to a sign, then the director shall stop the installation activity of the sign and the permit fee shall be tripled. If the director suspends or revokes an issued permit for reason, then the re-issued fee will be tripled. 
(g)  Inspections. Any person installing, altering or relocating a sign for which a permit has been issued shall notify the director upon completion of the work. A freestanding sign shall be inspected after the post hole(s) has been dug and prior to the erection of the pole and sign.

Notice of the time and place of the hearing together with a brief description of the subject matter shall be published one (1) time not more than thirty (30), nor less than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. Variations from the regulations of this title shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals only in accordance with the standards established in this section, and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no others: 
(a)  To permit a setback of less than ten (10) feet from the property line; 
(b)  To permit an increase in the height of a sign of not more than forty (40) percent of the maximum permitted under the applicable regulation; and 
(c)  To permit an increase in the area of a wall or freestanding sign of not more than twenty-five (25) percent of the maximum permitted under the applicable regulation. 
(2)  Standards for variations. The zoning board of appeals shall not vary the regulations of this Sign Code, as authorized in this section, unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(a)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out; 
(b)  The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification; 
(c)  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property; 
(d)  The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this Code and has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the property; 
(e)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and 
(f)  The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the public street, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
The zoning board of appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this section, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of this title. 
The same application for a variance may not be resubmitted within six (6) months of the zoning board of appeals' decision unless in the judgment of the administrator the original application has been substantially amended. 
(i)  Bond and certificate of insurance. No permit for a sign being installed by a sign company shall be issued to any person for the purpose of erecting an authorized sign unless the company has on file with the city a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The bond is conditioned upon the proper installation of the sign and payment of all fees and/or penalties as implemented by this Code. A company that is engaged in the business of signs shall provide to the city a certificate of insurance for liability in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per person, three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) per occurrence and one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for property damage. 
(j)  Interpretation. Whenever the requirements of this Code fail to apply to a unique situation, or a situation arises which is not covered by this Code, the administrator shall have the authority to interpret the Code, provided no sign shall be permitted which does not meet the intent and purpose of this Code.

Illinois Department of Natural Resource Office of Water Resources has jurisdiction over any stream serving a tributary area of six hundred forty (640) acres or more in an urban area, or in the floodway of any stream serving a tributary area of six thousand four hundred (6,400) acres or more in a rural area. Construction on these streams requires a permit from the department. (Ill Admin. Code tit. 17, pt. 3700.30). The department may grant approval for specific types of activities by issuance of a statewide permit which meets the standards defined in section 4-13-6 of this chapter. 
    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor. Provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of section 4-13-7 of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home. A structure transportable in one (1) or more sections, that is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more lots for rent or sale. 
    New construction. Structures for which the start of construction commenced or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements of such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed or buildings to be constructed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

    Repetitive loss. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    SFHA. See definition of floodplain. 
    Start of construction. Includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a substantial improvement, actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure (see "Building" ). 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cumulative percentage of damage subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance codified herein equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must be included in this determination. The term includes "repetitive loss buildings" (see definition). 
    Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a structure taking place subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance codified herein in which the cumulative percentage of improvements: 
a.  Equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started, or 
b.  Increases the floor area by more than twenty (20) percent. 
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done. The term does not, however, include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.

(7)  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(b)  The director shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of section 4-13-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will: 
(1)  Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; 
(2)  Increase the risks to life and property; and 
(3)  Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and liability. 
(c)  Variances to the building protection requirements of section 4-13-7 of this chapter requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in section 4-13-2 of this chapter may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of sections 4-13-6 and 4-13-7 of this chapter, subject to the conditions that: 
(1)  The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure; and 
(2)  Repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being removed as a certified historic structure. 
(d)  Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided individually based on a case-by-case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter. In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed: 
(1)  All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures. 
(2)  Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). 
(3)  For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with section 4-13-7 of this chapter. 
(4)  The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with section 4-13-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
(5)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 4-13-7 of this chapter. 
(6)  The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with subsection 4-13-7(b) of this chapter. 
(7)  The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway provisions of section 4-13-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures within any designated floodway. 
(8)  Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction. 
(Ord. No. 3493, § 1, 2-24-04; Ord. No. 4326 , § 1, 1-31-17) 
4-13-11. - Disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 3493, § 1, 2-24-04) 
4-13-12. - Penalty. 
    Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the director may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The director shall notify the owner in writing of such violation. 
(a)  If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the violation: 
(1)  The city may make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter; 
(2)  Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof be fined not less than fifty ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense; 
(3)  A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues; and 
(4)  The city shall record a notice of violation on the title to the property. 
(b)  The director shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. The director is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit. No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: 
(1)  The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation; and 
(2)  The time and place of the hearing. 
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the zoning board of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. 
(d)  All costs connected with any enforcement activity, including reasonable attorney's and engineering fees incurred by the city therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible for violating the standards established in this chapter.

4-13-13. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. However, this chapter does not repeal the original chapter adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinances, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 3493, § 1, 2-24-04) 
4-13-14. - Severability. 
    The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and the invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the remainder. 
(Ord. No. 3493, § 1, 2-24-04; Ord. No. 4326 , § 1, 1-31-17) 
4-13-15. - Carrying capacity and notification. 
    For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained.

4-14-16. - Termination of authority. 
    The authority of all persons to maintain a utility line on right-of-way, whether installed before or after the enactment of this chapter, shall expire on October 15, 2003 or on the fifteenth anniversary of the permit authorizing installation of the utility line, whichever is later. Upon termination of authority to maintain a utility line in the right-of-way by expiration or otherwise, the owner of the utility line shall, without cost or expense to the city, remove the utility line and restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially the same as existed prior to removal, all under the supervision of the director. 
4-14-17. - Removal of utility lines by city. 
    In the event that the owner of the utility line fails, neglects or refuses to remove or relocate a utility line required to be removed or relocated under the provisions of this chapter, the city may either perform the work and charge the cost thereof to the owner or pursue any other remedies provided by law. 
4-14-18. - Revocation of permit. 
    The authority of any utility company or other person to maintain a utility line on the right-of-way may be revoked or terminated by the city if the owner fails or neglects to comply with any provision of this chapter within thirty (30) days following written notification from the director to the owner of the utility line.

5-4-10. - Site plan review. 
(a)  Uses for which site plan is required. In order to minimize adverse effects of any proposed development upon existing uses, to clarify the concept of a proposed development when seeking local building and zoning approvals, and to better conserve and enhance the visual environment of the community, the expansion or initiation of any permitted use or special use in all zoning districts shall not be permitted without administrative site plan review and approval by the director of planning and development. 
(b)  Site plan submittal requirements. Site plans submitted for site plan review to the director of planning and development shall be drawn to the following scales and include the following data: 
(1)  A scale of not smaller than one inch equals fifty feet (1? = 50') for areas of fifteen (15) acres or less or where the longest dimension does not exceed eight hundred (800) feet for all larger projects, one inch equals one hundred feet (1? = 100'). Plan shall show date, north point and scale. 
(2)  Property lines of the subject and abutting properties. 
(3)  Location of existing and proposed structures, drives and parking areas on the subject property and existing structures within one hundred (100) feet of the subject property.

(5)  In business and industrial zoning districts, such landscape treatment, landscape screening and fencing sufficient to accurately represent the concept of the proposed project, including appearance from fronting roads as well as appropriate screening treatments. Landscape screening, when utilized, shall follow the guidelines for screening and landscaping found in sections 5-4-11 of this title. 
(6)  In all zoning districts, any building having a side wall with street frontage shall be constructed so that any such side wall having street frontage does not have a sheet metal exterior surface, but instead has an exterior surface constructed of acceptable materials. Acceptable materials shall include EIFIS, stone, brick composite siding, vinyl siding or other durable exterior materials appropriate for exterior applications. No building permit for any such building shall be issued until the exterior design of the building has been approved by the zoning administrator. Once the exterior design has been so approved, the building shall be constructed in accordance with the approved design. 
(7)  Names and addresses of the architect, engineer, landscape architect, planner or designer responsible for the site plan. 
(c)  Review of site plan. The review of such site plans by the director of planning and development shall consider: 
(1)  Location of drives, access and egress points to public streets, including recommendations of the director of planning and development. 
(2)  Traffic circulation and location of building, parking, loading, and storage areas within the site so as to assure the use of the site creates minimum adverse effects on bounding streets and properties. 
(3)  Less attractive or possible nuisance uses to be accommodated on the site which might require landscape screening or fencing from surrounding properties or bounding roads. The director of planning and development may require relocation of such uses to areas of the site so as to have less adverse visual or nuisance impact on surrounding properties or bounding roads. 
(d)  Director of planning and development action; applicant's petition to city council. Following his review, the director of planning and development shall by action approve or disapprove the issuance of a zoning permit as to the site review conditions stated herein, and shall notify the applicant and the planning and zoning administrator of his actions including, if disapproved, the reasons for disapproval. If approved, the zoning administrator shall issue the necessary permits providing the proposed structure or use is otherwise in compliance with the regulations of the city. 
    If the director of planning and development disapproves the project or approves the project with conditions to which the applicant is not agreeable, the applicant may petition to the city council for review of the project. The city council may concur or reverse the action of the director of planning and development by a simple majority vote but shall take no action without receiving a written report from the director of planning and development of his findings and action unless such report is not received within forty-five (45) days of his action on the matter. 
    Site plans upon which issuance of zoning permits have been based after site plan review shall be filed in the department of planning and development office. Substantial variance from that site plan without concurrence of the director of planning and development in carrying forth the proposed project shall be deemed to be a violation of this title, subject to the penalties prescribed herein. 
(Ord. 1881, 8-21-82; Ord. 2461, 9-25-90; Ord. No. 3651, § 2, 11-1-05; Ord. No. 4317 , § 2, 2-7-17) 
5-4-11. - Screening and landscaping. 
(a)  Applicability. The landscaping requirements set forth in this section 5-4-11 shall apply in the R-4 multi-family dwelling district, in all business and manufacturing districts and in one- or two-family dwelling districts where the zoning lot is used for some purpose other than a one- or two-family dwelling. All landscape plans are subject to review, comment, and, where appropriate, modification by the zoning administrator. 
(b)  Performance standards. All landscape plans shall fully meet the following performance standards in order to receive approval from the zoning administrator: 
(1)  Landscaping shall not hinder the vision of motorists and pedestrians necessary for safe movement into, out of, and within the site. 
(2)  Landscaping materials shall be selected and placed in such a manner that they do not interfere with or damage existing utilities. 
(3)  Landscaping materials shall be selected and placed so that the safe and enjoyable use of surrounding properties is not inhibited. 
(4)  Landscaping shall be selected and placed with a sensitivity toward the ultimate size that will be achieved over time through growth of vegetation. 
(5)  Landscaping with thorns, berries, and other unsuitable characteristics shall be carefully placed to avoid potential harm to people or property on and off site. 
(6)  Weak wooded trees shall only be used only where other species are unavailable. 
(c)  Calculation of minimum requirements. 
(1)  The amount of landscaping required shall be calculated by utilizing the point system hereinafter described. An owner may elect to create a landscape design through the alternative compliance provisions described in subsection (j) of this section 5-4-11. Landscaping utilizing the point system of this section 5-4-11 shall be based on formulas hereinafter set forth. The requirements for a given zoning lot shall be the total of all equations for front years, transitional buffer yards and parking lots listed under the applicable subsections. In calculating any requirement in this section 5-4-11, a fraction of one-half (1/2) or greater shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
(2)  The following point allocations shall apply for all required landscaping. 
Tree Classification Base Value Shade Tree 18 points Evergreen Tree 18 points Intermediate Tree 12 points  
At the time of planting, shade trees shall have a caliper size of not less than two and one-half (21/2) inches at a point three (3) feet above ground level while single stem intermediate trees shall have a caliper size of not less than one and one-half (11/2) inches at a point two (2) feet above ground level. Multiple stem intermediate trees shall have a minimum height of six (6) feet at the time of planting. 
Shrub Classification Base Value Evergreen Shrubs 3 points Deciduous Shrubs 2 points  
(3)  The number of points calculated by utilizing the point system hereinafter described shall be multiplied by a factor of one and one-half (11/2) for any of the following classes of parcel otherwise subject to the landscaping requirements set forth in this section: 
a.  Any parcel which is located within a scenic area. 
b.  Any parcel with respect to which a special use has been established for so long as the special use continues on that parcel. 
(d)  Front yard landscaping. All developed zoning lots, other than those zoning lots which are located within a one-family or two-family dwelling district and used for single family or two-family dwelling purposes, shall provide front yard landscaping as provided for in this subsection. All yards, such as those in corner lots or irregularly shaped lots, which are adjacent to a street shall meet the landscaping requirements for front yards. (Townhouses and condominiums shall not be considered as one- or two-family dwellings.) 
(1)  The number of points required for landscaping of front yards shall be based on the overall length of the lot frontage as measured in feet along the property line divided by two (2). For example, if the front yard lot frontage of a zoning lot is two hundred twenty (220) feet in length, then the landscaping must generate one hundred and ten (110) points. 
(2)  Not less than forty (40) percent of the points required for landscaping of front yards shall be achieved by utilizing plants from the tree classification. 
(3)  Front yard landscaping shall be planted in the required front yard. If there is additional area between the required front yard and the closest on-site parking lot or building all or some of the required landscaping may be planted within such additional area upon approval by the zoning administrator. 
(e)  Parking lot landscaping. 
(1)  The number of points required for landscaping of a parking lot shall equal the required total number of parking spaces in that lot. The points may be generated through the use of any combination of trees and/or shrubs. The requirements for parking lot landscaping are in addition to any requirements for landscaping in front yards or transitional buffer yards. 
(2)  When a parking lot has less than one hundred (100) parking spaces the landscaping may be placed within interior curbed parking islands and/or within ten (10) feet of the perimeter of the parking lot. 
(3)  When a parking lot has one hundred (100) or more parking spaces, one-half (1/2) of the required points shall consist of shade trees planted in curbed islands within the interior of the parking lot. The intent of this provision is to break up large expanses of pavement and to provide shading by locating shade trees away from the perimeter and within the interior of parking lots. 
a.  Parking lot islands shall be curbed with concrete or a functionally equivalent material that must be approved by the zoning administrator. The following materials are not considered functionally equivalent to concrete curbs and are therefore unacceptable for use as curbs within the city: 
1.  Landscape timbers 
2.  Railroad ties 
3.  Wood/lumber 
4.  Concrete wheel stops 
(4)  The minimum unpaved area for planting all types of trees within parking lots shall not be less than one hundred and sixty (160) square feet per tree. Shade trees and intermediate trees shall not be planted in any area with a width of less than five (5) feet. Evergreen trees shall not be planted in an area with a width of less than ten (10) feet. Shrubs shall not be planted in areas with a width of less than two (2) feet. When plants are proposed to be planted within curbed islands or adjacent to curbs, the width of such planting areas shall be measured from the inside of curbs. The locations of parking lot landscaping will be subject to review and approval by the zoning administrator. 
(f)  Transitional buffer yard requirement and landscaping. All nonresidential zoning lots which abut, or, in the absence of an alley, would abut any residential zoning lot or district shall contain a transitional buffer yard (TBY) unless otherwise provided for in this section. Multifamily zoning lots containing more than two (2) dwelling units which abut, or, in the absence of an alley, would abut any one- or two-family zoning lot or dwelling district shall also contain a TBY. 
(1)  Depth of TBY. The width of a TBY shall be not less than ten (10) percent of the width or depth, whichever is applicable of the lot required to contain a TBY. However, no TBY shall be less than ten (10) feet in width and no TBY shall be required to be more than twenty-five (25) feet in width. the yard depth or width for a yard with varying widths or depths will be measured from the yard's mid-point. 
(2)  Reduction of TBY requirements. In those cases where the one- or two-family residential zoning lot adjoining or across the alley from the subject non-residential or multi family zoning lot has been developed for other than one- or two-family dwelling purposes, the zoning administrator shall have the authority to reduce the TBY requirements. This authority may be exercised when the zoning administrator determines that the proposed reduction will not have a negative impact on the subject residential lot. 
(3)  Dispute resolution. The zoning administrator shall have the final authority to determine the width and location of transitional buffer yards for irregularly shaped parcels, or other parcels when there is a dispute as to the width and location of a TBY. 
(4)  Prohibited materials in TBY. Any TBY required pursuant to this ordinance shall be maintained as a planted or landscaped area only. No driveways, refuse containers, storage, aisleways, vehicular maneuvering area, mechanical equipment, sidewalks, materials (other than landscaping), or structures of any form shall be located within any required TBY. However, if an emergency exit into the TBY area is required by code, a concrete pad of no more than twenty-three (23) square feet may be placed at grade level immediately outside of the required exit. 
(5)  Utility structures. Utility structures may be permitted in a TBY on a case by case basis, but only through the alternative compliance provisions of this section. 
(6)  Determination of required plant materials for transitional buffer yards. 
a.  The minimum number of landscaping points in a TBY shall be based on the overall length of the TBY as measured along the TBY property line. For example, if the property line running the length of the TBY is one hundred and eighty (180) feet long, then one hundred and eighty (180) points must be achieved through landscaping. 
b.  One-half of the total points for TBY landscaping must be evergreen trees or shrubs. 
c.  Not less than forty (40) percent of the points for TBY landscaping shall be achieved by utilizing plants from the tree classification. 
d.  All shade trees in a TBY must be three and one-half (31/2) inches caliper size or larger at a point three (3) feet above ground level. 
(7)  Screening of activity areas. On-site activity areas as described below that are adjacent to a required TBY are required to be visually screened with a fence, wall, berm, evergreen planting or combination thereof which achieves a substantially solid visual barrier with a minimum height of six (6) feet. If a fence or wall is used to meet this requirement it must be located between the activity area and the TBY. This visual barrier shall be required when all or any portion of the subject site that is adjacent to the required TBY is planned or used for the following activities: 
a.  Refuse container/dumpster loading, unloading, or storage; 
b.  Storage or display of materials or merchandise; 
c.  Loading or unloading of passengers or goods; 
d.  Production, assembly, processing, or demolition of goods; 
e.  Temporary or permanent parking of vehicles. 
These requirements shall be in addition to all other landscaping requirements of any type. When plantings are utilized to meet this screening requirement they must be capable of achieving a substantially solid visual barrier within two (2) years from the date of the planting. 
(g)  Incentive for preserving existing landscaping. Existing landscaping that is in a vigorous growing condition and is not specifically prohibited by this ordinance may count toward meeting the point requirements of this ordinance. Furthermore, the following plant materials will be awarded five (5) additional points (added to base value) per tree when preserved. 
Shade Trees 12 inches diameter trunk or greater Intermediate Tree 15 feet height or taller Evergreen Tree 15 feet height or taller  
(h)  Incentive for planting larger landscaping. Planting of landscaping larger than the minimum required sizes specified in this section 5-4-11 will be awarded five (5) additional points (added to base value) per tree when the following heights or caliper sizes are provided: 
Shade Tree 4 inches diameter (5 inches in TBY's) or greater Intermediate Tree 10 feet height or taller Evergreen Tree 10 feet height or taller  
(i)  Ground cover and mulching requirements. 
(1)  Ground cover requirements. All yards shall be planted and maintained with a vegetative ground cover such as sod or seed. Other low growing plants (evergreen or broadleaf evergreen plants with a mature height of one (1) foot or less) may also be utilized. When low growing broadleaf evergreen plants such as pachysandra, vinca minor, and purpleleaf wintercreeper are utilized to meet the ground cover requirements they shall be planted together in continuous beds, mulched with shredded hardwood bark or cypress mulch and spaced in such a way that they achieve a substantially continuous ground cover within two (2) years from the date of planting. Creeping junipers may be mulched with shredded hardwood bark, cypress, or gravel mulch and must meet the same coverage time line as stated for broadleaf evergreen ground covers. 
(2)  Mulching requirements. All required shrubs and trees shall be mulched and maintained with shredded hardwood bark, cypress, or gravel mulch. Plant groups shall be mulched in a continuous bed in which the edge of the mulching bed does not extend any more than four (4) feet beyond the edge of the plantings. When required shrubs or trees are planted individually and away from nearby plants they shall be encircled in a mulched area with a diameter of no more than five (5) feet. Evergreen trees are allowed a mulched circle with a diameter large enough to accommodate the spread of the tree and up to four (4) additional feet of mulch beyond the edge of the tree. All mulch proposed to be placed within or directly adjacent to a parking lot shall be shredded hardwood bark or cypress mulch. Gravel mulch is not permitted within or directly adjacent to parking lots. 
(j)  Alternative compliance. Owners may choose to follow the point system described above or to submit a landscape plan to the zoning administrator under the alternative compliance provisions of this subsection (j). The alternative compliance provisions are intended to give owners the flexibility needed to respond to unique site issues and client needs and still meet the intent of this section 11. 
(1)  No appeal of zoning administrator's decision. If an owner chooses to submit a landscape plan through the alternative compliance procedure, no appeal of the zoning administrator's review decision shall be allowed. Denial by the zoning administrator will require that the owner amend the plan through the alternative compliance process or submit a plan utilizing the standard point system. 
(2)  Basis for review. Landscape plans submitted through the alternative compliance procedure shall fully achieve the performance standards as described in subsection (b) of this section 5-4-11. 
(k)  Replacement of dead landscaping materials. Any landscaping materials required under this section 5-4-11 which for any reason die or fail to thrive shall be replaced with other landscaping materials having an equal point value and similar characteristics as soon as good horticultural practice permits.

CHAPTER 5. - NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS; USES 
SECTION: 

5-5-1. - Continuance of use. 
    Any lawfully established use of a building or land, at the effective date of this Title, or of amendments thereto, that does not conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located, shall be deemed to be a legal nonconforming use and may be continued in use provided there is no physical change other than necessary maintenance and repair, except as otherwise permitted herein. 
5-5-2. - Discontinuance of use. 
(a)  Whenever any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a nonconforming use is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the provisions of this Title, such premises shall not thereafter be used or occupied by any nonconforming use, even though the building may have been originally designed and constructed for the prior nonconforming use. 
(b)  Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or structure, or part thereof, has been discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive months, or for a continuous period of twelve (12) months if the building was originally designed and constructed for a nonresidential use, or whenever there is evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming use, such use shall not after being discontinued or abandoned, be re-established and the use of the premises thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations of the district. 
(c)  Where the use of land without an enclosed building is involved, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of six (6) months shall constitute abandonment. 
(d)  An illegal nonconforming use not authorized by the provisions of the city ordinance in effect at the time this Title becomes effective, shall be discontinued and not re-established, unless the provisions of this Title find the use to be conforming to the district in which it is then located. 
5-5-3. - Change of use. 
    A nonconforming use of a building or structure, or part thereof, may be changed to a use of the same or of a more restricted character, but may not thereafter be changed to any less restricted use. 
(1970 Code) 
5-5-4. - Termination and removal of nonconforming uses. 
    The following nonconforming uses of buildings, structures, or land shall be discontinued and completely removed from the premises and shall not be resumed or maintained at the expiration of two (2) years from the effective date of this amendment or from the effective date of any amendment to this Title which causes said use to hereinafter become nonconforming. 
(a)  Any nonconforming use which is conducted primarily on open land and does not utilize any permanent enclosed building or structure, or where the only buildings or structures employed are accessory or incidental to such use. 
(b)  Any nonconforming building or structure having an assessed valuation not in excess of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) on the effective date of this Title. 
(c)  Any nonconforming sign, billboard or outdoor advertising structure. 
(d)  Any nonconforming junkyard or automobile wrecking yard. 
(Ord. 2213, 9-1-87) 
5-5-5. - Repairs and alterations. 
(a)  Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming use. 
(b)  No structural alterations shall be made in a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use, except in the following situations: 
(1)  When the alteration is required by law. 
(2)  When the alteration will actually result in eliminating the nonconforming use. 
(3)  When a building containing residential nonconforming uses may be altered in any way to improve livability, provided no structural alteration shall be made which would increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building. 
5-5-6. - Damage and destruction. 
    If a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of fifty (50) percent or more of its replacement value at the time, the building or other structure can be rebuilt or used thereafter only for a conforming use in compliance with the provisions of this Title. In the event the damage or destruction is less than fifty (50) percent of its replacement value, based upon prevailing costs, the building may then be restored to its original condition and the occupancy or use of such building may be continued as it existed at the time of such partial destruction. 
    In either event, restoration or repair of the building or other structure must be started within a period of one year and diligently prosecuted to completion. 
5-5-7. - Additions and enlargements: 
(a)  A nonconforming building may be enlarged or extended only if the entire building is thereafter devoted to a conforming use, and is made to conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(b)  No building partially occupied by a nonconforming use shall be altered in such a way as to permit the enlargement or expansion of the space occupied by such nonconforming use. 
(c)  No nonconforming building in any residential district shall be so altered as to increase the number of dwelling units therein. 
(d)  No nonconforming use may be enlarged or extended in such a way as to occupy any open space required by this Title or any land beyond the boundaries of the zoning lot as it existed at the effective date of this Title, or to displace any conforming use in the same building or on the same parcel. 
(1970 Code) 
5-5-8. - Addition, expansion, enlargement of a nonconforming use and reconstruction of a destroyed nonconforming use as a special use. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon nonconforming special use application and hearing, the zoning board of appeals may find the continuance of a nonconforming use not detrimental to the public interest and may recommend the granting of a nonconforming special use to remove restrictions and limitations which would otherwise apply on the expansion, enlargement or reconstruction of said nonconforming use. 
    In granting a nonconforming special use, the zoning board of appeals shall find that the property for which the nonconforming special use is applied meets the conditions as stated in section 5-11-10(f). In addition, the board may recommend, and the city council may require, certain conditions of use, operation or improvement without which, in the opinion of the board and council, the elimination of restrictions on nonconforming uses would not be appropriate in the neighborhood in which the use is located. Failure of the use to meet such conditions in a continuing manner shall be considered a zoning violation, subject to the penalties of this Title. In addition, should it be found that the owner is unwilling to comply with the stipulated conditions under which the nonconforming special use was granted, the use will revert to its initial nonconforming use status with all restrictions and limitations as existing prior to the granting of the nonconforming special use.

(2)  An unpaved residential driveway on the given parcel would be consistent with the character of the neighborhood in which the parcel is located. 
Waiver of the requirement that off-street parking facilities used for residential purposes must be paved does not constitute a waiver of the provisions of section 7-2-10 et seq. of the city Code which require, without limitation, permits for curb cuts and paved aprons and sidewalks on the public right-of-way. No waiver of the requirements imposed by section 7-2-10 et seq. is authorized by this section. 
(f)  The zoning administrator has the authority at his/her discretion to approve the expansion of existing gravel surfaces, as long as, the expansion is not related to the expansion of a primary structure or a garage.

5-10-4. - M-3 Manufacturing district, transitional. 
(a)  Permitted uses. The uses permitted in this district generally include those manufacturing and industrial activities which cannot be operated economically without creating some conditions which may be objectionable or obnoxious to the occupants of adjoining properties and for that reason must be grouped in areas where similar industrial uses are located or where the permitted uses will be best located in accordance with the comprehensive plan of the city which is designed to protect the welfare of the city. It must be recognized, however, that any area subject to this classification also contains properties which for many years have been used for residential purposes. Any transition from residential to manufacturing which ultimately occurs will likely occur over a long period of time. It is in the best interests of the city to encourage residents in the area to maintain their properties in a sound condition for so long as they intend to remain. 
    Therefore, the following uses are hereby permitted, provided, that full compliance with the standards hereinafter set forth shall be established and constantly maintained, and provided further that all such uses, except residential uses, shall be on a minimum lot size of one (1) acre: 
(1)  Any use permitted in the M-2 district.

On any lot where a residential use has been legally established and continues without interruption, the improvement, enlargement or repair of any existing residential structure and/or the construction, improvement, enlargement or repair of accessory buildings shall be permitted. No vacant lot, nor any other lot where a residential use has not been legally established and continued without interruption, shall be used for residential purposes. In the event, however, that fire or other casualty destroys improvements on a lot, which improvements at the time of the loss were owner occupied, and construction of replacement improvements commences within six (6) months, such loss by reason of fire or other casualty shall not for purposes of this section be deemed to have resulted in an interruption of a residential use. 
(b)  No territory containing less than one hundred (100) contiguous acres at the time of a petition to rezone, shall be rezoned M-3 manufacturing district, transitional. 
(c)  Special use. The following uses may be allowed by special use permit in accordance with the provisions of section 5-11-10 of this title: 
(1)  Except for lots used for residential purposes, any use which may be allowed in the M-2 district as a special use. 
(2)  On lots where a residential use has already been legally established and continues without interruption, any use which may be allowed in the R-2 one-family dwelling district as a special use.

(4)  An existing building constructed prior to January 1, 1990 may be remodeled to accommodate not more than six (6) dwelling units together with any one (1) or more of the following nonresidential uses: 
a.  One (1) or more wholesale business establishments and/or warehouses provided that no hazardous items may be sold from or stored on the property. 
b.  One (1) or more artist studios or galleries. 
c.  One (1) or more food preparation and/or packaging facilities. 
d.  One (1) or more retail business establishments. 
(d)  Building height. Regulations applicable to the height of buildings or structures in an M-2 district shall also be applicable to the height of buildings or structures in an M-3 district, except for lots used for existing residential purposes. On lots where a residential use has already been legally established and continues without interruption, building height regulations applicable to R-2 one-family dwelling districts shall apply. The height of an existing structure converted to mixed uses pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section may be increased by not more than ten (10) percent of the height as it existed prior to such conversion. 
(e)  Areas. The coverage, front yard, side yard and rear yard requirements applicable in an M-2 district shall also be applicable in an M-3 district, except for lots used for residential purposes. On lots where a residential use has already been legally established and continues without interruption, regulations dealing with lot size and yard areas applicable to R-2 one-family dwelling districts shall apply. An existing structure converted to a mixed use pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section shall maintain setbacks no less than those existing prior to conversion and shall maintain an area no greater than the area existing prior to conversion. 
(f)  Performance standards. The performance standards applicable in an M-2 district shall also be applicable in an M-3 district except for lots used for residential purposes. On lots where a residential use has already been legally established and continues without interruption, dwelling standards applicable in an R-2 one-family dwelling district shall apply. For an existing structure converted to a mixed use pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section, dwelling standards applicable in the R-4 multiple-family dwelling district shall apply to the dwelling units in such structure and performance standards applicable in the M-1, manufacturing district, limited, shall apply to the nonresidential components of such structure. 
(g)  Dual uses. Except as authorized by special use pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section, no lot may be used both for residential purposes and for either a use automatically permitted in the M-2 district or for one allowed as a special use in an M-2 district. 
(h)  On lots where a residential use has already been legally established and continues without interruption, or where a new residential use has been approved in accordance with this chapter, all minimum housing regulations set forth in title 4, chapter 8 of this Code of the city shall apply.

(2)  The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification; 
(3)  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property; 
(4)  The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this title and has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the property; 
(5)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and

The zoning board of appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this section, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of this title. 
(d)  Authorized variations. Variations from the regulations of this title shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals only in accordance with the standards established in this section, and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no others: 
(1)  To permit any yard or setback less than a yard or a setback required by the applicable regulations;

(3)  To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required facilities for two (2) or more uses; provided that substantial use of such facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days of the week; 
(4)  To reduce the applicable loading facilities required by not more than twenty (20) percent of the applicable regulations, whichever number is greater; 
(5)  To increase by not more than twenty-five (25) percent the maximum distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served; and

An appeal may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person or by any office, department, board or bureau aggrieved by a decision of the zoning administrator or his authorized agent. Such an appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the zoning board of appeals by general rule, by filing with the city clerk a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The city clerk shall forthwith transmit to the zoning board of appeals all of the papers constituting a record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(b)  Findings on appeals. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed unless the zoning administrator certifies to the zoning board of appeals, after notice of the appeal has been filed with the city clerk, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed unless by a restraining order which may be granted by the zoning board of appeals or by a court of record on application of the zoning administrator and on due cause shown. 
(c)  Hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give notice thereof to the parties, and shall render a written decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay. The zoning board of appeals may affirm or may, upon the concurring vote of four (4) members, reverse, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination that, in its opinion, ought to be done; and to that end, shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The zoning administrator shall maintain records of all sections of the zoning board of appeals relative to appeals. 
(1970 Code) 
5-11-9. - Amendments. 
(a)  Authority. For the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, morals, comfort, general welfare; to conserve the value of property throughout the city; and to lessen or avoid congestion in the public streets and highways, the city council may, from time to time, in the manner hereinafter set forth, amend the regulations imposed in the districts created by this title; provided that in all amendatory ordinances adopted under the authority of this section, due allowance shall be made for existing conditions, the conservation of property values, the direction of building development to the best advantages of the entire city and the uses to which property is devoted at the time of the adoption of such amendatory ordinance. 
(b)  Initiation of amendment. Amendments may be proposed by the city council, zoning board of appeals, planning commission or any person having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable. 
(c)  Application for amendment. An application for an amendment shall be obtained from and filed with the zoning administrator in such form and accompanied by such information as required by the zoning board of appeals. 
(d)  Hearing on applications. The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing on each application for an amendment at such time and place as shall be established by the board. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the board shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time. 
(e)  Findings of fact and recommendation of the zoning board of appeals. Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing on a proposed amendment, the zoning board of appeals shall make written findings of fact and shall submit same together with its recommendations to the city council. Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to change the zoning classification of particular property, the board shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case with respect to the following matters: 
(1)  Existing uses of property within the general area of the property in question; 
(2)  The zoning classification of property within the general area of the property in question; 
(3)  The suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted under the existing and proposed classifications; 
(4)  The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property in question, including changes, if any, which have taken place since the date the property in question was placed in its present zoning classification; 
(5)  Minimum size of parcel. A lot, lots or parcel of land shall not qualify for a zoning amendment unless it possesses two hundred (200) feet of frontage or contains twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet of area, or adjoins a lot, lots or parcel of land which bears the same zoning district classification as the proposed amendment. 
(6)  Public interest. The zoning board of appeals shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such amendment is in the public interest and is not solely for the interest of the applicant. The board may recommend the adoption of an amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in question to any other classification than that requested by the applicant. 
(f)  Action by the city council. 
(1)  The city council shall not act upon a proposed amendment to this title until it shall have received a written report and recommendation from the zoning board of appeals on the proposed amendment; said written report and recommendation from the zoning board of appeals shall be submitted to the city council within sixty (60) days after the submission of the proposed amendment to the zoning board of appeals. In the event that the zoning board of appeals fails to submit a written report and recommendation within said sixty (60) day period, the city council may take action on the proposed amendment. 
(2)  If an application for a proposed amendment is not acted upon finally by the city council within three (3) months of the date upon which such application is received by the board, it shall be deemed to have been denied. 
(g)  Simultaneous hearing on special use and/or variation. Whenever an application for a special use and/or a variation is filed in conjunction with an application for a zoning amendment and said applications pertain to the same described property, the zoning board of appeals, after proper public notice, may hold a single public hearing to consider the application for the zoning amendment as well as the application for the special use and/or variation. 
5-11-10. - Special uses. 
(a)  Purpose. The development and execution of this title is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the uses of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two (2) categories: 
(1)  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest; and 
(2)  Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
(b)  Initiation of special use. Any person having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to use land for one or more of the special uses provided for in this title in the zoning district in which the land is located. 
(c)  Application for special use. An application for a special use permit shall be filed with the zoning administrator on a form prescribed by the zoning board of appeals. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data prescribed by the board and shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth in this section. 
(d)  Hearing on application. Upon receipt in proper form of the application and statement referred to in this section, the board shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed special use, not more than thirty (30) days or less than fifteen (15) days in advance of such hearing, notice of time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, as prescribed by applicable state statutes. Supplemental or additional notices may be published or distributed as the board may, by rule, prescribe from time to time. 
(e)  Authorization. For each application for a special use permit, the board shall report to the city council the stipulations or additional conditions and guarantees, that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. The city council may grant or deny any application for a special use; provided, however, that in the event of written protest against any proposed special use, signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty (20) percent of the frontage immediately adjoining the property proposed for a special use, or by owners of twenty (20) percent of the frontage across the alley or directly opposite therefrom, such special use shall not be granted except by a favorable vote of three-fourths of the city council. 
(f)  Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the zoning board of appeals unless such board shall find: 
(1)  That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare; 
(2)  That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood; 
(3)  That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district; 
(4)  That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided; 
(5)  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets; 
(6)  That the special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the city council pursuant to the recommendations of the zoning board of appeals; 
(7)  That where it is found a use not otherwise acceptable to the neighborhood in which located would be acceptable with certain conditions of use operation and improvement, the zoning board of appeals may recommend and the council may require the granting of such nonconforming special use subject to specified conditions. Such conditions may include: 
a.  Landscape screening or fencing. 
b.  Hours of operation. 
c.  Night lighting (including parking areas) so as not to be annoying to surrounding properties. 
d.  Requirements for access lanes and parking areas to protect pedestrian safety. 
e.  Restraint on signage so as to be compatible with surrounding properties. 
f.  Limitation on outdoor storage. 
g.  Where any site plan expansion is proposed. 
h.  Any other such requirements which, in the opinion of the zoning board of appeals or council, would render the use compatible with surrounding properties. 
(g)  Termination of special uses. Any special use authorized by the city council shall be deemed to have automatically terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
(1)  Except with respect to a planned development special use, the failure to establish the special use within one year after authority to establish the special use is granted by the city council. 
(2)  With respect to a planned development special use, the failure to abide by time limits made applicable to such special use by action of the city council or by the city Code. 
(3)  After establishment of a special use, the discontinuation of that use for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months. 
(4)  The violation of any condition, stipulation or agreement placed upon the special use by the city council. In the event that a special use authorized with respect to any parcel of property within the city is discontinued, abandoned or terminated as provided in this section, the only uses which may be established on that parcel are the permitted uses authorized under the zoning regulations applicable to that parcel or any special use authorized by the city council which has not been terminated, discontinued or abandoned in accordance with the provisions of the city Code. 
(h)  Effect of special use permit. Upon the authorization of any special use, including a planned development special use, with respect to a given parcel, any person entitled by any possessory interest to utilize that parcel may establish the authorized special use but only in accordance with any conditions, stipulations or agreements applicable to such special use. In the alternative, any such person may establish with respect to such parcel any permitted use authorized by the zoning regulations applicable to the district in which the parcel is located.

CHAPTER 12. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 
SECTION: 

5-12-1. - Purpose. 
    The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. It is also recognized that new types and procedures in land development or redevelopment are emerging and that the mixing of uses and variations in heights and yards can produce very satisfactory and lasting results if properly designed and planned and designed without adverse influence upon surrounding property. 
(1970 Code) 
5-12-2. - Planned development defined. 
    A planned development is a use of land containing two (2) or more buildings which offer benefits to the neighborhood of which it is a part or to the general public welfare even though it may not conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(1970 Code) 
5-12-3. - Minimum area. 
    No lot having an area of less than five (5) acres shall be eligible for designation as a planned development. The major requirement is that the tract be both self-contained and homogeneous, as well as being improved so as to benefit the entire city with no adverse effect upon the surrounding property. 
(1970 Code; Ord. No. 4141, § 1, 2-18-14) 
5-12-4. - Procedure and application; tentative development plan approval. 
    The applicant shall submit a tentative development plan to the zoning board of appeals for an approval in principle, and the board shall approve prior to the submission of an application for a planned development special use permit. The written consent of all property owners within the development shall be on file with the city before study of a tentative development plan shall be commenced. Approval in principle of the tentative development plan shall be limited to the general acceptability of the land uses proposed and their interrelationships, and shall not be construed to endorse precise location of uses, configuration of parcels or engineering feasibility. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91) 
5-12-5. - Preliminary application for a planned development special use permit. 
    Any person or persons owning land within the city may apply to the zoning administrator for approval of a planned development. The zoning administrator shall refer the preliminary application to the zoning board of appeals for public hearing and report. The board may approve or disapprove the application or make recommendations regarding changes or revisions that it deems desirable. The city council shall study the report and recommendations of the board, and, if the council approves the preliminary application or changes therein, the applicants may proceed with the preparation of the final plan. Preliminary application shall, if requested by the zoning board of appeals, be accompanied by the following: 
(a)  A sepia map with ten (10) prints of a survey of the property in accord with the building regulations showing existing features of the property, including specimen trees, structures, streets, easements, utility lines and existing land use. 
Cross reference- Building regulations, title 4. 
(b)  A sepia map with ten (10) prints of a preliminary development plan which shall be in conformance with the approved tentative plan, showing, as appropriate, all of the information required on the tentative development plan; the approximate location and proposed density of dwelling units; nonresidential building intensity; and land uses considered suitable for adjacent properties. 
(1)  Proposed land uses, population densities and building intensities. 
(2)  Proposed circulation pattern, indicating both public and private streets and off-street parking ratio. 
(3)  Proposed parks, playgrounds, school sites and other open spaces. 
(4)  A market analysis of proposed commercial uses, if the property is not zoned for commercial purposes at the time of submittal of the preliminary development plan. 
(5)  Delineation of the units to be construed in progression, if any. 
(6)  Relation to future land use in surrounding area and East Peoria Comprehensive Plan. 
(c)  A schedule for the development of units to be constructed in progression and a description of the design principles for buildings and streetscapes; tabulation of total number of acres in the project and the percent thereof designated for various uses; the number of dwelling units proposed by type of dwelling for each unit of the development; estimated residential population by type of dwelling for each unit of the development; estimated nonresidential population; proposed retail sales by unit and economic justification; anticipated timing for each unit and standards for height, open land in streets, population density and public improvements proposed for each unit of the development whenever the applicant proposes an exception from the standard zoning district or other ordinance regulations governing development. The applicant shall provide an itemized list of exceptions by unit and by zoning district, when exceptions are requested by the applicant from the standard zoning district. 
(d)  The written approval of every property owner within the development to be bound by the proposed agreements and conditions, and to agree to file the written agreement with the Recorder of Deeds of Tazewell County before the final plan is approved by the city council. 
(e)  Engineering feasibility studies, as necessary. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91) 
5-12-6. - Final approval of planned development special use permit. 
    Planned development approval shall be secured for each unit of the development as delineated on the preliminary development plan and approved by the zoning board of appeals and the city council. Planned development plans shall be concerned with but not necessarily limited to the following: 
(a)  A sepia map with ten (10) prints of the site plan showing buildings, various functional use areas, circulation and their relationships. 
(b)  Preliminary building plans, including floor plans, exterior elevators and outline specifications of type of building materials, type of wall and roof construction, type of pavement and surfacing materials. 
(c)  Landscaping plans including type of plant materials and their arrangement. 
(d)  Engineering plans, including site grading, street improvements, drainage and public water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer extensions, as necessary. 
(e)  Information necessary for elevation and assignment of fire zone designations, including proposed use and occupancy, and building heights and area of each building or structure, and proposed distances between buildings and structures and distances to property lines. 
(f)  There shall also be submitted with the final plan a written agreement of restrictions assuring the city that the development will be carried out in full compliance with the final plan and within the time schedule of construction submitted with the final plan. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91) 
5-12-7. - General standards. 
    A planned development shall conform to the following requirements: 
(a)  The number of dwelling units erected shall not exceed the number permitted by the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(b)  The yards and open spaces adjoining the boundaries of the project shall not be less than the yard requirements of the district in which it is located. 
(c)  If a building is permitted to exceed the height limit of the district in which it is located, the yards and open spaces around such building shall be increased by an amount equal to the height that the building exceeds the height limit of the district measured in feet. 
(d)  Uses other than those authorized as permitted or special uses within the zoning district in which the planned development is proposed to be located may not be approved unless all of the following conditions and limitations have been met: 
(1)  The zoning board of appeals finds that the otherwise unauthorized uses are necessary to the success of the development; 
(2)  The zoning board of appeals finds that the otherwise unauthorized uses are not of a nature or so located as to have a detrimental influence on the development or on the surrounding neighborhood; 
(3)  Not more than one-third of the ground area of such development shall be devoted to the otherwise unauthorized uses; 
(4)  In a planned development which includes uses authorized in the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts pursuant to chapter 10 of this title, the otherwise unauthorized uses shall conform with the performance standards for industrial uses as set forth in chapter 10 of this title; 
(5)  The otherwise unauthorized uses so allowed are recorded on the zoning district maps by appropriate symbols or by reference to documents on file with the zoning administrator; 
(6)  Where the planned development is to be located in a residential district, no otherwise unauthorized use shall be allowed unless the area of the planned development exceeds twenty (20) acres; 
(7)  No portion of a planned development occupied by an otherwise unauthorized use may either before or after completion of the development be subdivided in such a manner as to separate the area occupied by the otherwise unauthorized use from the remainder of the development. 
(e)  The amount of off-street parking must be adequate to serve the needs of the projects, and the zoning board of appeals and city council may require more off-street parking than is otherwise required by this title. 
(f)  If any open space or recreational facility is to be used solely by the residents of the project, adequate provisions shall be made for assessments against the property within the project so that such facilities can be properly improved, maintained and operated. 
(g)  Underground utilities. Underground utilities including telephone and electric systems, are required within the limits of the planned development. Appurtenances to these systems which can be effectively screened may be excepted from this requirement if the zoning board of appeals finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the development. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91; Ord. No. 4141, § 2, 2-18-14) 
5-12-8. - Bulk regulations. 
    In the case of any planned development, the zoning board of appeals may recommend, and the city council may authorize, exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of this chapter within the boundaries of such development, provided that the board shall find: 
(a)  That such exception shall be solely for the purpose of encouraging a desirable living environment. 
(b)  That along the periphery of planned developments, yards shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which said development is located. 
(c)  That the minimum lot area per dwelling unit requirements of this title would not be decreased by more than fifteen (15) percent in any such development containing residential uses. 
(d)  That spacing between principal buildings shall be at least equivalent to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly developed under the terms of this title on separate lots, due consideration being given to the openness normally afforded by intervening streets and alleys. 
(e)  That maximum lot coverage in a residential planned development not exceed thirty (30) percent in the residential zoning districts. 
(f)  Other standards for yard regulations, signs, parking, loading and screening for a planned development shall be governed by the standards of the residential, commercial or industrial zoning district(s) most similar in nature and function to the proposed planned development as determined by the zoning board of appeals. Standards for public improvements shall be governed by the applicable ordinances and laws of the city. Exceptions to these standards by the zoning board of appeals and the city council are possible when these bodies find that such exceptions are warranted in terms of the total proposed development unit thereof. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91) 
5-12-9. - Approval. 
    Whenever the zoning board of appeals and city council approve the final plan and accompanying agreements, the zoning administrator shall issue the necessary permits for all of the project or for such phases thereof that are to be first constructed. The zoning administrator may, from time to time, approve minor changes within the project, but such changes shall not be of a nature that would affect the character and standard of the planned development. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91) 
5-12-10. - Time limit. 
    At the time of approval of a final plan, the city council may in its discretion establish a deadline for the commencement or completion of a planned development or any component thereof. Except where a different deadline is or has been provided by the city council, a planned development special use permit shall be deemed to have automatically terminated on the fourth anniversary of the date of approval of the final plan by the city council unless all buildings, structures, streets or other improvements shown on the final plan approved by the city council have been completed in accordance with the approved plan. 
    The city council may in its discretion extend any deadline established for a planned development after receiving a recommendation from the zoning board of appeals following a hearing conducted in the manner prescribed for a special use. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91) 
5-12-11. - Performance. 
    At the time of the granting of the permit, the city council shall make appropriate arrangements with the applicant which will insure the accomplishment at the scheduled times of the public improvements and grants of easement shown on the approved final plan. 
(1970 Code) 
5-12-12. - Planned development permit. 
    Any person entitled to file an application for a zoning amendment may contemporaneously file an application for a planned development. A single notice and hearing may be used for such joint application. The zoning board of appeals shall make specific findings of fact with respect to each application and shall make its recommendations both on the application for the amendment and on the application for the planned development and the city council shall make separate decisions on both applications, the decision on the application for the planned development being governed by the provisions of section 5-12-1 of this chapter. If, during the course of a hearing on an application for an amendment reclassifying specific property to a different district, the applicants representations or evidence tend to show that the proposed development would constitute a planned unit development as defined in section 5-12-2 hereof, the zoning board of appeals may treat the application as a joint application pursuant to the above, for both the amendment requested and for the grant of a planned development use permit, such joint application to be handled according to the procedures specified above. In such case, the previously published notice of the hearing on the application for amendment shall be deemed to have constituted notice that an application for a planned development was requested; provided, however, that no application which grants any use exceptions pursuant to section 5-12-1 hereof shall be granted unless the previously published notice specifically indicated that such planned development use permit might be granted, or unless the zoning board of appeals orders an additional notice and hearing. The provisions of section 5-12-1 shall be printed on every application for an amendment. 
(Ord. 2544, 10-29-91) 
CHAPTER 13. - OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS[3] 
SECTION: 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 1595, dated Aug. 28, 1979 repealed former Title 5, ch. 13 pertaining to transitional zoning classification for the Richland Area and was further amended by Ord. No. 3861 adopted Oct. 6, 2009, to read as set out herein. 

5-13-1. - Purpose. 
    An overlay district is intended to provide a regulatory framework that will facilitate innovative approaches to the development or redevelopment of land. Adopted overlay district plans applicable within an overlay district may allow within its boundaries the mixing of uses not ordinarily authorized within traditional zoning districts, unusual bulk or coverage characteristics, shared or unusual parking facilities, modified front, side and rear yard regulations, nontraditional lot sizes and configurations and nontraditional layouts of public infrastructure including, without limitation, streets, utilities and parks. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-2. - Manner of creation. 
    The city council may in the manner provided by this chapter designate an overlay district within any one (1) or more of the traditional zoning districts authorized elsewhere in this title. The boundaries of any overlay district designated as provided in this chapter shall be shown on the official zoning map as an overlay with respect to the existing underlying district or districts with the additional designation of "OD" followed by the number of the ordinance which designated the overlay district. No overlay district may be designated without the simultaneous approval of a plan for the overlay district. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-3. - Application for designation. 
    The City of East Peoria or any other person or entity may apply to the zoning administrator for the designation of an overlay district. Any such application must include: 
(1)  The name, address, telephone number and email address of the applicant; 
(2)  A legal description of the proposed overlay district; 
(3)  The property identification numbers of all parcels located within the proposed overlay district; 
(4)  A proposed overlay district plan having the content hereinafter specified. 
    Any application submitted by any person or entity other than the city, must include the written consent to the proposed designation and plan of at least one (1) owner of record of at least two-thirds 2/3 of the parcels proposed to be located within the overlay district and at least two-thirds 2/3 of the total area of the proposed district. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-4. - Content of overlay district plan. 
    An overlay district plan may provide for uses, housing types, minimum lot and yard requirements and setbacks, standards for building height and bulk, accessory uses, accessory buildings, parking facilities, standards for signs, and public or private infrastructure within the overlay district which supersede regulations otherwise applicable within the underlying zoning district and, where applicable, any standards for the subdivision of land within the overlay district which are inconsistent with the standards found at title 6, chapter 3 of this Code. An overlay district plan must include at least the following components: 
(1)  A description of the overall theme or purpose of the proposed overlay district; 
(2)  A detailed recitation of any modifications to zoning regulations or subdivision standards which would be applicable within the proposed overlay district; 
(3)  A map drawn at a scale of one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet or such other scale as the zoning administrator may approve showing the following information: 
a.  The boundary of the proposed overlay district; 
b.  All streets and zoning districts lying outside of but within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the proposed overlay district; 
c.  All existing or proposed streets located within the boundaries of the proposed overlay district; 
d.  Major improvements which the applicant proposes to construct within the proposed overlay district; 
e.  The underlying use districts applicable within the proposed overlay district. 
    Except where specifically superseded or modified in the overlay district plan approved upon the designation of the overlay district, all regulations applicable within the underlying use district or districts over which the overlay district is superimposed shall continue to apply as if the overlay district did not exist. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-5. - Minimum area. 
    An overlay district must have an area of not less than five (5) acres and must be compact and contiguous. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-6. - Procedure for consideration of application. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an application for designation of an overlay district shall be considered in accordance with the procedure established for the amendment of this title found at section 5-11-9 of this title 5. For purposes of considering an application for designation of an overlay district, any references in section 5-11-9 to an application or proposal for an amendment shall be construed as a reference to an application or proposal for designation of an overlay district. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-7. - Notification of proposed designation of overlay district. 
    Notice of a public hearing on an application for designation of an overlay district shall be published in the same manner and on the same schedule as notices of proposed amendments to this title are published. In addition to the published notice of hearing on the proposed designation of an overlay district, if an application for the designation of an overlay district includes one (1) or more parcels owned by someone other than persons whose written consent to designation of the overlay district have been submitted with the application for designation, the applicant must give written notice of the hearing to the person or persons in whose name general real estate taxes for each such parcel were or are to be billed as shown on the most recent records maintained by the Tazewell County Clerk. Such written notice shall contain the same information as the notice published by the zoning administrator with respect to the proposed overlay district and shall either be personally served or sent by certified mail/return receipt requested at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing on the designation of the district. The applicant shall provide evidence in a form satisfactory to the zoning administrator that such notice has been given. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-8. - Modification of overlay district plan. 
    After submission of an application for designation of an overlay district, but prior to such designation, the city council may in its discretion modify the plan proposed by any applicant. After the designation of an overlay district and approval of a plan for that district, such plan may not be modified except in accordance with the procedure established in this chapter for the initial designation of an overlay district and approval of a plan for that district. 
(Ord. No. 3861, § 1, 10-6-09) 
5-13-9. - Modification of boundaries. 
    After submission of an application for designation of an overlay district, but prior to such designation, the city council may in its discretion, modify the boundaries of the proposed district to exclude territory originally proposed for inclusion in the overlay district.

2.  Controlled run-off. Concentrated run-off from impervious surfaces shall be conveyed away from a steep slope to a municipal storm sewer system if available, or through grassed swales, infiltration trenches or other sound professional engineering practices designed to infiltrate stormwater runoff and minimize erosion. If infiltration is not deemed appropriate, concentrated run-off from impervious surfaces shall be collected and transported in drainage lines. Stormwater pipes conveying concentrated runoff to the bottom of a steep slope shall generally be located above ground, but may be located below ground with the approval of the director. 
Sump pump drain lines shall be connected to a municipal storm sewer system if located within three hundred fifty (350) feet thereof. 
3.  Interceptor ditches. When sound professional engineering practice dictates or when required by the director, interceptor ditches shall be established outside of steep slope zones in order that soil shall not become saturated and the intercepted water shall be conveyed in a pipe or other approved manner to a municipal storm sewer system, if available, or to the bottom of a slope in a manner designed to minimize erosion. 
4.  Discharge point stabilization in steep slopes. Natural drainage ways shall be stabilized by landscape integration, rip-rap, rolled erosion control products or other means consistent with sound professional engineering practice, to a distance below drainage and culvert discharge points sufficient to convey the discharge while minimizing channel erosion and in such a manner as to dissipate the energy of the discharge. 
5.  Early completion. The overall drainage system shall be completed and made operational at the earliest possible time during construction. 
6.  Impact on adjacent property. The natural or usual flow of surface or subsurface water shall not be altered or obstructed by grade changes in any way that may adversely affect the property of another by either contributing to pooling or collection of waters or to the concentration or intensification of surface water discharge. However, construction which might otherwise be prohibited hereinabove may be allowed if such waters are properly drained by a pipe or other approved manner to a municipal storm sewer system, if available, or to the bottom of the steep slope. 
(b)  Vegetation and revegetation. 
1.  Natural vegetation. Every effort shall be made to maintain natural vegetation in a steep slope zone. 
2.  Smallest area. When construction activities are authorized in a steep slope zone, the smallest practical area of raw soil shall be exposed for as short a duration of time as practical. When sound professional engineering practice dictates or when required by the director, temporary vegetation, or other acceptable cover shall be used to protect areas of raw soil exposed during construction. 
3.  Revegetation. A mixed planting of perennial and woody species (preferably native species with adequate deep root systems) shall be used to landscape disturbed areas in a steep slope zone. 
4.  Tree removal. It shall be unlawful to remove any protected tree from a steep slope zone without the approval of the director. 
5.  Long term management. The director shall encourage the owners of property containing steep slope zones including, in particular, those who apply for permits to undertake construction activities as authorized under the provisions of this chapter, to learn and implement the most current techniques for the management of the forested areas of the steep slope zones in accordance with the best available scientific information. 
(c)  Earth moving. 
1.  Minimum alterations. Earth moving shall be limited to the minimum required for building foundations, driveways, drainage control structures, and immediate yard areas. 
2.  Erosion control. All earth moving shall be accomplished in a manner which will create the lowest possible potential for erosion. 
3.  Soil fill on steep sloped land. All fill in a steep slope zone is prohibited, other than back-fill which is determined by the director to be necessary for slope stabilization. 
4.  Prompt completion. All earth moving shall be accomplished in the shortest practical period of time. All excess excavated material shall be removed from the steep slope zone and no temporary or permanent storage of material shall be permitted within the steep slope zone. No existing natural vegetation shall be destroyed, removed or disturbed prior to the initiation of earth moving activities.

(a)  Whenever a proposed subdivision contains a land area of six (6) acres or more, the subdivider will, at the recommendation of the city planning commission, be required to sell at fair market value to be determined by appraisal, a reasonable area for public use as park, recreational use, school or other public purpose site. The date of appraisal will be as of the date of submission of the preliminary subdivision plat. Such area sold shall be in addition to all dedications for streets and thoroughfares. 
    In determining the area to be sold for public use, the planning commission shall give due consideration to present and anticipated population density within such subdivision and to the present and future requirements for such public needs; provided, however, that no subdivider shall be required to sell land to a public body for the aforesaid purpose in excess of seven (7) percent of the total land area within the subdivision.

An appraiser shall be named by the subdivider and another appraiser shall be named by the interested public body. If necessary or appropriate, these two (2) appraisers may name a third appraiser. Each appraiser will appraise the public land completing a fully documented competent appraisal using established appraisal processes incorporating all applicable approaches to value. The city, school board and park board or any other public body shall have an option to buy said land from the subdivider based on the appraisals. The time limit on this option shall be six (6) months from the date the subdivision is accepted by the city council. 
(b)  The location of lands set aside or offered for sale for public use shall be agreed to by the subdivider and the planning commission prior to the subdivision's acceptance by the commission. Proposed sites for parks, playgrounds, schools or other public uses, shall be suitably incorporated by the developer into his subdivision plan after proper determination as to its necessity or desirability by the commission and the appropriate public agency involved in the use. 
(c)  All land conveyed or reserved for acquisition by a public agency shall be of sufficient size and character to meet the minimum frontage and area requirements for lots under the zoning ordinance of the city and shall otherwise be suitable for the purposes intended. 
(d)  Whenever a preliminary plan includes a proposed establishment of common open space to be owned and operated by other than a public agency, and the planning department finds that such land is not suitable for common land due to terrain, lack of accessibility, benefit to only a limited number of property owners, or difficulty of maintenance, the planning commission, upon recommendation of the planning department, may either refuse to approve such an establishment, or it may require the rearrangement of the lots in the proposed subdivision to include such land within the individual lots. 
(e)  In any case, where common land not to be owned and operated by a public agency is to be permitted to be included in the subdivision of a tract, the developer shall indicate the method of ownership and method of assuring maintenance of the common open space in a means acceptable to the city attorney. The documents establishing ownership and providing some form of continuing assessments for maintenance of such open space shall be recorded simultaneously with the final plat. The city may require such documents to include the right of the locality to carry out maintenance and assess the property owners of the open space for costs incurred in those instances where the mechanism established to carry out the open space maintenance is unable or unwilling to do so. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97) 
6-1-10. - Enforcement.

(b)  The subdivision of any lot or any parcel of land by the use of a metes and bounds description or by any other method with the intent of evading this Title, for the purpose of sale, transfer or lease is unlawful. 
(c)  No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building located on a lot subdivided or sold in violation of the regulations of this Title. 
(d)  No final plat of any subdivision shall be valid nor entitled to record unless and until the same has been approved by the city council in accordance with the procedure hereinafter provided, and no final plat of any subdivision shall be approved without compliance with the provisions of this Title. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97) 
6-1-11. - Penalties. 
    Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this Title shall be subject to a fine of not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each violation, and each day such violation is permitted to exist or continue shall constitute a separate offense.

    The final plat shall be clearly and legibly drawn in permanent black ink upon mylar or similar material. The subdivider shall also submit twenty (20) prints of the final plat. The final plat and accompanying application for approval shall contain the graphic and descriptive items listed below. The subdivider shall pay a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for each lot shown on the final plat. The lack of information under any item specified herein, or improper information supplied by the subdivider, may be cause for disapproval of a final plat: 
(a)  The drawing. 
(1)  The final plat of a subdivision shall be drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet (1? = 100'), and shall be drawn on one (1) or more sheets with dimensions not exceeding twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches. If more than two (2) sheets are required, a cover sheet of the same dimensions shall be included showing the entire subdivision on one (1) sheet and the component areas shown on the other sheets. Linear dimensions are to be given on the final plat to the nearest one-one hundredth ( 1/100 ) of a foot. 
(2)  Subdivision boundaries, easements and lot lines, plus any other lines pertinent to the plat, except contour lines shall be neatly and clearly shown, together with accurately calculated dimensions and bearings so that each line and property corner may be located and reproduced upon the ground.

If the subdivider fails to complete all required improvements in accordance with the approved plans and specifications within two (2) years following the approval of the final plat by the city council, the city may at its option complete or contract for the completion of the public improvements in accordance with such plans and specifications and pay the cost with the security provided by the subdivider. 
(d)  After the subdivider has paid or made arrangements for payment of all water facilities assessments imposed by section 7-5-2.10 of the City Code, all wastewater facilities assessments imposed by section 7-4-6.5 of the City Code and any other applicable fees and after the subdivider has provided security for the completion of required improvements as provided in this section, the subdivider is authorized to commence construction of the improvements. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97; Ord. No. 3901, § 2, 5-13-10) 
6-2-14. - Recording of final plat. 
    Within ninety (90) days after delivery of an approved final plat to the subdivider by the planning department, the subdivider shall record the final plat with the Tazewell County Recorder of Deeds. If the plat is not so recorded, it shall have no validity and shall not be recorded without subsequent approval of the city council. The city council may extend the filing date an additional ninety (90) days if the subdivider demonstrates unique circumstances or conditions whereby the recording of the final plat could not be accomplished as herein required. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97) 
6-2-15. - Preliminary approval of certain components of public improvements. 
    Upon the completion of satisfactory testing, the department of public works may give preliminary approval to watermains, sanitary sewers and streets after installation of curbs and base but before installation of pavement. Upon receipt of such preliminary approval from the public works department, the planning department may issue building permits for the construction of improvements to the lots within the subdivision. In any event, however, no occupancy permit shall be issued until public improvements which serve the lots in the subdivision have been accepted by the city as provided in this title 6. Notwithstanding the receipt of preliminary approval, the city shall not provide city services within the subdivision including, without limitation; maintenance, snow plowing or garbage pickup until final acceptance of all improvements. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97; Ord. No. 3695, § 5, 11-28-06) 
6-2-16. - Inspection of, acceptance of and warranty for public improvements. 
(a)  If any plat of subdivision dedicates public streets, easements or other improvements to the public use, the approval of the final plat by the city council shall not constitute acceptance by the city of any such public improvements, irrespective of any act or acts by any officer, agent or employee of the city with respect to such public improvements. 
(b)  Upon completion of the public improvements, the subdivider and the subdivider's engineer shall submit to the city a signed certificate of compliance which indicates that all public improvements constructed in connection with the subdivision comply with all applicable requirements of this title and that such public improvements were installed substantially in accordance with the approved construction plans and specifications. The certification shall be in a form developed and approved by the planning department and the public works department and shall in general address each requirement imposed by this title. The public works department shall review the certificate of compliance and shall conduct such investigation and inspections as it deems appropriate and recommend to the city council such action as the public works department deems appropriate based upon its review and inspection. 
(c)  Upon completion of the public improvements, the subdivider shall submit "as built" plans for all such public improvements which accurately reflect the location of the public improvements as constructed. Such plans shall be marked by the engineer as "as built" construction plans. The subdivider or the subdivider's engineer shall submit to the city a copy of the "as built" construction plans on a CD-rom in State-Plane '83 Illinois West Projection in ESRI Shapefile format. The city council shall not accept public improvements until the subdivider has submitted "as built" plans in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
(d)  If the city council concludes that the representations made in the certificate compliance are accurate, then the city council shall accept the dedication of the public improvements on behalf of the city. However, such acceptance shall not become effective until the subdivider provides security against structural failure of the public improvements in the form of a surety bond, cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to fifteen (15) percent of the cost of constructing the improvements. Such security shall have the same characteristics as the security for the completion of the public improvements and shall allow the city to draw upon the security to pay costs incurred by the city to repair any structural failure of the public improvements which occurs after the effective date of acceptance of the public improvements by the city. The security less any amount used to repair defective public improvements shall be released to the subdivider after the second anniversary of the effective date of acceptance of the public improvements by the city council. Security for the completion of the public improvements provided at the time of final plat approval shall not be released until such time as the security against structural failure of the public improvements as herein provided has been submitted by the subdivider.

6-2-17. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3695, § 7, adopted Nov. 28, 2006, repealed § 6-2-17, which pertained to release of security for expiration of two-year warranty period and derived from Ord. No. 2982, adopted May 20, 1997. 
CHAPTER 3. - STANDARDS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS 
SECTION: 

6-3-1. - Design and construction standards. 
    The following requirements are hereby established as the minimum standards of design and construction for improvements required to be constructed within subdivisions under the jurisdiction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97) 
6-3-2. - Utilities in general. 
(a)  All utility lines shall be located underground within easements or rights-of-way in a manner which will not conflict with other services. Where possible, the location of any utility lines of any nature whatsoever under pavement shall be avoided. All water, sewer, storm sewers and gas lines unavoidably located under street pavement shall be bedded with granular materials as required by the standard road and bridge specifications or the standard water and sewer specifications as appropriate and backfilled with granular backfill. 
(b)  Telephone, electric, cable TV and gas service shall be placed within easements or rights-of-way in a manner which will not conflict with other services. Above ground structures identified with said underground facilities shall be located so as to not be unsightly or hazardous to the public. 
(c)  Small wireless facilities and accessories shall comply with the location, design and aesthetic requirements of the subdivision plan. Above ground accessories shall be camouflaged and screened, either by landscaping or fencing according to chapter 16.1 of title 4 of this Code and applicable Code provisions relating to appropriate fencing. The camouflaging and screening of all above ground accessories and all poles and accessories shall be submitted to the city for approval pursuant to chapter 16.1 of title 4 of this Code. No small wireless facility, accessory, pole, or structure may be placed in front of a residence, determined to be the street frontage of the width of the residential structure. Neither small wireless facilities, nor their accessories, poles or structures, may obstruct or impede pedestrian traffic, sidewalks, or driveway visibility. In no instance shall a small wireless facility or accessory interfere with the visibility of motorists. 
(d)  The subdivider shall in the manner hereinafter set forth mark the location of certain public utilities passing beneath or adjacent to concrete curbs. The location of utility lines passing beneath a curb shall be marked on the curb immediately above the utility line. All markings shall consist of letters having a height of not less than four (4) inches which are stamped or chiseled into the curb. The following facilities shall be marked in the indicated manner: 
(1)  The location of sanitary sewer mains or sanitary sewer laterals passing beneath a concrete curb shall be marked "SM". 
(2)  The location of watermains passing beneath a concrete curb shall be marked "WM". 
(3)  The location of storm sewers passing beneath a concrete curb shall be marked "SS". 
(4)  The location of a sanitary sewer manhole or storm sewer manhole not located within a paved street shall be marked "MH" on the nearest point of the adjacent curb with an indication of the distance in feet between the back of the curb and the center of the manhole. 
(e)  All water and sanitary sewer mains shall be marked with #12 insulated tracing wire or any alternative material approved by the director of public works. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97; Ord. No. 3901, § 4, 5-13-10; Ord. No. 4396 , § 1, 6-19-18) 
6-3-3. - Streets. 
(a)  No private street or access easement shall be permitted. 
(b)  The design of new streets shall take into consideration compliance with the comprehensive plan, existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, traffic patterns within the development, stormwater runoff, and public convenience and safety. 
(c)  Streets shall be designed to encourage traffic interconnectivity. 
(d)  The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, streets in the new subdivision shall be extended to the boundaries of the subdivision. Temporary culs-de-sac shall be paved with at least one and one-half (11/2) inches of bituminous concrete. The subdivider shall at the subdivider's sole cost and expense install street signs mounted on poles in accordance with standards as may from time to time be prescribed by the public works department. 
(e)  When any subdivision or part of a subdivision is adjacent to only one (1) side of an existing right-of-way which is less than the required width, the subdivider shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the requirements of this title. 
(f)  The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum radius of fifty-two and one-half (521/2) feet and a pavement radius of forty (40) feet. The length of a cul-de-sac street shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet except under unique circumstances related to topography and other factors. Each cul-de-sac street shall be considered on its individual merit. 
(g)  Service roads are required to service areas fronting on state routes and may be required on other major streets. 
(h)  Curves in streets shall have a radius of three hundred (300) feet for major streets and one hundred (100) feet for minor streets. All curb corners shall have radii of not less than twenty-five (25) feet. 
(i)  Drainage gradients of streets shall be five-tenths percent where possible and in no case less than four-tenths percent. Street grades shall not exceed five (5) percent on major streets, nor seven (7) percent on minor streets. Street grades shall provide natural surface drainage of stormwater regardless of the presence of storm sewer facilities. The intent of this requirement is to minimize depressions along any given street profile which will flood in flash storms for which storm sewers are inadequate. Adequate stormwater inlets shall be provided within the street improvements. 
(j)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. Streets shall not intersect at an angle of less than seventy (70) degrees. The intersection of more than two (2) streets shall be avoided unless specific conditions of design dictate otherwise. At each intersection, the corners shall be truncated twenty-five (25) feet in each direction from the true corner. In lieu of standard intersection design, a subdivider may propose a roundabout. The director of public works shall review and comment upon any roundabout proposed by a subdivider. 
(k)  Right-of-way and pavement widths for streets shall be as follows: 
Right-of-Way Width 
(feet) Pavement Width 
(feet) Alleys 20 16 Minor street and service roads 55 28 Collector street 65 36 Major street 80 48 Limited access street 120 52* Street in residential estate subdivision 65 24  
*Four-foot median strip. 
(l)  The full width of the public right-of-way shall be graded, including the subgrade of the areas to be paved. All stumps, trees that cannot be saved, boulders and similar items shall be removed. All unpaved areas within the right-of-way shall be seeded. 
(m)  Curbs and gutters shall be required along the outside pavement line of all streets except streets in approved residential estate subdivisions. Mountable curbs shall be utilized (IDOT Standard 2130-9). Wedge-type curbs will be permitted with prior approval of the public works department. 
(n)  Streets in residential estate subdivisions shall be designed and constructed as rural profile streets in accordance with the standard road and bridge specifications. 
(o)  At such time as a subdivision is proposed adjacent to a street that is presently or will be accepted and maintained by the city, that street shall be improved to handle the increased traffic due to said subdivision and the additional right-of-way and cost of improvement of one-half of the right-of-way adjacent to the proposed subdivision shall be included in the overall subdivision improvement. The improvement, including curb, gutter, storm sewer, sidewalk, and pavement shall be as specified in this title. Where presently impracticable to construct curb and gutter due to lack of similar improvements on other portions of the same road, an escrow fund will be established into which fund the subdivider will be required to place an amount of money sufficient to carry out the improvement. The amount to be placed in such fund will be documented by an engineering estimate of the current cost of the above required improvements to the adjacent road. The escrow fund can thereafter be used by the city in any general overall improvement or upgrading of such road. The estimate will be required prior to approval of the final plat. 
(p)  No lot shall be platted within any area which should be appropriately platted as right-of-way for the purpose of serving adjoining undeveloped property. Furthermore, in such cases the street shall terminate in a temporary cul-de-sac which has frontage of at least fifty-five (55) feet on the boundary of the subdivision. 
(q)  All streets shall be improved to the following specifications or equivalent as approved by the public works department: 
Type Base Surface Alleys, minor collector streets and streets in residential estate subdivisions Flexible pavement 9? compacted aggregate type A (CA-6 or CA-10) 31/2? bituminous concrete surface course, class I Or: 7? stabilized granular material (MS 1000) 31/2? bituminous concrete surface course, class I Major street and service roads Flexible pavement 12? compacted aggregate type A (CA-6 or CA-10) 31/2? bituminous concrete surface course, class I Or: 8? stabilized granular material (MS 1000) 31/2? bituminous concrete surface course, class I Rigid pavement See footnote 8? PCC pavement w/standard reinforcement Limited access streets Flexible pavement 8? stabilized granular material (MS 1800) 4? bituminous concrete surface course, class I Rigid pavement See footnote 9? PCC pavement w/standard reinforcement  
    Footnote: 
The subgrade shall be prepared in accordance with the standard road and bridge specifications. 
(r)  Base which is installed and compacted prior to November 15 of any year shall not be paved until on or after April 15 of the following year. Base which is installed and compacted after November 15 of any year shall not be paved until the second April 15 following the installation of the base. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97; Ord. No. 3695, § 8, 11-28-06) 
6-3-4. - Lots. 
(a)  All lots within a subdivision shall front on a public street. 
(b)  Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
(c)  Residential lots served by public sewer and water systems shall not have an area or width less than that required by the zoning ordinance, except lots fronting on a cul-de-sac shall have not less than thirty (30) feet of frontage at the right-of-way. 
(d)  Lots intended for multifamily, commercial or industrial use shall be adequate to provide off-street service and parking facilities as required by the type of use and development contemplated and in accordance with the zoning ordinance of the city, as amended and shall have a minimum frontage on the public right-of-way of not less than sixty (60) feet. 
(e)  All lots shall be at least one hundred (100) feet in depth. Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit front building setbacks on both adjoining streets. 
(f)  Any other provisions of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, lots in a residential estate subdivision shall have a width at the right-of-way of not less than one hundred fifty (150) feet, except lots in a residential estate subdivision fronting on the turnaround of a cul-de-sac street shall have not less than sixty (60) feet of frontage at the right-of-way. Residential estate subdivisions may be located only within a conservative and residential estate zoning district. 
(g)  Outlots and reserve strips are prohibited. 
(h)  Where no alleys are provided, there shall be dedicated easements of not less than ten (10) feet in width for poles and wires and not less than twenty (20) feet in width for underground conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water or other utility pipes or lines. Such easements shall be established along the rear of each lot and along side lot lines where necessary to provide proper continuity for such utilities from lot to lot and from block to block. Such easements may be centered on lot lines. No structures shall be constructed upon the easements. A ten-foot utility easement shall also be provided adjacent to all right-of-way. 
(i)  Within subdivisions that contain steep slope zones, the city council may in its sole discretion approve requests by the subdivider to reduce front yard setbacks on lots containing steep slope zones but only if the city council finds that such reductions meet the standards of an exception as prescribed by section 6-3-13 of this Subdivision Code. A reduced setback so approved by the city council and shown on the final plat shall supersede any other provision of the City Code which requires a larger setback. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97; Ord. No. 3214, § 4, 5-23-00; Ord. No. 3682, § 8, 4-4-06; Ord. No. 3695, § 9, 11-28-06) 
6-3-5. - Sanitary sewers. 
(a)  Sanitary sewers connected to a public sewer system shall be installed to serve each lot in every subdivision under the planning jurisdiction of the city whether within the city or outside of the city except when a sanitary sewer is unavailable. Lots designed or used for the construction of duplexes, triplexes, townhouses and rowhouses shall include a separate sanitary sewer building stub for each dwelling unit. For purposes of this section, a sanitary sewer is available if it lies within 1.5 miles of any portion of the proposed subdivision. 
(b)  Sanitary sewers shall be designed and installed in accordance with the standard water and sewer specifications. The subdivider shall obtain any required permits from any other agency having jurisdiction. 
(c)  The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer stub terminals to a point at least ten feet inside the property line of each lot in the subdivision.

6-3-6. - Stormwater control systems. 
(a)  The subdivider shall construct or cause to be constructed a stormwater system which shall be adequate to properly drain the subdivision and all other upstream areas that are tributary to the subdivision. Runoff from such upstream areas shall be calculated as if they were fully developed as single-family residential areas with a density permissible for an R-2 zoning classification under the city's zoning code. The stormwater runoff rate from the subdivision shall not exceed the stormwater runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state. The stormwater runoff rate shall not exceed the available capacity of the downstream drainage system. 
(b)  The stormwater system shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the standard road and bridge specifications. Minimum capacity of storm sewers shall be adequate to carry a ten-year rainfall event as defined in publications of the Illinois State Water Survey or other agency performing a similar function. Existing natural waterways in subdivisions shall be preserved or improved as part of the stormwater system. 
(c)  Stormwater control facilities are required to control the release of stormwater from the subdivision in such a manner which will minimize the impact of stormwater from the subdivision on downstream property whether by release rate, erosion or siltation. 
(d)  Stormwater detention areas shall be designed for a minimum of a 25-year rainfall event. Each stormwater detention area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event that a rainfall event in excess of the 25-year rainfall event occurs.

In order to facilitate maintenance, stormwater detention areas shall be conveniently located adjacent to public right-of-way or connected to public right-of-way through an accessible permanent easement. 
(e)  Stormwater detention basin calculations shall be based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The undeveloped stormwater runoff rates for areas thirteen (13) acres or less in area, shall be calculated based on the rational method with a coefficient of runoff not less than twenty-five-hundredths (0.25). 
(2)  The undeveloped stormwater runoff rates for areas thirteen (13) acres or larger in area, shall be calculated based on the method presented in the IDOT Division of Water Resources and USGS Water Resources Investigations 87-4207, "Technique for Estimating Flood Peak Discharges and Frequencies of Rural Streams in Illinois" or any successor publication. 
(3)  The design stormwater runoff rates shall take into account the effects of the development on the time of concentration, rate and quantity of the water discharged. 
(f)  The subdivider's engineer shall analyze and report on the adequacy of the stormwater detention outlet and on the consequences of a 50- and 100-year rainfall event. The system shall be designed to minimize the effects of such events on downstream facilities. 
(g)  Outlet control structures shall be simply designed and shall require little or no maintenance for proper operation. Control structures shall be designed to operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface level. 
(h)  The velocity of stormwater runoff shall be kept at a minimum and turbulent conditions at outfall control structures will not be permitted. 
(i)  No structures shall be constructed within stormwater detention areas or discharge channels. 
(j)  In all subdivisions, ownership and maintenance responsibilities for any component of a stormwater control system lying outside of the dedicated and accepted right-of-way and for all detention facilities shall remain with the property owner(s).

(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97) 
6-3-13. - Exceptions to standards. 
    Where the city council finds the existence of extraordinary circumstances related to the topography or other conditions beyond the control of the subdivider, the city council may where appropriate waive the application of specific standards set forth in this chapter upon a finding of the existence of the following conditions: 
(1)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the subdivider would result as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the regulations were strictly applied to the property; and 
(2)  The conditions are unique to the property for which a waiver is sought and are not applicable generally to other undeveloped parcels of property; and 
(3)  The purpose of the requested waiver is not based exclusively upon the desire to make more money from the property; and 
(4)  The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the application of the regulations in this title and has not been created by any persons having an interest in the property; and 
(5)  The waiver would not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(Ord. No. 2982, § 1, 5-20-97) 
6-3-14. - Exceptions to standards within overlay zoning district. 
    Where the city council has designated an overlay zoning district in accordance with the provisions of title 5 of this Code and the plan approved for that overlay district contains standards for the subdivision of land or the construction of improvements related to the subdivision of land which are inconsistent with the standards established in this chapter, then the standards established in the plan for the overlay district shall prevail over the standards established in this chapter. Except where specifically superseded or modified in the overlay district plan approved upon the designation of an overlay district, all regulations pertaining to the subdivision of land as set forth in this title shall continue to apply within the overlay district as if the overlay district did not exist.

7-4-3.2. - Sewer connections. 
(a)  All connections with any sewer fifteen (15) inches or smaller shall be made by means of a "Y" or "T" branch or other special fitting provided in such sewer for that purpose. 
If a connection to a sewer must be made at any place where a "Y" or "T" branch has not been placed, where feasible, a "Y" fitting shall be placed in the main sewer in the following manner: A section of sewer pipe shall be removed from the main sewer by breaking it into pieces, care being taken not to break, disturb or injure the adjacent pipe. The "Y" fitting shall then be inserted without chipping or breaking the pipe or branch where possible; where not possible, the upper half (when in position) of the bell on the run of the "Y" branch to be inserted and the upper half of the nearest adjacent bell on the existing pipe in the trench shall then be carefully removed and the "Y" branch inserted wrongside up and revolved to bring the branch to the side it is intended for, with the broken part of the bell up. The joint shall then be cemented in the proper manner, the broken parts of the bells being well rounded over with a liberal amount of cement mortar or other approved material. 
(b)  Connections to a sewer may also be made by inserting in the sewer a standard saddle fitting. Such a fitting shall be one designed for that purpose and shall not be improvised from the bell end of a straight length of pipe. Before cutting the hole in the sewer for the saddle fitting, the sides and bottom of the length of pipe in which the hole is to be cut shall be strengthened by a layer of concrete not less than three (3) inches in thickness at any point. The hole in the pipe shall be carefully marked and chipped or pinched out; the saddle placed so that no part projects into the pipe and carefully mortared into position. Sections of pipe shall then be fitted into the saddle to form a riser and all such pieces of pipe which are vertically over the sewer shall be encased in a shaft of concrete having a thickness about the pipe of not less than three (3) inches. The shaft shall firmly rest on the block of concrete encasing the sewer pipe in which the connection was made. The concrete shaft shall be poured into a form of light sheet metal or stove pipe which form shall be left in place as the trench is backfilled. The earth backfill brought up uniformly on all sides to prevent lateral loads upon and the possible breaking of the shaft.

7-4-6. - WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES AND INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY 
7-4-6.1. - Wastewater service charges. 
(a)  Sewer rates established. There shall be and there are hereby established quarterly rates and/or charges for the use and service of the sewage system of the city as described herein. 
(b)  User classification. There is hereby established the following user classification schedule: 
Class 
Designation Description I Those users who generate domestic waste as defined in section 7-4-1.2(e) and 7-4-6.1(g) and who are regular metered water customers of the city. II Those users who generate domestic sewage as defined in section 7-4-1.2(e) and 7-4-6.1(g) and who are not regular metered water customers of the city but are regular metered water customers of another water district. III Those users who generate domestic sewage as defined in section 7-4-1.2(e) and 7-4-6.1(g) and who are not regular metered water customers of the city or another water district; i.e., they use their own water source. IV Those users who generate wastewater that possesses strength characteristics (as measured by BOD and SS) that are in excess of that defined herein and who are not required to pretreat their wastes before discharging into the city's sewer system. V Those users who generate wastewater that possesses strength characteristics (as measured by BOD and SS) that are in excess of that defined and who are required to pretreat their wastes before discharging into the city's sewer system.  
(c)  Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge for the use of and for services supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge, a minimum charge, and a surcharge, if applicable. 
    The debt service charge shall be computed as described in (1) below. 
    The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal concentrations: 
(1)  A five (5) day, twenty (20) degree centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred twenty five (225) mg/l or less. 
(2)  A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred seventy five (275) mg/l or less. 
It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows: 
a.  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all works categories. 
b.  Estimate wastewater volume. 
c.  Compute cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage strength. 
A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal concentrations for BOD (less than two hundred twenty five (225] mg/l) and SS (less than two hundred seventy five mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the two hundred twenty five (225) mg/l and two hundred seventy five (275) mg/l concentration for BOD and SS, respectively and shall be computed as follows: 
(3)  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all work categories. 
(4)  Proportion the estimated costs for all facilities categories by volume, suspended solids, and BOD if possible. 
(5)  Compute cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons allocable to BOD and SS removal. 
(6)  Compute surcharge costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for wastewaters in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS. 
The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public accountants for the city in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs. 
(d)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic sewer user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of one thousand (1,000) gallons; provided, however, that the volume of flow passing through an auxiliary meter installed as hereinafter set forth in this section shall be subtracted from the metered water consumption for the purpose of determining basic sewer user charges. 
(1)  Those users who are classified as class II or III may install and maintain, at their expense, water meters of a type approved by the superintendent of the wastewater treatment division for purposes of determining the volume of water obtained from other sources. If such a meter is already installed, then bimonthly water consumption figures to the nearest one thousand (1,000) gallons shall be provided by the user to the city or should be made readily accessible to the city by the utility providing the water. 
(2)  Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharge may be required by the superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. 
(3)  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste which are installed shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person making the installation. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled, without the consent of the superintendent. 
(4)  For the purpose of determining the amount of water purchased by a customer which does not pass into the sanitary sewer system, an auxiliary water meter may be installed. An auxiliary meter shall be installed in such a fashion that in the opinion of the superintendent, water flowing through such meter is not likely to pass into the sanitary sewer system. Auxiliary meters shall be purchased, installed and maintained at the sole expense of the customer. Auxiliary meters shall be equipped with a remote register mounted in a location accessible to meter readers. Prior to use for billing purposes, an auxiliary meter installation must be inspected and approved by a representative of the water department. In order to defray the additional cost of administration, there shall be in addition to all other charges, a bimonthly administration fee of four dollars ($4.00) with respect to such auxiliary meter. Persons taking a credit against metered water consumption for water passing through an auxiliary meter shall not be entitled to a credit against their sewer use charges as elsewhere provided in this chapter for those persons having swimming pools. 
(e)  Debt service charge. A debt service charge, CD, of $0.00 (zero) per one thousand (1,000) gallons to each user of the wastewater facility of the city is hereby established. The parameter CD is determined as described in subsection 7-4-6.1(i). 
(f)  Basic user rate schedule:

N I ss = [(SS × Q) - M SS;sub \sub; × Q;sub \sub;] × 8.34 + (DP × 10 6 ) i = 1  
Where N I , Q;sub \sub;, Q and DP are defined as in (1) above, 
SS;sub \sub; = 
Average 12 month prior year's wastewater SS concentration from user i in mg/l, 
SS = 
Average prior 12 month wastewater SS concentration of treatment works influent in mg/l, and 
ss = 
Per capita SS, in lbs. SS/capita/day. 
(4)  If the information necessary to compute the per capita parameters q, bod and ss is not available, the following values may be used unless otherwise specified by the superintendent. 
q = 
100 gallon/capita/day, 
bod = 
0.17 lb. BOD/capita/day, and 
ss = 
0.20 lb. SS/capita/day. 
(c)  Cost per capita. The dollar cost per capita, CSTPC, shall be determined as follows: 
CSTPC = Cost/[DP+1/3 (PE BOD + PE SS + PE Q )] 
where cost = 
Portion of any state obtained for financing of construction of wastewater treatment works allocable to treatment of industrial wastes, 
DP = 
Design year domestic population, 
PE BOD  = 
Design year industrial population equivalent based on 5-day BOD, 
PE SS  = 
Design year industrial population equivalent based on SS, and 
PE Q  = 
Design year industrial population equivalent based on volume. 
(d)  Cost for industrial user. The cost to be recovered from an industrial user, COST;sub ..... sub;, shall be determined as follows: 
COST;sub \sub; = CSTPC × 1/3 × (PE BOD i + PE SS i + PE Q i 
where PE BOD i  = 
Population equivalent based on user i's 5-day BOD, 
PE SS i  = 
Population equivalent based on user i's suspended solids, and 
PE Q i  = 
Population equivalent based on user i's wastewater volume. 
(e)  Charge for industrial cost recovery. Each year during the industrial cost recovery period, each industrial user of the treatment works shall pay the cost recovery amount determined as above in (d) for such industry, divided by the recovery period. Where an industry is connected to a public sewer after the start-up of the facilities constructed under a state grant, such industry shall only pay its portion of the state grant for each quarter remaining in the recovery period. Such industry will not be required to pay for those quarters of the recovery period prior to connection to a public sewer. 
(f)  Length of industrial cost recovery period. The industrial cost recovery period shall be equal to the useful life of the treatment works which shall be thirty (30) years from year of construction. 
(g)  Payments and billing periods for industrial cost recovery. For the purpose of industrial cost recovery, the year shall be divided into quarterly periods, said periods to begin on the first day of July, October, January, and March, and all industrial users of the city shall pay the cost as determined in (d) above for industrial cost recovery and billing shall be made quarterly on the fifteenth day of the month immediately following the expiration of the quarterly period, for which service has been supplied, and such charge shall be payable within thirty (30) days after rendition thereof, and in the event such bills are not paid within said thirty (30) days, a service charge of five (5) percent shall be added thereto. 
(h)  Delinquency and termination of service. In the event the charges for industrial cost recovery are not paid within thirty (30) days after the rendition of that bill, then such service charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be delinquent, and thereafter such delinquent charge shall constitute a lien upon the real estate for which such sewer services were supplied. The city clerk is hereby authorized and directed each quarter to file sworn statements showing such delinquencies in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Tazewell County, Illinois, and the filing of such statements shall be deemed notice of a lien for the payment of such charges for sewer service. If the delinquency in the payment of the recovery cost continues for a period of more than thirty (30) days, the sewer service shall be discontinued. 
(i)  Time of first payment. The initial payment made by an industrial user which is connected to a public sewer after the start-up of the treatment works constructed with a state grant shall be made by the next regular due date as defined above in subsection (g) and shall be equal to one quarter of the amount as determined as described in subsections (d) and (e) above. 
(j)  Adjustment of charge due to strength of volume changes. If there is a change in the strength and/or volume introduced into the treatment works by an industrial user as determined by the previous year's records, the city may adjust the users portion of any state grant accordingly. 
(k)  Adjustment of charge due to plant improvement utilizing state grant funds. If there is any expansion of upgrading of the treatment works utilizing a state grant, each existing industrial user's share shall be adjusted accordingly. 
(l)  No charge for unused or unreserved capacity. Any industrial user's portion of any state grant shall not include any portion of the grant amount allocable to unused or reserved capacity. 
(m)  Commitment for increased use. An industrial user's portion of any state grant shall include allowance for the cost of any firm commitment to the city for any increased use by such user. 
(n)  Payment to the State of Illinois required. The city shall retain fifty (50) percent of the amounts recovered from industrial users. The remainder, together with any interest earned thereon, shall be returned to the State of Illinois Anti-Pollution Fund on an annual basis. 
(o)  Disposition of retained amounts. Eighty (80) percent of the retained amounts, together with interest earned thereon, shall be used solely for the eligible costs of the expansion or reconstruction of treatment works associated with the project and necessary to meet the requirements of the Federal Act and the State of Illinois. The city prior to commitment of the retained amounts shall obtain written approval of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for any expansion or reconstruction. The remainder of the retained amounts may be used for such expenditures as the city deems appropriate. 
(p)  Investment of retained amounts required. Pending use, the grantee shall invest the retained amounts for reconstruction and expansion in: 
(1)  Obligations of the U. S. Government; or 
(2)  Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S Government or any agency thereof; or 
(3)  Shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully collateralized by obligations of the U.S. Government or by obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof. 
(q)  City Clerk of East Peoria responsibility. The Clerk of East Peoria shall maintain the necessary records for determination of user share of the cost and shall provide the billing and collection services as required by subsection (h) above. 
(r)  City of East Peoria Treasurer responsibility. City of East Peoria Treasurer shall be responsible for the investment and expenditure of all monies collected for industrial cost recovery in accordance with subsections (n), (o), and (p) above. 
(s)  Monitoring required. The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of water and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special conditions for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge. 
    The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city but no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the Federal, state, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the city at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and reporting required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.

(1)  Is subdivided after November 15, 1988, in accordance with the provisions of the East Peoria Subdivision Code; and 
(2)  Is subdivided into four (4) or more lots, any of which are to be served by wastewater main extensions to be constructed at the expense of the subdivider; and 
(3)  Has not been previously subject to an assessment under the provisions of Article 9 of the Illinois Municipal Code for the installation of wastewater mains or other components of the wastewater system; 
shall be subject to a wastewater facilities assessment in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each acre of land represented on the plat of subdivision. Payment of any such assessment shall be made prior to the execution and delivery of the plat of the subdivision. 
(b)  Certain individual lots. Except as otherwise provided in this section 7-4-6.5, upon application for a new wastewater service connection for a building or property, the applicant and/or the owner of any of the following classes of property shall pay to the city a wastewater facilities assessment in the amount of two thousand two hundred dollars ($2,200.00) per connection. The classes of property subject to such assessment are as follows: 
(1)  Any lot created by subdivision after November 15, 1988, of any parcel, which subdivision creates three (3) or fewer lots; or 
(2)  Any lot created by the subdivision of any parcel completed after November 15, 1988, which subdivision, regardless of the number of lots created, is served entirely by wastewater mains installed by someone other than the subdivider; or 
(3)  Any lot annexed to the city after November 15, 1988; or 
(4)  Any lot which, regardless of when created or annexed, will be served by connection to a wastewater main installed by: 
a.  Any private person other than the owner of the lot or a predecessor in interest to the owner of the lot; or 
b.  The city's wastewater department; or 
c.  Special assessment under Article 9 of the Illinois Municipal Code which assessment was not levied against the lot in question; or 
(5)  Any other lot which has not through special assessment under Article 9 of the Illinois Municipal Code or through prior payment of consideration to the city or through installation of wastewater mains or other appurtenances directly contributed to the provision of wastewater mains capable of serving the parcel in question. 
(c)  Proof of prior payment. Any person asserting exemption from wastewater facilities assessments because of prior payments of special assessments under Article 9 of the Municipal Code or because of installation of wastewater mains at the expense of the applicant or a predecessor in interest or for any other reason shall have the burden of producing written receipts or other documentary evidence demonstrating to the sole satisfaction of the city that such exemption is justified. 
(d)  Installment payment of assessments. Provided that the city in its sole discretion determines that the security is adequate, a wastewater facilities assessment due under the terms of this section 7-4-6.5, may be paid in not more than five (5) equal annual installments of principal, the first of which is due no later than six (6) months following the date of application for service together with interest on the principal balance remaining unpaid from time to time at a rate of not less than nine (9) percent per annum. Accrued interest shall be payable on the date of each payment of principal. Installment obligations shall be evidenced by promissory not secured by a mortgage on the premises served by the new wastewater service. The city may in its discretion permit the subordination of any such mortgage to one or more other mortgages on the premises served by the new wastewater service. 
(e)  Discretionary waiver of assessments. The city may in its sole discretion reduce or waive a wastewater facilities assessment under the following circumstances: 
(1)  As an inducement to business enterprises considering a location in East Peoria; provided, however, that no wastewater facilities assessment shall be reduced under the provisions of this subsection to a level less than fifty (50) percent of that otherwise applicable and then only under circumstances where the proposed facility is reasonably anticipated to create at least ten (10) permanent, full-time jobs within eighteen (18) months of the date of application; or 
(2)  Under circumstances where the imposition of a mandated wastewater facilities assessment would be manifestly unjust. 
(f)  Costs of extension and other charges. The provisions of this section contemplate the tap-in to existing mains without the necessity of any extension by the city. In the event any main is extended for the benefit of one or more parcels of real property, the foregoing provisions of this section shall not prohibit the assessment of additional charges representing the cost of extending any such main for the benefit of such parcel or parcels, as such cost is determined by the director of public works. 
(g)  Equitable sharing of costs by owners of benefitted properties. Under certain conditions, the owner or owners of property may bear the entire cost of extending sanitary sewer mains to serve property being developed by such owner or owners under conditions where such extension may secondarily benefit other property which has not yet been developed. Under such conditions, the city council may as a condition precedent to permitting connections from the secondarily benefitted property to such mains require the owner(s) of the secondarily benefitted property to directly or indirectly pay a fee to the person or persons who constructed the main. The fee paid shall equal the benefit received by the secondarily benefitted property as determined by the director of public works.

The statement shall contain a sufficiently correct description of the lot, lots or tracts of land to identify the same, the balance due after allowing all credits, the date upon which such amount became delinquent and a notice that the city claims a lien for this amount, as well as for all charges for sewer service or other services in connection therewith supplied subsequent to the period covered by the bill. 
(b)  No such lien shall be defeated to the proper amount thereof because of an error or overcharge on the part of the city, nor shall any such lien be defeated upon proof that such sewer service was provided to or contracted for by a tenant of the premises or occupant thereof other than the owner. 
(c)  The failure of the clerk to record such lien claim, shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid sewer charges, as provided in this chapter. 
7-4-6.8. - Enforcement. 
(a)  If payment shall not be made as provided in this chapter, any amount due for sewer service, benefits, or other charges provided for in this chapter when the same becomes due, the city may file or cause to be filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Tazewell County for a foreclosure of such lien, or, upon becoming a defendant in any pending suit affecting the premises or real estate, an answer to the complaint in the nature of an intervening petition or a cross-complaint, and the city may proceed in its corporate name to foreclose such lien in like manner and with like effect as provided by statutes of the State of Illinois in foreclosure of mortgages on real estate. Any decree rendered in the court may be enforced and collected as other decrees or judgments in the same court. 
(b)  The city attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the city, in the Circuit Court of Tazewell County or in any court having jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which a bill for sewer use charges has remained unpaid thirty (30) days after it has been rendered. 
(c)  The remedy provided in this section for the collection of delinquent sewer use, charges or benefits shall not be construed to abridge or in any manner interfere with the right and power of the city to enforce a collection thereof by any other action or as otherwise provided in this chapter, but the remedy herein provided shall be taken and held as an additional means to enforce payment of such delinquent water rates, charges or benefits. 
(d)  Expenses incurred by the city for the purpose of collecting delinquent service charges, delinquent facilities assessments or other delinquent fees payable pursuant to this chapter shall be assessed as a supplemental service charge. All owners, occupants and users of the premises provided with service with respect to which such a delinquency exists shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of expenses of collection. Expenses of collection to be assessed as a supplemental service charge under authority of this subsection include, without limitation, attorneys fees incurred by the city for the purpose of collecting any delinquent amounts.

7-4-7. - USE AND PROTECTION OF THE SEWER SYSTEM 
7-4-7.1. - Purpose of sanitary sewer system. 
    The separate sanitary sewer system of the city has been designed and built to carry away domestic sewage and the industrial and commercial wastes as permitted and has not been designed to carry stormwater, surface water or groundwater and any act which shall cause any storm or surface water or groundwater to be conveyed to the sanitary sewers shall be directly contrary to the provisions of this chapter, and is strictly prohibited. 
7-4-7.2. - Use of public sewers required. 
(a)  All property owners within the City of East Peoria, Tazewell County, Illinois, are required to attach any operating human waste disposal systems on their property to available lateral sanitary sewer mains, in such a manner that no sewage is discharged except into said mains. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section, "available lateral sanitary sewer mains" shall mean lateral sanitary sewer mains located within two hundred (200) feet of any property line describing the lot or tract in question and which empty into a disposal plant approved by the State of Illinois. Property subject to an easement which permits or provides access to such a lot or tract shall be considered to be part of the lot or tract for purposes of identifying the property lines of the lot or tract. Where a lateral sanitary sewer main lies within two hundred (200) feet of any property line describing the lot or tract in question but the building to be served lies more than two hundred (200) feet from the lateral sanitary sewer main, then such lateral sanitary sewer main shall not be considered an available lateral sanitary sewer main within the meaning of this section if the city council determines by resolution that all of the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  The building will be connected to an alternative sewage disposal system which is constructed and operated in accordance with regulations adopted from time to time by the Tazewell County Health Department; and 
(2)  The proposed alternative sewage disposal system will not in the opinion of the city engineer adversely affect public health; and 
(3)  The estimated cost of attaching the building to be served to the closest lateral sanitary sewer main exceeds the cost of an alternative sewage disposal system by a factor of more than two (2). 
Any such resolution which is adopted by the city council may impose such conditions as the city council deems necessary for the protection of the public. 
(c)  This section shall not apply to persons who bring their property into compliance with the requirements of this section within eleven (11) months of the passage of this chapter, and maintain said property in compliance with said requirements thereafter. 
(d)  This section shall not apply to persons who bring their property into compliance with the requirements of this section within twelve (12) months after the date of completion of available lateral sewer mains, if there are no available lateral sanitary sewer mains for the property in question at the time of passage of this section, provided that said property is maintained in compliance with said requirements thereafter. 
(e)  For the purposes of this section "date of completion of available lateral sanitary sewer mains" shall mean the date upon which the City Council of the City of East Peoria certifies that said mains are completed and ready for use. 
(f)  Notwithstanding subsections (c) and (d) of this section, discharge of human waste at any time in such a manner or location so as to create a health hazard shall be a violation of this section, said violation to be subject to the penalties of this section. 
(g)  The discharge of sewage in violation of any of the provisions of this section shall constitute and is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance. 
(h)  Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in an amount not less than fifty dollars ($50.00), nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder. 
(i)  No septic tank or cesspool now existing or hereafter constructed shall be connected in any way, directly or indirectly, to the public sewer system. 
(j)  No building permit for the construction of any new dwelling house or commercial building within the city shall be granted until the owner applying for such construction permit shall furnish the director of public works with plans and specifications conforming to the provisions of this chapter, such that the domestic sewage therefrom shall be discharged into the said sanitary sewer system in the manner and by the means herein specified. 
(k)  It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the city or in any area under the jurisdiction of said city, any human or animal excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste.

c.  Has not been previously subject to an assessment under the provisions of article 9 of the Illinois Municipal Code for the installation of water lines or other components of the water system. 
shall be subject to a water facilities assessment in the amount of three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) for each acre of land represented on the plat of subdivision. Payment of any such assessment shall be made prior to the execution and delivery of the plat of the subdivision. 
(2)  Certain individual lots. Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon application for a new water service connection for a building or property, the applicant and/or the owner of any of the following classes of property shall pay to the city a water facilities assessment in the amount of one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00) per connection. The classes of property subject to such assessment are as follows: 
a.  Any lot created by subdivision after November 15, 1988, of any parcel, which subdivision creates three (3) or fewer lots; or 
b.  Any lot created by the subdivision of any parcel completed after November 15, 1988, which subdivision, regardless of the number of lots created, is served entirely by water mains installed by someone other than the subdivider; or 
c.  Any lot annexed to the city after November 15, 1988; or 
d.  Any lot which, regardless of when created or annexed, will be served by connection to a water main installed by: 
1.  Any private person other than the owner of the lot or a predecessor in interest to the owner of the lot; or 
2.  The city's water department; or

e.  Any other lot which has not through special assessment under article 9 of the Illinois Municipal Code or through prior payment of consideration to the city or through installation of mains other appurtenances directly contributed to the provision of water capable of serving the parcel in question. 
(3)  Proof of prior payment. Any person asserting exemption from water facilities assessments because of prior payments of special assessments under article 9 of the Municipal Code or because of installation of water mains at the expense of the applicant or a predecessor in interest or for any other reason shall have the burden of producing written receipts or other documentary evidence demonstrating to the sole satisfaction of the city that such exemption is justified. 
(4)  Installment payment of assessments. Provided that the city in its sole discretion determines that the security is adequate, a water facilities assessment due under the terms of this section, may be paid in not more than five (5) equal annual installments of principal, the first of which is due no later than six (6) months following the date of application for service together with interest on the principal balance remaining unpaid, from time to time, at a rate of not less than nine (9) percent per annum.

The city may in its discretion permit the subordination of any such mortgage to one (1) or more other mortgages on the premises served by the new water service. 
(5)  Discretionary waiver of assessments. The city may in its sole discretion reduce or waive a water facilities assessment under the following circumstances: 
a.  As an inducement to business enterprises considering a location in East Peoria; provided, however, that no water facilities assessment shall be reduced under the provisions of this subsection to a level less than fifty (50) percent of that otherwise applicable and then only under circumstances where the proposed facility is reasonably anticipated to create at least ten (10) permanent, full-time jobs within eighteen (18) months of the date of application; or 
b.  Under circumstances where the imposition of a mandated water facilities assessment would be manifestly unjust. 
(6)  Costs of extension and other charges. The provisions of this section contemplate the tap-in to existing mains without the necessity of any extension by the city. In the event any main is extended for the benefit of one (1) or more parcels of real property, the foregoing provisions of this section shall not prohibit the assessment of additional charges representing cost of extending any such main for the benefit of such parcel or parcels, as such cost is determined by the director of public works. 
(7)  Equitable sharing of costs by owners of benefitted properties. Under certain conditions, the owner or owners of property may bear the entire cost of extending water mains to serve property being developed by such owner or owners under conditions where such extension may secondarily benefit other property which has not yet been developed. Under such conditions, the city council may as a condition precedent to permitting connections from the secondarily benefitted property to such mains require the owner(s) of the secondarily benefitted property to directly or indirectly pay a fee to the person or persons who constructed the main. The fee paid shall equal the benefit received by the secondarily benefitted property as determined by the director of public works.

For purposes of this subsection, the term "fire pit" means any portable or permanent chiminea, fire pit, stove or other similar structure designed to contain outdoor fires. 
(f)  Any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, it shall be lawful for any person as a means of cooking food to burn combustible material ordinarily used for the purpose of cooking food outdoors in any permanent or temporary outdoor fireplace, grill or barbecue pit. Provided, however, that any such fire must be kept under competent and continuous supervision and must be kept a sufficient distance from any building, structure or other material so as not to constitute a fire hazard. 
(g)  If the fire chief or any officer of the fire department concludes that material is being burned in violation of any provision of this section or any other provision of the City Code, then the fire chief or any officer of the fire department may in his or her sole discretion order corrective measures including, without limitation, that the fire be immediately extinguished. It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to comply with the orders of the fire chief or any officer of the fire department regarding any fire, including without imitation fires burning leaves and other landscape waste material pursuant to subsection (b) and fires authorized by the fire chief pursuant to subsection (c). 
(h)  Any person convicted of violating any provision of this section shall be subject to a fine not less than fifty dollars ($50.00), nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00).

Such notice shall be by means of personal service or by certified or registered mail. Personal service shall be by any police officer of the East Peoria Police Department or any person authorized by law to make personal service. If the person served with the written notice to abate fails to request a hearing within the seven-day period, it shall be presumed that the motor vehicle is an inoperable motor vehicle and/or motor vehicle not regularly used, as the case may be, and authorized officials of the city may proceed to abate the nuisance in the manner provided in this section.

The hearing officer shall within seven (7) days following the hearing make written findings of fact regarding the motor vehicle and determine whether or not the motor vehicle constitutes an inoperable motor vehicle and/or motor vehicle not regularly used within the meaning of this section. Such findings of fact and determination shall be served in the same manner as prescribed in this section for service of a notice to abate.

(e)  Any person who shall cause, permit or allow such a nuisance to continue or exist after the expiration of seven (7) days from the date of the notice to abate shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each such offense.

The mayor or his designee shall notify the owner in writing of its determination. The decision of the mayor or his designee shall be final. 
e.  If any officer of the city determines that the public safety requires the immediate impoundment of a dog as authorized by this chapter, the officer shall within a reasonable time notify the owner of the facts and circumstances relating to the impoundment.

Upon receipt of an application, the clerk of the city shall forward such application to the city's code enforcement inspector, who shall cause an inspection of the premises on which the vicious dog shall be kept to determine that all provisions of this section relating to confinement and posting of signs have been complied with by the applicant. Upon completion of the inspection, the code enforcement inspector shall notify the clerk of the city in writing of the results of its inspection. 
d.  Upon receipt of the results of the inspection, the clerk of the city shall notify the applicant of the approval or denial of the license. In the event that the license is denied, the notification shall be provided in writing and the reasons for such denial shall be stated. Upon denial, the owner or keeper of the vicious dog shall remedy the reasons for denial, if possible, and immediately reapply within forty-eight (48) hours, or remove the vicious dog from the municipality within forty-eight (48) hours. Upon approval, the clerk shall issue a license to the applicant. 
e.  A vicious dog license expires annually. No one shall own, possess, keep or maintain a vicious dog without applying annually for a new vicious dog license as provided for in this section to avoid owning, possessing, or maintaining a vicious dog for which the license has expired. 
(3)  Confinement of vicious dogs. No person shall possess any vicious dog unless the vicious dog is confined in accordance with this section.

Alarm systems also include those designed to register a signal which is so audible, visible, or in other ways perceptible outside a protected building structure or facility as to notify persons in the neighborhood beyond the zoning lot where the signal is located who in turn may notify the police or fire department of the signal. Alarm systems do not include those affixed to automobiles. Furthermore, alarm systems do not include auxiliary devices installed by telephone companies to protect telephone equipment or systems which might be damaged or disrupted by the use of an alarm system.

(b)  If the police or fire department personnel at the scene of the activated alarm system determines the alarm system signal was a false alarm, said officer shall make a report of the false alarm. 
(c)  If it is determined that a false alarm does not result in a violation of section 10-5-2, the chief of the police department, the chief of the fire department, or the designee of the chief of police or the fire chief shall cause a notification of the false alarm report to be mailed, by certified mail, or delivered to the alarm user at the address of said alarm system location, advising the alarm user of the false alarm. 
(d)  An alarm user who receives said notification shall have five (5) days within which to inform the chief of the department responsible for issuing the notification that the alarm user disputes the existence of the false alarm.

Such ordinances altering said speed limits shall be enforceable on appropriate signs giving notice of the limits or a record at the proper places or along the proper part or zone of the street or highway. Such ordinances shall be considered amendments to this section and the alterations in speed limits resulting therefrom are set forth in section 11-12-4 of this Title. 
(b)  Driving at greater speed than reasonable and proper for traffic conditions, etc.; duty to decrease speed under certain circumstances. No person shall drive any vehicle upon any street in this city at a speed which is more than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic conditions and the use of the street, which endangers the safety of any person or property, or is more than the applicable maximum speed limit established by sections 11-4-28(a) and 11-4-29 of this chapter. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when special hazards exist with respect to pedestrians or traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions; and the driver of every vehicle shall decrease his speed to such extent as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering a street in compliance with the legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.

SECTION: 

11-10-1. - Effect of chapter. 
    It is hereby declared by the city council that: 
(a)  This chapter is intended to codify herein the applicable rules of the Illinois Supreme Court as set forth in rules 501 through 556, effective April 1, 1977, as said rules effect and pertain to bail and bail procedure for traffic offenses charged under this Title;

11-10-2. - Bail, purpose of. 
    The purpose of bail is only to assure the appearance of the defendant in court. In a serious case where the arresting officer believes the pre-set amount of bail is inadequate for that purpose, the offender shall be brought before a judge without unnecessary delay. When it appears that bail is not necessary to assure defendant's appearance, the arresting officer may instead issue a notice to appear. 
11-10-3. - Bail schedule; traffic. 
(a)  Bail in minor traffic offenses. Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section, a person arrested for a traffic offense under this Title and personally served a ticket shall post bail in the amount of thirty five dollars ($35.00) in one of the following ways:

11-10-5. - Multiple violations. 
    When a person has been arrested for more than one offense arising out of the same occurrence, he is to be released from custody upon furnishing bail on the charge for which the highest bail is required. 
11-10-6. - Cash bail. 
(a)  The arresting officer shall supply a stamped envelope addressed to the Circuit Clerk of Tazewell County and will place the appropriate portions of the ticket in the envelope and give a copy of the ticket to the defendant. The defendant will place in the same envelope the required amount of bail in cash or his driver's license or bond certificate as the case may be. If a court appearance is not required he shall include his signed statement consenting to the entry of an ex-parte judgment if he fails to appear. In the presence of the arresting officer he shall mail same to the circuit clerk. If he does not appear on the appearance date, a judgment may be entered against him for an amount not more than the bail but probably equal to it.

(a)  In all instances, the arresting officer shall fix an appearance date on the defendant's ticket or notice to appear. This date shall be not less than ten (10) days nor more than forty five (45) days from the date of arrest whenever practicable. 
(b)  The arresting officer's failure to appear on the date and at the time fixed for the defendant's appearance, shall not be considered good cause for continuance. If the arresting officer shall be unable to appear on the date fixed, he shall notify the proper prosecutor beforehand so that a new date may be set and the defendant notified. In such case a new appearance date shall be set. All appearances of a person charged with more than one offense arising out of the same occurrence shall be set at the same time whenever practicable. 
11-10-8. - Guilty pleas; hearings. 
    If a ticket does not require a court appearance the defendant may elect either: 
(a)  To appear for hearing on the date fixed by the arresting officer for the defendant's appearance; or 
(b)  If he does not wish to appear he may deliver or mail his plea of guilty on the form supplied to him by the arresting officer to the clerk not earlier than five (5) days after his arrest or later than three (3) days before his appearance date, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The clerk shall apply the cash bail to the payment of the fine and costs and will deliver or mail to the defendant the balance, if any. If the defendant has not posted bail (in effect notice to appear) he shall enclose the total of the fine and costs with his plea of guilty. 
11-10-9. - Bail for persons under seventeen. 
    Persons under seventeen (17) years may be released by giving individual bond (in the amount required by this chapter) if the authorities cannot, within a reasonable time, locate a parent or an adult standing in the place of a parent to execute the bond as surety. 
11-10-10. - Alternative procedure of bail for persons under seventeen. 
    In any case in which the bail specified under this chapter does not exceed fifty dollars ($50.00), a defendant may place cash bail (in the amount required by such rule) in a stamped envelope (to be provided by the arresting officer) addressed to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Tazewell County and, in the presence of the arresting officer, deposit that envelope in a United States Government mailbox. The defendant shall then be released from custody. The appropriate portion(s) of the ticket shall be enclosed with the cash bail. 
11-10-11. - Driver's license or bond certificate deposited in lieu of bail or in addition to bail. 
    If a defendant deposits a driver's license with the arresting officer in lieu of bail or in addition to bail, or deposits a bond certificate, the arresting officer shall note that fact on the violator's copy of the ticket and transmit the driver's license or bond certificate to the clerk within the time provided in this chapter. 
11-10-12. - Copy of bond; receipt for cash bail. 
    A carbon copy of the bond or an official receipt showing the amount of cash bail posted, specifying the time and place of court appearance, shall be furnished to the accused and shall constitute a receipt for bail. The bond or cash bail, or both, shall be delivered to the office of the Circuit Clerk of Tazewell County within forty eight (48) hours of receipt or within the time set for the accused's appearance in court, whichever is earlier. 
11-10-13. - Substitution of cash bail for driver's license or bond certificate. 
    Not sooner than five (5) days after arrest (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) and not later than three (3) days before the date set for appearance in court (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays), the defendant who has deposited his driver's license or a bond certificate in lieu of cash bail may recover either by substituting cash bail in the appropriate amount with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Tazewell County. The clerk may waive the time limit specified by this section. 
11-10-14. - Persons to whom bail is made. 
    Bail for any offense under this Code may be taken by the circuit clerk, his deputies and also by certain law enforcement officers. A list of these officers is available in the Circuit Clerk's office of Tazewell County. They may take the bail at any police station, or any other government office designated by the Chief Judge of the Tenth Judicial Circuit.

11-13-4. - Hearing. 
    Within forty-eight (48) hours after a vehicle is towed/impounded pursuant to this chapter, a representative of the city shall provide a written notice to the owner of record of such vehicle either by personal delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested at the address of the owner as it appears in the records of the Secretary of State. Delivery of the notice to one (1) joint owner of the vehicle shall constitute notice to all joint owners of the vehicle.

The notice shall state the penalties that may be imposed if no hearing is requested, including that a vehicle that is not released by payment of the penalty and fees may be sold or disposed of by the city in accordance with applicable law. The owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the police department no later than fifteen (15) days after the notice was personally delivered or mailed. The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the mayor under authority of title 1, chapter 11 of the City Code. The hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than forty-five (45) days after the request for a hearing has been filed. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing, the hearing officer will notify the owner of record, by mail, of the date, time and location of the hearing. All interested persons shall be given an opportunity to be heard at the reconvened hearing. At any time prior to the hearing, the hearing officer may, at the request of the city or the owner, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply during the hearing, but hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is of the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after considering evidence received during the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with the commission of an offense set forth in section 11-13-1 of this chapter, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of the vehicle civilly liable to the city of an administrative and processing fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00). If bond has been posted in accordance with section 11-13-6 of this chapter, all sums due the city and the tow operator for towing and impoundment fees shall be distributed to the city and tow operator as the case may be. If the hearing officer enters an order finding the owner of record liable to the city for the administrative fee, any vehicle still impounded shall continue to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative fee to the city plus all applicable towing and storage charges to the tow operator or until disposal of the vehicle pursuant to section 11-13-6 of this chapter. If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was not used in connection with the commission of an offense set forth in section 11-13-1 of this chapter, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle and of any cash bond and may order a return of towing and impoundment fees.

11-13-6. - Administrative fee; disposal of vehicles. 
    The administrative fee as imposed pursuant to this chapter, such fee shall constitute a debt due and owing the city. The debt may be satisfied by the bond posted pursuant to this chapter or where no bond is posted by cash, money order, certified check or approved credit card payment service. If the administrative penalty and applicable towing and impoundment fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after the expiration of time for administrative review of the hearing officer's determination or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved and in favor of the city, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(Ord. No. 3805, § 1, 6-3-08) 
11-13-7. - Vehicle possession. 
    Except as otherwise provided by law, no owner, lien holder or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this chapter until the bond and towing and impoundment fees are paid or the administrative penalty and fees applicable under this chapter have been paid. Whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced proceedings to repossess the vehicle, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if she or he agrees in writing to pay to the city from proceeds of the sale of the vehicle the administrative fee, plus applicable towing and storage charges.
