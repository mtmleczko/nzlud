SUPPLEMENTATION 
The Town of Estes Park, Colorado Municipal Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained. 
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last . 
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed under the Supplementation tab, behind this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included. 
The maintenance of a Municipal Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the legislative ordinances of the municipality.

PREFACE 
    The Estes Park Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1972 and republished by Colorado Code Publishing in 1996, has been kept current by regular supplementation. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter and section. Thus, Section 17.12.030 is Section .030, located in Chapter 17.12 of Title 17. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects and where they appear in the codification. 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers.

If a customer is receiving service at more than one (1) location, service at any or all locations may be discontinued for nonpayment of any past due service account if, after transfer of the past due account pursuant to Section 13.08.050, the customer fails to pay an account in full within the period prescribed in Section 13.08.060. 
(4)  Any discontinuance of service pursuant to this Subsection shall be in accordance with and pursuant to the discontinuance regulations set forth in Chapter 13.10 of this Code.

Such deposits will not be considered as advance payment for service bills and will be applied as credits to customers' accounts only after service has been discontinued. The deposit may be in addition to any advance, contribution or guarantee in connection with construction of any lines or facilities as provided for in the Department's line extension policies. In the event any person is in arrears to the Department for electric service, satisfactory arrangements must be made for paying for the old accounts in full before any application for new service will be approved. 
(b)  The Department may return deposits at any time and will return such deposits upon discontinuance of the service after withholding therefrom payment for unpaid charges or bills for service. Deposits will be refunded only after the Department has determined that sufficient evidence exists that the customer is entitled to the return of the deposit.

Service supplied under each electric rate schedule shall be separately measured and billed for, except that any bills transferred to the customer's account pursuant to Section 13.08.050 because of nonpayment for services at other locations may be included in any of the customer's accounts for purposes of billing and collection. 
(b)  Billing errors. 
(1)  The Department will use all reasonable means to avoid billing errors and will, as soon as any error is discovered, rebill for the correct amounts, whether this involves additional payment by the customer or credit to his or her account by the Department, regardless of the time periods involved. Payments due the Department for such errors shall be collected in the same manner as payments for regular bills for service. 
(2)  Incorrect billing due to faulty meter measurement beyond the accuracy limits hereinbefore stated shall be corrected by revised billing based upon corrected readings for a period during which the meter inaccuracy existed, but in no event for a period longer than one (1) year.

(1)  In any case where energy-consuming devices or equipment are connected ahead of the meter or there has been any tampering with or connections to the Department's distribution system or any tampering with the Department's meter, including breaking of meter seals which would make possible or result in the consumption of electricity not registered on the Department's meter, the customer shall be liable to immediate discontinuance of service and to prosecution under applicable laws. 
(2)  In the event of such diversion of electricity, the Department shall be entitled to collect from the customer at the appropriate rate for all additional power and energy estimated by the Department which was not registered on the meter because of such diversion of electricity and also for all expenses incurred by the Department on account of such unauthorized act or acts. Further, service will not be reconnected until the customer shall have installed such entrance and service equipment as is necessary to prevent further diversion of electricity.

13.08.070 - Town's facilities. 
(a)  Continuity of service. The Department will endeavor to furnish and supply, but does not guarantee, uninterrupted electric and broadband service. The Department will not be liable for interruptions due to maintenance functions considered necessary or to causes or contingencies beyond the control of the Department, including but not limited to accidents, breakdown of equipment, acts of God, floods, storms, fires, strikes, riots, war or authority and orders of government, or for disconnection because of unsafe wiring, operation of equipment detrimental to other customers, nonpayment of bills for service or diversion of electricity. The Department shall also be not liable for any injury, loss or damage occasioned by any interruptions arising from the foregoing causes. Such interruptions shall not relieve the customer of payments for service under applicable rate schedules. 
(b)  Shortage of electricity. The Department will make every reasonable effort to furnish a continuous supply of electricity to meet demands. However, should shortages occur by reason of acts of God or causes beyond the immediate control of the Department, the Department shall have the right to grant preference to those services which in its opinion are the most essential to the public welfare. The Department shall not be held liable for monetary loss of business from shortages in supply of electric energy. 
(c)  Liability. All installations of wire, meters, transformers or other materials or equipment made by the Department at its expense shall remain the property of the Department and shall not be tampered or interfered with directly or indirectly by the customer or any other unauthorized persons. The customer shall be liable for any damage or loss to the Department's property or injury to the Department's employees through such unauthorized tampering or interference.

(Ord. No. 02-19 §1(Exh. A), 3-12-2019) 
13.08.080 - Customer's use and facilities. 
(a)  Easements. 
(1)  By making application for electric or broadband service, the customer agrees to grant or arrange for an easement on the customer's property for the installation, operation and maintenance of electric and broadband lines, wires and other equipment of the Department necessary to render service to the customer. When requested by the Department, the customer shall without expense to the Department make or procure conveyance to the Department of satisfactory right-of-way easements across the property owned or controlled by the customer for the Department's lines or extensions necessary or incidental to the furnishing of service to the customer. If such installation must be made on or over the property of a third party, it shall be necessary for the customer to obtain an easement for the Department from the third party before the installation can be made and service rendered. 
(2)  If, after service is originally rendered, the customer should divide his or her property in such a manner that part of it no longer has access to the rights-of-way of the Department's electric or broadband distribution system, the customer shall reserve an easement for the benefit of the Department so that the Department may render electric or broadband service to such isolated part when desired. 
(b)  Right of access. Authorized employees of the Department shall have the right of access to the customer's premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting, repairing, replacing or removing Department-owned equipment. The customer shall provide a means of ingress and egress through locked gates by providing suitable means for a Department lock to be installed on the gate. 
(c)  Foreign power. The customer shall make exclusive use of service provided by the Department, and no other source of electric energy shall be connected to any installation which in turn is connected to the Department's electric distribution system. This does not preclude the use of emergency generating systems owned by the customer, provided that switching arrangements are installed to prevent the possibility of the emergency generator and the Department service being connected to the load simultaneously. The manner of connection of any emergency generating system must be approved by the Department prior to use. 
(d)  Resale of electricity. Electric service will be furnished for the sole use of the customer at the premises designated in the service application and contract, and the customer shall not directly or indirectly sell or otherwise dispose of such service to any other person or persons. The Department reserves the right to refuse to furnish electric service to any customer where such service is to be resold to others. In the event that such resale comes to the attention of the Department, the Department shall have the right to either discontinue service to the customer or to furnish service directly to the subcustomer. 
(e)  Indemnity to Town. The Town shall not be held responsible for any injury to persons or damage to property occasioned or caused by the acts, omissions or negligence of the customer or of any of his or her agents, employees or licensees in installing, maintaining, operating or using any of the customer's lines, wire, equipment, machinery or apparatus and for injury and damage caused by defect in the same. The customer shall hold the Department harmless and indemnify it against any and all claims and liability for injury to persons or damage to property when such damage or injury results from or is occasioned by the facilities located on the customer's side of the point of delivery unless caused by the negligence or wrongful acts of the Department's agents or employees.

(a)  In all cases the facilities so provided shall be constructed in accordance with the Town's standard specifications and shall be the Town's property up to the point of delivery specified in the applicable Town's rules and regulations. 
(b)  In unusual circumstances where, because of the application of the terms of this policy, either the applicant or the Town would be unduly burdened; or where the extensions are deemed necessary or desirable for the development or protection of its territory; or where resale or wholesale customers are involved, the Town reserves the right to deal with such unusual situations independently on their own merits and without reference to the provisions of this policy. 
(c)  The Town may establish special rates for service from an extension providing for the payment of either a fixed charge per customer in addition to the general rates applicable, or a special minimum in case a fair return on the Town's investment is not anticipated. 
(d)  All electric line extension construction shall conform to prevailing standards, based on present-day construction methods and practices, and shall conform to all safety requirements, the work being done in a safe and workmanlike manner. The estimated cost, which shall include all material, labor, engineering, rights-of-way, tree trimming, incidental and overhead expenses necessary to protect the Town's existing system so as to adequately supply the required electrical service, shall be based on the standards but in addition shall include special allowance for items which may be required to meet local construction conditions. Discretion as to character of construction, the capacity required and the route selected for an extension shall rest with the Town. 
(e)  The applicant shall execute the Town's standard right-of-way agreement granting free of charge to the Town such rights-of-way across the applicant's premises as may be required for poles, anchors and other construction work necessary for rendering the service requested by the applicant. 
(f)  The date of service shall be declared as the date the applicant first receives service under the classification requested by the applicant. 
(g)  Where there is more than one (1) customer on an extension, the guarantee of each individual customer may be determined by any method satisfactory to the customers, or may be determined by the Town in general proportion to the cost of construction necessary to serve each customer. 
(h)  In all cases where additional customers desire service from an extension already built on an open contract, the amount of guarantee necessary and its apportionment among customers shall be adjusted on the basis of existing and proposed new customers. If the addition of new customers reduces the guarantee required of existing customers, advanced construction deposits made by new customers will be credited to existing customers' accounts in direct proportion to the amount originally advanced. If the inclusion of new customers increases the amount of guarantee required of existing customers, the extension necessary for the new customers will be calculated separately as a new extension and according to provisions in preceding paragraphs.

Chapter 17.28 - Floodplain Regulations 

17.28.010 - Purpose. 
    It is the overall purpose and intent of this Chapter to promote the health, safety and general welfare to provide adequate zoning regulations to minimize death, injury and losses to public and private property due to flooding. It is further intended that these regulations will help to identify and clarify where flood hazards may exist and to insure that potential buyers or builders are aware that certain properties are in areas with special flood hazards. 
(Ord. 22-86 §1 Exhibit A (part), 1986) 
17.28.015 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this Chapter only, certain terms and words are defined as set forth in this Section: 
    Critical Facility or Critical Facilities means a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified as essential facilities per American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE/SEI 7) and Article 5, Section H of the Colorado Floodplain Damage Prevention Ordinance, that if flooded may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood. 
    Floodplain Administrator means the community official designated by the Town Administrator to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be kept free of obstructions in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Freeboard means the vertical distance in feet above a predicted water surface elevation intended to provide a margin of safety to compensate for unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood, such as debris blockage of bridge openings and the increased runoff due to urbanization of the watershed. 
    No-rise certification means a record of the results of an engineering analysis conducted to determine whether a project will increase flood heights in a floodway. A no-rise certification must be supported by technical data and signed by a registered Colorado Professional Engineer. The supporting technical data should be based on the standard step-backwater computer model used to develop the one-hundred-year floodway shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM). 
    Regulatory Floodplain means the one-hundred-year floodplain. Previously designated floodplain areas that have been removed from FEMA's effective regulatory floodplain by a Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) shall be regulated by requiring all new and substantially improved structures on these lands to maintain the lowest floor above the base flood elevation, consistent with development in the regulatory floodplains. 
(Ord. 7-87 §8, 1987; Ord. 8-90 §3, 1990; Ord. 15-97, 1997; Ord. 14-13 §1, 2013; Ord. No. 16-16 , §1(Exh. A), 6-14-2016) 
Editor's note- At the direction of the Town, the effective date of Ord. 16-16, adopted June 14, 2016, is July 18, 2016. 
17.28.016 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Estes Park, Colorado," dated December 19, 2006, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and FIRM are on file at the Municipal Building, 170 MacGregor Avenue, Estes Park, Colorado. 
(Ord. 8-90 §4, 1990; Ord. 6-07 §1, 2007) 
17.28.017 - Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. 
    Duties of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied. 
(2)  Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. 
(3)  Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of this Chapter are met. 
(4)  Review, approve, or deny all applications for floodplain development permits required by this Chapter. The Floodplain Administrator may delegate signature authority for permitting purposes. 
(Ord. 8-90 §5, 1990; Ord. 15-97, 1997; Ord. No. 16-16 , §1(Exh. A), 6-14-2016) 
Editor's note- At the direction of the Town, the effective date of Ord. 16-16, adopted June 14, 2016, is July 18, 2016. 
17.28.020 - Establishment of districts. 
(a)  There are created and established in the Town the following special zoning districts: 
(1)  FW Floodway District; 
(2)  FF Flood Fringe District. 
(b)  Establishment of floodway criteria. The Town recognizes that designated floodways are administrative limits and tools used to regulate existing and future floodplain developments within its jurisdiction. At such time when floodways are to be delineated through physical map revisions involving local government participation, the Town shall delineate floodways for the revised reaches based on one-half-foot rise criteria. Letters of map revision to existing floodway delineations may continue to use the floodway criteria in place at the time of the existing floodway delineation. Until such time that floodways are revised and designated, the Town may continue to regulate its mapped one-foot floodways. For reaches where a transition must be shown to connect new studies to existing studies with different floodway criteria, the transition length shall not exceed two thousand (2,000) feet. 
(c)  The floodway and flood fringe districts shall be special zoning districts which overlay the underlying zoning districts on property designated to be within the floodplain area. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by actual elevation of the ground surface as determined by a Town-approved engineering survey and delineated on the official floodplain zoning maps of the Town. 
(d)  Whenever possible, the provisions of this Chapter shall be interpreted to apply in conjunction with other land use regulations. In the event of conflicts with other provisions of this Code, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.

(Ord. 22-86 §1 Exhibit A (part), 1986; Ord. 7-87 §§15, 16, 17, 1987) 
17.28.105 - Effects of flood mitigation measures and stream alteration activities on regulatory floodplains. 
(a)  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall appropriately consider issues of sediment transport, erosion, deposition and channel migration and properly mitigate potential problems through the project as well as upstream and downstream of any improvement activity. A detailed geomorphological analysis should be considered, when appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design. Project proponents for a mitigation activity must evaluate the residual one-hundred-year floodplain. Proponents are also encouraged to map the five-hundred-year residual floodplain. 
(b)  All public and private flood control structures shall be maintained to ensure that they retain their structural and hydraulic integrity. Annual inspections, including, as appropriate, field surveys of stream cross-sections, shall demonstrate to the Floodplain Administrator that the project features are in satisfactory structural condition, that adequate flow capacity remains available for conveying flood flows and that no encroachment by vegetation, animals, geological processes, such as erosion, deposition or migration, or by human activity, endanger the proper function of the project. If there are any significant problems, as identified within annual inspection reports, the facility or project owner shall notify the Floodplain Administrator within fifteen (15) days of the inspection. The inspections shall be conducted by Town staff for all publicly owned or publicly maintained facilities, and shall be conducted by the property owner or facility owner for all privately owned and maintained facilities. 
(c)  Any stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory floodplain and be in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local floodplain rules, regulations and ordinances. 
(d)  Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a Colorado Professional Engineer or Certified Professional Hydrologist. 
(e)  All activities within the regulatory floodplain performed by federal agencies using local or state funds or by private, local or state entities shall meet all applicable federal, state and local floodplain requirements. 
(f)  Stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the project proponent demonstrates through a floodway analysis and report, sealed by a Colorado Professional Engineer, that there are no adverse floodway impacts resulting from the project. This requirement only applies on stream reaches with established base flood elevations. 
(g)  No adverse floodway impact means that there is a 0.00-foot rise in the proposed conditions compared to the existing conditions floodway. Upon completion of any work within a floodway, a floodway no-rise certification shall be submitted by the engineer of record. 
(h)  Whenever a stream alteration activity is known or suspected to increase or decrease the established base flood elevation in excess of 0.3 vertical feet, a letter of map revision showing such changes shall be obtained in order to accurately reflect the proposed changes on FEMA's regulatory floodplain map for the stream reach. The Town is responsible for ensuring that this process is pursued. This Section does not require a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) to be applied for, unless mandated by the Floodplain Administrator. 
(Ord. 14-13 §5, 2013) 
17.28.110 - Design standards; FF flood fringe. 
    All uses permitted in the FF Flood Fringe District shall comply with the following design standard: 
(1)  The use of fill shall be the minimum necessary to comply with the provisions of this Section. When required by the provisions of this Chapter, fill shall be to a point no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the area in question. Such fill shall further extend at such elevation fifteen (15) feet beyond the outer perimeter of any structure erected on such fill. No fill shall be used in such a manner as to restrict the flow capacity of any drainway. 
(2)  The lowest floor of any structure shall be no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. Nonresidential structures may be permitted without being placed on fill, provided that the floodproofing requirements of this Chapter are met. 
(3)  All utility services, including electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designated and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(4)  Anchoring. 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the anchoring provisions of this Title. 
b.  All manufactured homes situated within such parks or subdivisions, and manufactured homes placed in existing manufactured home parks and existing manufactured home subdivisions shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement by providing over-the-top ties and frame ties to ground anchors. All components of the anchoring system shall be capable of carrying a force of four thousand eight hundred (4,800) pounds per square inch. All additions to any manufactured home shall also be anchored. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. The following is the minimum anchoring system required: 
1.  There shall be provided over-the-top ties at each of the four (4) corners of the manufactured home, with two (2) additional ties on each long side at intermediate locations, except that manufactured homes less than fifty (50) feet long shall be provided with one (1) such additional tie. 
2.  There shall be provided frame ties at each of the four (4) corners of the manufactured home, with five (5) additional ties per long side at intermediate points, except that manufactured homes less than fifty (50) feet long shall have four (4) additional ties per long side. 
c.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency Manual (FEMA #85) "Manufactured Home Installation for Flood Hazard Areas" should also be consulted for guidance on suggested elevation and anchoring techniques.

2.  The NONC does not constitute final action. 
3.  The NONC shall identify the regulation or policy subject to Town jurisdiction allegedly violated and the facts alleged to constitute the violation. The NONC may propose appropriate corrective action and suggested corrective actions, if any, that the Floodplain Administrator elects to require. 
(2)  The Town shall support these regulations through its National Flood Insurance Program activities. This support will include the existing ability for the Floodplain Administrator to file sanctions upon a property owner for non-compliance. 
(Ord. 14-13 §6, 2013) 
17.28.160 - Appeals. 
    Appeals to the Board of Appeals specified in the adopted building code may be taken by any person aggrieved by his or her inability to obtain a building permit in the FW Floodway or FF Flood Fringe zones or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the Town. Upon review, the Board of Appeals shall have jurisdiction only over the following matters: 
(1)  To review the exact zoning district boundary of the FW Floodway or FF Flood Fringe district as it relates to any specific piece of property; 
(2)  To determine the suitability and advisability of alternate methods of construction. Such determination shall not reduce the capacity of the structure involved to withstand flood damage, nor shall any alternate methods restrict the flow capacity of the main channel or any drainage relative to such channel; 
(3)  In appropriate cases, the Board of Appeals specified in the adopted building code may issue a variance from provisions of this regulation only after making a specific finding that the variance will not endanger the health, welfare and safety of the applicant, or any upstream or downstream owner or occupier of land. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to effect relief. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood protection elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  No variance shall be granted within the regulatory floodway if the base flood level will be increased. 
(5)  Request for a variance to any of these regulations may be considered by the Town, provided that the entity or individual requesting the variance has submitted a written request to the Floodplain Administrator. A notice of the request must be provided to any adjacent communities that would be affected by the variance. 
(6)  The request for a variance shall identify: 
a.  The regulations from which the variance is requested; 
b.  The communities that would be affected by the variance; 
c.  The reasons why the rule cannot be complied with; 
d.  The estimated difference in water surface elevations, flood velocities and flood boundaries that would result if the requested variance were granted than if the calculations were made through strict compliance with the regulations; 
e.  The estimated number of people and structures that will be impacted by the granting of the variance; and 
f.  Any other evidence submitted by the Town, the CWCB or other party of interest. 
(7)  Variances may be issued if it can be determined that: 
a.  There is a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and 
c.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the community or the requestor and that the hardship is not the community's or requestor's own making; and 
d.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased vulnerability to flood losses, additional threats to public safety and welfare, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, hide information of significant interest to the public or conflict with existing local laws or regulations. 
(8)  Variance requests shall be processed as follows: 
a.  The Town shall render, confirm, modify or reject all variance requests pertaining to these regulations. 
b.  The CWCB may review local variance decisions on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the overall intent and spirit of these rules are properly considered at the local level. 
c.  Informal variance determination requests may be presented to CWCB staff in order to guide community officials or project applicants as to whether a formal variance would be needed on a case-by-case basis. 
(Ord. 22-86 §1 Exhibit A (part), 1986; Ord. 8-90 §6, 1990; Ord. 14-13 §7, 2013) 
17.28.170 - Nonliability of the Town. 
(a)  The degree of flood protection provided by the terms of this Chapter is, after considering numerous relevant factors, considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. Floods of greater magnitude may occur and flood heights may be increased as a result of natural or man-made causes. Further, provisions of this Chapter do not imply that areas outside the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard, or that land uses permitted within the area of special flood hazard, are free from flooding or flood damage. 
(b)  The grant of approval by the Town under the regulations as contained in this Chapter shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature by the Town, or by any officer, board member or employee, of the practicability or safety of any structures, building or other proposed use; and shall create no liability upon or cause of action against such public body, officer, board member or employee of the Town for any damages, from flood or otherwise, that may result from such use.

Estes Valley Development Code 
_____
Town of Estes Park
Larimer County 
Adopted November 3, 1999 
Effective February 1, 2000 
Beginning with Supp. No. 14,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
 
SUPPLEMENTATION 
The Estes Valley Development Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained. 
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement number, date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last. 
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all supplemented pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed behind the Supplementation tab and before this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included. It is recommended that the removed pages be filed away for future reference. 
The maintenance of a Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the Code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the developmental legislation of the Town and County. 
MUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION  
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
§ 1.1 - Title 
The regulations of this Land Development Code shall be officially known and cited as the "Land Development Code of the Estes Valley, including the Town of Estes Park, Colorado," although it may be referred to hereafter as the "Estes Valley Development Code," EVDC" or "this Code."  
§ 1.2 - Authority 
This Code is authorized by the Colorado Constitution and the applicable laws and statutes of the State of Colorado.  
§ 1.3 - Purpose and Intent 
The regulations of this Code are intended to implement the 1996 Estes Valley Comprehensive Plan, as amended, and more specifically are intended to: 
A.  Provide for coordinated, harmonious development of the Estes Valley and the Town of Estes Park, which will, in accordance with present and future needs, best promote health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development; 
B.  Protect residents from fire, floodwaters, geologic hazards and other dangers; 
C.  Preserve and protect existing trees and vegetation, agricultural lands, floodplains, riparian corridors, wildlife habitat and other sensitive environmental areas from adverse impacts of development; 
D.  Facilitate the economic provision of adequate public facilities such as transportation, water supply, sewage disposal, drainage, electricity, public schools, parks and other public services and requirements; 
E.  Coordinate transportation and land use planning to provide a safe and efficient transportation system in the Estes Valley; 
F.  Work to improve the aesthetics and design of all primary gateways to the Town of Estes Park, including but not limited to Highways 7, 34 and 36; 
G.  Encourage innovative residential development so that growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type, design and layout of dwellings, and by conservation and more efficient use of open areas ancillary to such dwellings; 
H.  Encourage nonresidential development that preserves and protects the character of the community, including its natural and cultural landscape, and that minimizes objectionable noise, glare, odor, traffic and other impacts of such development, especially when adjacent to residential uses or to the historic downtown core; 
I.  Preserve and protect the architecture, history and small-town character of Estes Park's historic downtown; 
J.  Strengthen and improve the downtown Estes Park as the primary government, cultural, office, financial, tourist, specialty shopping and pedestrian district of the Estes Valley; 
K.  Provide adequate building setbacks and height limitations; 
L.  Encourage orderly and efficient distribution of the Estes Valley's population through land use regulations; 
M.  Promote good civic design and arrangement; and 
N.  Promote higher quality in site and land planning, conservation of open areas, and more efficient and attractive use of open areas.  
§ 1.4 - Applicability 
The provisions of this Code shall apply to: 
A.  All land and development located within the incorporated areas of the Town of Estes Park and all unincorporated areas of Larimer County within the Estes Valley, as depicted in the Estes Valley Development Code Boundary Map, as may be amended from time to time. This map is set forth in Appendix A to this Code and hereby incorporated by reference; and 
B.  Use of all structures and land within the incorporated areas of the Town of Estes Park and all unincorporated areas of Larimer County within the Estes Valley, as depicted on the Estes Valley Development Code Boundary Map (See Appendix A).  
§ 1.5 - Minimum Standards and Compliance 
A.  Minimum Standards. The provisions of this Code shall be considered the minimum requirements necessary for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity and general welfare. 
B.  Compliance. No structure or premises shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no structure or portion thereof shall be erected, moved, constructed, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered contrary to the provisions of this Code. No portion of a lot area, open area, off-street parking space or yard required about or in connection with any building for the purposes of complying with this Code may be included as a portion of a lot area, an open area, off-street parking area or yard similarly required for any other building or its use except as provided under Chapter 9, "Planned Unit Developments." 
C.  Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots. See Chapter 6 for regulations regarding nonconforming uses, structures and lots.  
§ 1.6 - Rules of Construction and Interpretation 
A.  Meaning and Intent. All provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this Code shall be construed according to this Code's stated purpose and intent. 
B.  Text Controls. In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text of this Code and any heading, drawing, table or figure, the text shall control. 
C.  Computation of Time. Unless the terms of a specific provision state otherwise (e.g., some provisions specify " working days"), periods of time defined by a number of days shall mean a number of consecutive calendar days, including all weekend days, holidays and other nonbusiness/working days; however, if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, that day shall be excluded. 
D.  Delegation of Authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department or another officer or employee of the Town or County to perform an act or duty, that provision shall be construed as authorizing the department head or officer to delegate the responsibility to subordinates, unless the terms of the provision specify otherwise. 
E.  Technical and Nontechnical Words. Words and phrases not otherwise defined in this Code shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language, but technical words and phrases not otherwise defined in this Code that may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning. 
F.  Mandatory and Discretionary Terms. The word "shall" is always mandatory, and the words "may" or "should" are always permissive. 
G.  Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly suggests the contrary, conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows: 
1.  "And" indicates that all connected items, conditions, provisions or events shall apply; and 
2.  "Or" indicates that one (1) or more of the connected items, conditions, provisions or events shall apply. 
H.  Tense and Usage. Words used in one (1) tense (past, present or future) include all other tenses, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary. The singular shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular. 
I.  Gender. The masculine shall include the feminine, and vice versa.  
§ 1.7 - Official Zoning Map 
A.  Official Zoning Map. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts designated in Chapter 4 are hereby established as shown on the map entitled "Zoning District Map of the Estes Valley," and hereafter referred to as the Official Zoning Map, as may be amended. 
B.  Incorporated by Reference. The Official Zoning Map and all the notations thereon are hereby incorporated by reference and made part of this Code. The signed copy of the Official Zoning Map containing the zoning districts designated at the time of the adoption of this Code, and all amendments thereto, shall be maintained on file in the office of the Town of Estes Park Director of Community Development. In case of any dispute regarding the zoning classification of property subject to this Code, this original map shall control. (See also Chapter 3.) 
C.  Zoning District Boundaries. Unless otherwise specified, district boundaries are lot lines or the centerline of streets, rivers or such lines extended. For example, where a lot located at the boundary between two (2) zoning districts abuts a street or road, the zoning district boundary shall be the centerline of such abutting street or road. 
D.  Changes to Map. Changes made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Code. Changes shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the Board of Trustees or Board of County Commissioners. No amendment to this Code that changes the Official Zoning Map shall become effective until after such change is entered on the map. 
E.  Omitted Land. If any land subject to this Code has not been specifically included within any of the zoning districts shown on the official zoning map, such land shall automatically be classified in the RE Rural Estate zoning district.  
§ 1.8 - Conflicting Provisions and Relationship to Other Regulations, Codes and Ordinances 
A.  Conflicts and Relationship with Other Regulations.   
1.  When the provisions of this Code are inconsistent with one another, or when the provisions of this Code conflict with provisions found in other ordinances, codes or regulations adopted by the Town of Estes Park or Larimer County, the more restrictive provision shall govern unless the terms of the provisions specify otherwise. 
2.  It shall be the developer's or applicant's responsibility to determine and comply with all other applicable town, county, State or Federal codes or regulations governing land development and land use activities. 
B.  Relationship with Private-Party Easements, Covenants or Agreements. This Code is not intended to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or agreements between parties, provided that wherever this Code proposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or land, upon the location or height of buildings or structures, or upon requirements for open areas than those that are imposed or required by such easements, covenants or agreements between parties, the provision of this Code shall govern. 
In no case shall the Town or County be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements, covenants or agreements between private parties.  
§ 1.9 - Rules of Measurement 
A.  Lot Area Measurement. Lot area refers to the total gross amount of horizontal land area within lot lines. Public and private rights-of-way and streets shall not be included in calculating lot area. No development plan, subdivision approval, building permit or other land use approval shall be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot area requirements of this Code, except as may be otherwise allowed in this Code. See Figure 1-1. 
B.  Lot Width Measurement. Lot width refers to the horizontal distance between the side lot lines as measured along a straight line parallel to the front lot line or the chord thereof. The minimum lot width shall be measured between the side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the front lot line and located the minimum front setback distance from the front lot line. Lot width standards shall apply to lots that do not have a front lot line, i.e., lots that do not abut a street. In these cases, the Decision-Making Body shall determine where to measure lot width. See Figure 1-1. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
 
Figure 1-1
C.  Density Calculation.   
1.  Net Land Area. Net land area shall be determined by subtracting from the gross land area, the following (as applicable): 
a.  Eighty percent (80%) of lands located in the 100-year floodplain; 
b.  Eighty percent (80%) of lands located above the elevation serviceable by the Town of Estes Park water system; 
c.  All lands within private streets or dedicated public rights-of-way; and 
d.  All lands subject to a ground lease that, because of the lease terms, would not be available for development of the proposed land use(s) on the subject property. 
2.  Net Density. Net density shall be calculated by dividing the net land area by the minimum lot area or land area required for each unit. 
3.  When applying a density standard to a parcel's net land area, any fraction of less than one-half (½) shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of one-half (½) or more shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
(Ord. 11-16, §1) 
4.  The number of dwelling or accommodation units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards shall be met. The maximum density established for a zoning district (see Chapter 4) is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a valid justification for varying other dimensional or development standards. 
D.  SetbacksBuilding and Structure Setbacks.   
1.  Building and Structure Setbacks from Lot Lines.   
a.  Measurement : Setbacks shall be measured as the distance between the nearest lot line and the furthermost projection of a building or structure along a line at right angles to the setback line. Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as otherwise specifically allowed in this Section. See Figure 1-2.

CHAPTER 3. - REVIEW PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS 
 
§ 3.1 - General Provisions 
The following general provisions shall apply to all applications under this Code: 
A.  Authority to File Applications. An application for development review or approval under this Code shall be filed by the record owner(s). The Boards or the EVPC may initiate Code amendment action under this Code with or without an application from property owner(s) who may be affected. 
B.  Applications. Applications required under this Chapter shall be submitted on forms provided by the Staff in such numbers as required by the Staff. Applications shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee established by the Boards to defray the costs of processing applications and by any required escrow funds. 
C.  Incomplete Applications or Insufficient Fees. Applications shall be reviewed for completeness within eight (8) working days of filing. If the Staff determines that the application is complete, the application shall then be processed. If the Staff determines that it is incomplete, they shall return the application to the Applicant as incomplete and specify the specific ways in which the application is deficient. No further processing of the incomplete application shall occur until the deficiencies are corrected. Any application that is not accompanied by the required fee shall be found incomplete. Fees shall not be required with applications initiated by the Staff, Planning Commission or Boards. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
D.  Required Times for Action and Inaction.   
1.  General RuleDeemed Denial. Except as set forth in subsections D.2 and D.4 below, whenever the provisions of this Chapter require that reviewers or the Decision-Making Body take action on an application within a specified period of time and such action is not taken within that time limit or within a permitted extension of such time limit, such inaction shall be deemed a denial of the application unless the Applicant agrees to an extension of the time period. 
2.  ExceptionsSubdivisions and Planned Unit DevelopmentsDeemed Approval. Failure of the reviewers or Decision-Making Body to take action on a subdivision or PUD application within any time frame required by this Chapter, or other time frame agreed to by the Applicant at the time of the application filing or during the application's review, shall be deemed an approval of the application unless the Applicant agrees to an extension of the time period in writing. 
3.  Extensions of Time Periods for Review. Except as set forth in subsection D.4 below, reviewers or the Decision-Making Body shall have the discretion to extend the time periods set forth in this Chapter up to a maximum of sixty (60) days without consent of the Applicant, for review and final decision on a development application. Such extension shall be allowed when the projected size, complexity, anticipated impacts or other factors associated with the proposed development clearly justify such extension of time. 
4.  Extensions of Time Periods for ReviewSubdivisions and Planned Unit Developments. Time frames for action on a subdivision or PUD application may be extended by the reviewers or Decision-Making Body when necessary to receive recommendations or reports from a reviewing agency, but no such extension shall exceed thirty (30) days unless the reviewing agency notifies the reviewer or Decision-Making Body that it needs more time to complete its recommendation. All other extensions of the time periods set forth in this Chapter for review and action on subdivision or PUD applications may be extended by the reviewers or Decision-Making Body only if the Applicant agrees in writing to an extension of time. 
E.  Concurrent Submittal and Timing of Reviews. At the election of the Applicant and with the approval of the Staff, applications for different types of development approvals may be processed concurrently to expedite total review and processing time for a project. 
(Ord. 08-14 §1; Ord. 21-16 §1) 
F.  Application Processing Schedule. The Staff may promulgate a processing schedule for each application. 
G.  Permitted Scope of Action by Decision-Makers. The Decision-Making Body holding the public meeting or hearing may approve the application, approve the application with conditions or deny the application. 
H.  Continuation of Hearings. A public hearing may be continued to a later date without again complying with the notice requirements of this Chapter, provided that the continued hearing is set for a specific date and time. No public hearing on a subdivision or planned unit development application shall be continued for more than forty (40) days without the written consent of the Applicant. 
I.  Submittal Requirements.   
1.  General. Submittal requirements for each type of development application are set forth in Appendix B to this Code. 
2.  Waivers Pursuant to Pre-Application Meetings. At or following a pre-application conference, Staff may waive certain submittal requirements set forth in Appendix B to this Code in order to reduce the burden on the Applicant and to tailor the requirements to the information necessary to review a particular application. Staff may waive such requirements where it finds that the projected size, complexity, anticipated impacts or other factors associated with the proposed development or subdivision clearly justify such waiver. This discretion may only be exercised if a pre-application conference is held. 
J.  Modifications and Amendments.   
1.  Minor Modifications to Approved Plans/Plats. Minor modifications of approved development plans and subdivision plats may be authorized by Staff pursuant to §3.7, "Minor Modifications," below. 
2.  Amendments to Approved Plans/Plats. Any change or modification to an approved development plan or subdivision plat that does not qualify as a minor modification pursuant to this Chapter shall be submitted as a new application for approval of a plan/plat and shall follow the applicable procedures as set forth in this Chapter. 
(Ord. 8-05 §1, 6/14/05; Ord. 08-14 §1, 3/25/14; ; Ord. 21-16 §1(Exh. A), 8/23/16)

Step 1 	Pre-Application Conference 
Step 2 	Neighborhood and Community Meeting 
Step 3 	Application/Completeness Certification 
Step 4 	Staff Review and Report 
Step 5 	Estes Valley Planning Commission Action or Recommendation 
Step 6 	Board of Trustees/Board of County Commissioners Review and Action 
 
(Ord. 15-18 §1(Exh. A)) 
A.  Step 1: Pre-Application Conference.   
1.  Purpose. The purposes of the pre-application conference are to provide an opportunity for the Applicant and the Staff to discuss the review process schedule and submittal requirements, the scope of the project and compliance with this Code. 
2.  Applicability. A pre-application conference is mandatory for the following applications: 
a.  Special review uses; 
b.  Development plans; 
c.  Rezoning applications; 
d.  Preliminary subdivision plat; 
e.  Preliminary PUD plans; 
f.  Variances; 
g.  Minor subdivisions; and 
h.  Annexations. 
Staff may waive the pre-application conference on the ground that the proposed development is not complex and will not have any significant impacts on services, roads, natural resources or adjacent property. 
(Ord. 18-02 #2) 
3.  Scheduling. The pre-application conference shall be scheduled by the Applicant with Staff at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of submission of any related application. 
4.  Submittal Requirements. All Applicants shall submit a sketch plan to the Staff for review no later than five (5) days prior to the scheduled pre-application conference. See Appendix B to this Code for sketch plan submittal requirements. 
B.  Step 2: Neighborhood and Community Meeting.   
1.  Purpose. The purpose of the neighborhood and community meeting is to educate occupants and owners of nearby lands about the proposed development and application, receive comments, address concerns about the development proposal, and resolve conflicts and outstanding issues, where possible. 
a.  Favored Practice. Neighborhood and community meetings are encouraged as opportunities for informal communication between owners and occupants of nearby lands, applicants and other residents who may be affected by development proposals. 
b.  Applicability. Except as provided otherwise in §3.2.G (Summary Table-Standard Development Review Process by Application Type), neighborhood and community meetings shall be mandatory for zoning and planning projects that require a public hearing as specified in this Code. Except as provide otherwise in §3.2.G (Summary Table-Standard Development Review Process by Application Type), neighborhood and community meetings shall be voluntary for zoning and planning projects that do not require a public hearing as specified in this Code. 
c.  Procedure. If a neighborhood and community meeting is held by the applicant, it shall generally comply with the following procedures: 
(1)  Time and Place. The neighborhood and community meeting shall be held at a place that is generally accessible to neighbors that own and/or reside in the notification area to the land subject to the application. It shall be scheduled after 5:00 p.m. on a weekday or at any time on a weekend day. 
(2)  Written Notification. The applicant shall provide notification of the neighborhood and community meeting a minimum of ten (10) business days in advance of the meeting by placing notice in a newspaper or display advertising of general circulation in the Estes Valley and by mailing notice to all owners and occupants within the notification boundary of the land subject to the application. The list of owners within the notification area of the affected property shall be obtained by the applicant from the most recent version of the property owners of record provided by The Town of Estes Park. The notification shall state the time and place of the meeting. 
(3)  Posted Notices of Neighborhood and Community Meeting. Required posted notice requirements shall be on a standard sign with format and material as determined by the Planning Department. The following additional requirements shall apply to posted notices pursuant to this Section: 
a)  Any posted notice shall be legible from a public street or public right-of-way in clear weather conditions. "Legible" is defined as meeting the legibility requirements in the Estes Park Municipal Code Chapter 17.66 (Signs). 
b)  Projects abutting more than one public street or public right-of-way shall be required to post one (1) additional sign for each abutting public street or public right-of-way. 
c)  Posting of all notice(s) required by this Section shall take place no later than ten (10) days prior to any given neighborhood and community meeting for which the posting is required, and the posted signage shall remain until the close of any such neighborhood and community meeting, including the closing dates of any neighborhood and community meeting that may be continued or postponed. 
d)  Proof that the required signage was posted in accord with this Section shall be provided to the Planning Department prior to the opening of any neighborhood and community meeting. A date-stamped photograph of the posted notice in context shall be deemed adequate proof for purposes of this Section. 
e)  Removal, damage or destruction of a properly posted notice by weather or other natural occurrence shall not be construed as failure to comply with the public notice provisions of this Code. 
(4)  Conduct of Meetings. At the neighborhood and community meeting, the applicant shall explain the development proposal and application, inform attendees of the character and nature of the process for review, and respond to comments and questions neighbors may have about the application and propose ways to resolve conflicts. 
(5)  Staff Attendance. Town staff may attend the neighborhood and community meeting for the purpose of advising the attendees regarding applicable provisions of the Development Code, but shall not serve as facilitators or become involved in negotiations at the neighborhood meeting. 
(6)  Written Summary of Neighborhood and Community Record of Meeting. The applicant shall provide the Planning Department a written summary of the neighborhood and community meeting. The written summary shall include a list of those in attendance, a summary of the issues related to the development proposal discussed, comments by those in attendance about the development proposal, and any other information the applicant deems appropriate. The written summary of the neighborhood and community meeting shall be included with the application materials, and be made available to the public for inspection. 
(7)  Response to Summary. Any party in attendance at the neighborhood and community meeting may submit an additional written summary indicating their understanding of the issues related to the development proposal discussed, comments by those in attendance about the development proposal, and any other information they deem appropriate. This written summary may include a response to the applicant's written summary of the neighborhood meeting. 
Neighborhood and community meetings are optional for any other applications not requiring a public hearing.

C.  Step 3: Application Timing and Certification of Completeness.   
1.  Except for variances, all development applications shall be submitted to Staff a minimum of fifty-five (55) days prior to the next regularly scheduled EVPC meeting at which the application will be reviewed. See §3.6 regarding variances. Staff shall have the discretion to shorten submittal time frames. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
2.  Within eight (8) working days of submittal, the Staff shall either certify the application as complete and in compliance with all submittal requirements or reject it as incomplete and notify the Applicant of any deficiencies. See §3.1.C above. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1; Ord. 15-18 §1(Exh. A)) 
D.  Step 4: Staff Review and Report. No later than fourteen (14) days prior to EVPC meeting, Staff shall refer the development application to the appropriate review agencies, review the development application and prepare a staff report. No changes to the development application or any accompanying plans or information shall be permitted after submittal, except for any changes or additional information requested by the Staff during their review. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1; Ord. 15-18 §1(Exh. A)) 
E.  Step 5: Estes Valley Planning Commission Action or Recommendation.   
1.  Public Hearings or Meetings Required.

b.  Authority to Hold Application for Later EVPC Review . Notwithstanding the time for action requirements set forth in subsection 1.a above, whenever an extraordinary number of applications are submitted, such that the Staff is unable to complete their review adequately prior to the next regularly scheduled EVPC meeting, the Staff shall be authorized to hold an application until the next subsequent processing period for EVPC review. Once the application is placed on the official agenda for a public meeting or hearing before the EVPC, all other time requirements for review pursuant to this Section and Chapter shall apply. 
2.  Compliance with EVPC's Conditional Approvals.   
a.  EVPC Final Actions . When the EVPC is the Decision-Making Body, approval of an application shall not become final and appealable until all conditions of approval have been complied with.

All applications seeking to amend this Code to allow a change from one (1) zone district to a different zone district or seeking to amend this Code by changing the permitted uses in any zone district shall be accompanied by a development plan. This requirement may be waived by Staff if it finds that the projected size, complexity, anticipated impacts or other factors associated with the proposed development or subdivision clearly justify such waiver. 
2.  Contents of Development Plan. See Appendix B to this Code for submittal requirements. 
3.  Within one (1) year from the effective date of this Code, any property owner may apply for rezoning on the basis that an error in the original zoning was made. Staff may waive the development plan requirements based upon the nature of the proposed request. Applicant must submit a statement of request setting forth information, data and reasons why the error exists. 
C.  Procedures for Approval. All applications for text or Official Zoning Map amendments shall follow the standard development approval process set forth in §3.2 of this Chapter. 
D.  Standards for Review. All applications for text or Official Zoning Map amendments shall be reviewed by the EVPC and Board(s) for compliance with the relevant standards and criteria set forth below and with other applicable provisions of this Code. 
1.  The amendment is necessary to address changes in conditions in the areas affected; 
2.  The development plan, which the proposed amendment to this Code would allow, is compatible and consistent with the policies and intent of the Comprehensive Plan and with existing growth and development patterns in the Estes Valley; and 
3.  The Town, County or other relevant service providers shall have the ability to provide adequate services and facilities that might be required if the application were approved. 
E.  Effect of Approvals and Lapse. When a development plan is required by this Section, if an Applicant fails to either apply for a building permit or commence operation with regard to the rezoning approval consistent with such development plan within three (3) years from the effective date of the amendment, such development plan shall automatically lapse and become null and void. In the event a development plan has lapsed, the Board, at its discretion, may institute rezoning proceedings pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in this Section to rezone the affected land areas. 
(Ord. 07-14 §1) 
F.  Applications for Building Permits During Consideration of Application for Amendment to this Code.   
1.  Whenever an ordinance or resolution has been introduced before the Boards that involves a change in zoning from a less restricted district to a more restricted district, or to set forth prohibited uses in any existing zone district, no building permit shall be issued for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the introduction of such zoning amendment when such building permit would authorize the construction of a building or the establishment of a use that would become nonconforming under the contemplated zoning amendment. 
2.  If such ordinance or resolution is not adopted within one hundred twenty (120) days, the appropriate public entity is authorized to accept applications and issue building permits regardless of the pendency of such amendment. 
(Ord. 07-14 §1, 2/25/14)  
§ 3.4 - Planned Unit Developments 
A.  Applicability. Planned Unit Developments may be approved in any zoning district in which this Code expressly permits such projects (See Chapter 9), subject to the standards set forth in this Code and the approval procedures set forth in this Section. 
B.  Consolidation with Subdivision Approval. Where applicable, the Applicant shall consolidate an application for Preliminary PUD Plan approval with an application for preliminary subdivision plan approval, and shall consolidate an application for Final PUD Plan approval with an application for final subdivision plat approval. Such consolidated application shall be submitted in a form that satisfies both the planned unit development requirements of this Code and the provisions, including submittal requirements, governing subdivisions. 
C.  Procedures for Approval of a PUD Plan. The PUD is first approved in preliminary form and then approved in final form. Approval of preliminary and final Planned Unit Development plans shall follow the same procedures as approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats . See §3.9 below for the subdivision approval process. 
D.  Standards for Review. All applications for Planned Unit Developments shall demonstrate compliance with the requirements and review standards set forth below and in Chapter 9, "Planned Unit Developments," and with all other applicable provisions of this Code. 
1.  Preliminary PUDs. An application for approval of a Preliminary PUD Plan, together with submitted plans and reports, shall be reviewed for conformance with the following standards: 
a.  The PUD shall be consistent with and implement the planning goals, policies and objectives as contained in this Code and in the Comprehensive Plan; 
b.  Adverse impacts on adjacent properties, including but not limited to traffic, noise and visual impacts, shall be mitigated to the maximum extent feasible; 
c.  The PUD shall be integrated with adjacent development through street connections, sidewalks, trails and similar features; 
d.  Except as provided in Chapter 9 below, all district, development and subdivision standards set forth in Chapters 4 (Zoning Districts), 7 (General Development Standards) and 10 (Subdivision Standards) shall be met; and 
e.  As allowed in Chapter 9 below, certain standards may be modified or varied upon a finding that the proposed PUD incorporates creative site design such that it represents an improvement in quality over what could have been accomplished through strict application of the otherwise applicable district or development standards, including but not limited to improvements in open space provision and access; environmental protection; tree/vegetation preservation; efficient provision of streets, roads and other utilities and services; or choice of living and housing environments. 
2.  Standards for Review for a Final PUD Plan. A Final PUD Plan application, together with all submitted plans and reports, shall be reviewed to determine their compliance with the approved preliminary PUD plan, including all recommended conditions. 
E.  Effect of Approvals.   
1.  Effect of Approval of a Preliminary PUD Plan. The provisions set forth in §3.9.F below applicable to a preliminary subdivision plan shall apply to a preliminary PUD plan. 
2.  Effect of Approval of a Final PUD Plan. The provisions set forth in §3.9.F below applicable to a final subdivision plat shall apply to a final PUD plan. A final PUD plan shall be recorded as the final subdivision plat, as per §3.9.F below.  
§ 3.5 - Special Review Uses 
A.  Procedures for Approval of Special Review Uses. Applications for approval of a special review use shall follow the standard development approval process set forth in §3.2 of this Chapter. Uses that require a Special Review and are subject to the regulations of this section are stated in the use tables Table 4-1: Permitted Uses: Residential Zoning Districts and Table 4-4: Permitted Uses: Nonresidential Zoning Districts. 
Special Review Uses shall be reviewed through an S1 or S2 procedure. Those uses that have a wider public interest or impact shall be reviewed through the S2 procedure. Both review procedures provide an opportunity to allow the use when there are minimal impacts, to allow the use but impose mitigation measure to address identified concerns, or to deny the use if findings establish that concerns cannot be resolved. 
Approval of a Special Review Use shall not constitute a change in the base zoning district and shall be granted only for the specific use approved at the specific site. Approval is subject to such modifications, conditions, and restrictions as may be deemed appropriate by the Decision Making Body. 
B.  Standards for Review. All applications for a special review use shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable criteria and standards set forth in Chapter 5, "Use Regulations," of this Code. 
Applications for S1 or S2 Special Review shall provide a narrative that describes how the proposed use fulfills the applicable requirements and standards for the use. In order to minimize adverse impacts of the proposed use, an approval of Special Review Use may be conditioned based upon information provided in the narrative and staff findings. 
For purposes of the Special Review, the narrative shall describe the following, as applicable: 
1.  The proposed use and its operations; 
2.  Traffic generation including a traffic impact study if determined necessary by the Decision-Making Body; 
3.  Existing zoning compatibility; 
4.  Location of parking and loading, including size, location, screening, drainage, landscaping, and surfacing; 
5.  Effect on off-site parking; 
6.  Street access points, including size, number, location and/or design; 
7.  Hours of operation, including when certain activities are proposed to occur; 
8.  Exterior lighting; 
9.  Effects on air and water quality; 
10.  Environmental effects which may disturb neighboring property owners such as; 
a.  Glare. This may be described in terms of location, design, intensity and shielding; 
b.  Noise; and 
c.  Dust; 
11.  Height, size, setback, and location of buildings and activities; 
12.  Any diking, berms, screening or landscaping, and standards for their installation and maintenance; and 
13.  Other resources. This description shall include information on protection and preservation of existing trees, vegetation, water resources, habitat areas, drainage areas, historic resources, cultural resources, or other significant natural resources. 
(Ord. 05-18 §1(Exh. A)) 
C.  Lapse.   
1.  Failure of an Applicant to apply for a building permit or commence operation with regard to the special review use approval within three (3) years of the approval of special review shall automatically render the decision null and void unless a longer period is approved by the decision-making body as a condition of approval. 
2.  If a legally established special review use is abandoned or discontinued for a period of three (3) consecutive years or more, then the decision originally approving such special review use shall automatically lapse and be null and void, unless a longer period is approved by the decision-making body as a condition of approval. 
3.  Prior to the end of the lapse period set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2 above, the owner of the property receiving special review use approval may seek an extension of the lapse period for an additional two (2) years by petitioning either the Board of Trustees or the Board of County Commissioners for an extension of two (2) years. Said petition shall be filed prior to the expiration of the lapse period and shall set forth reasons why the project will be commenced within the requested two-year period. The decision on any extension shall be at the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees or the Board of County Commissioners. No additional extension of the additional two-year lapse period shall be granted, except in connection with a new Special Review application and review. 
(Ord. 07-14 §2; Ord. 17-17 §1) 
(Ord. 07-14 §2, 2/25/14; Ord. 17-17 §1(Exh. D), 6/13/17; Ord. 05-18 §1(Exh. A), 4/10/18)  
§ 3.6 - Variances 
A.  Applicability. The BOA shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of this Code inflict unnecessary hardship and practical difficulties upon the Applicant. 
B.  Procedure for Approval of Variances. Applications for approval of variances shall follow the standard development approval process set forth in §3.2 of this Chapter, except for the following modifications: 
1.  Step 2: Application Timing. Applications for variances shall be submitted to Staff a minimum of forty-two (42) days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the BOA. Staff shall have the discretion to shorten submittal timeframes. 
(Ord. 8-05 §1) 
2.  Step 4: Review and Action by the BOA. The staff report on an application for a variance shall be forwarded to the BOA. The BOA shall review the application, staff report and public meeting testimony and take final action by either approving, approving with conditions or denying such application. The BOA's decision on the application shall be final. 
C.  Standards for Review. All applications for variances shall demonstrate compliance with the standards and criteria set forth below: 
1.  Special circumstances or conditions exist (e.g., exceptional topographic conditions, narrowness, shallowness or the shape of the property) that are not common to other areas or buildings similarly situated and practical difficulty may result from strict compliance with this Code's standards, provided that the requested variance will not have the effect of nullifying or impairing the intent and purposes of either the specific standards, this Code or the Comprehensive Plan. 
2.  In determining "practical difficulty," the BOA shall consider the following factors: 
a.  Whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance; 
b.  Whether the variance is substantial; 
c.  Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as a result of the variance; 
d.  Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of public services such as water and sewer; 
e.  Whether the Applicant purchased the property with knowledge of the requirement; and 
f.  Whether the Applicant's predicament can be mitigated through some method other than a variance. 
3.  No variance shall be granted if the submitted conditions or circumstances affecting the Applicant's property are of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situations. 
4.  No variance shall be granted reducing the size of lots contained in an existing or proposed subdivision if it will result in an increase in the number of lots beyond the number otherwise permitted for the total subdivision, pursuant to the applicable zone district regulations. 
5.  If authorized, a variance shall represent the least deviation from the regulations that will afford relief. 
6.  Under no circumstances shall the BOA grant a variance to allow a use not permitted, or a use expressly or by implication prohibited under the terms of this Code for the zone district containing the property for which the variance is sought. 
7.  In granting such variances, the BOA may require such conditions as will, in its independent judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standard so varied or modified. 
D.  Lapse. Failure of an Applicant to apply for a building permit and commence construction or action with regard to the variance approval within one (1) year of receiving approval of the variance shall automatically render the decision of the BOA null and void. However, variances associated with an approved development plan or special review application shall become null and void upon the lapse or expiration of the approval of the development plan or special review.

B.  Applicability. All subdivisions shall be subject to the approval procedures set forth in this Section. 
C.  Procedure for Approval of Subdivisions (Except Minor Subdivisions)   
1.  General. Subdivisions are approved in two (2) stages: first, a preliminary subdivision plan is approved, and second, a final subdivision plat is approved and recorded. The Board of Trustees or the Board of County Commissioners is the entity with final approval authority for both preliminary and final subdivision plats, depending on the location of the property. 
2.  Procedure for Approval of Preliminary Subdivision Plats. Applications for preliminary subdivision plat approval shall follow the standard development approval process set forth in §3.2 of this Chapter. 
3.  Procedure for Approval of Final Subdivision Plats. Applications for final subdivision plat approval shall follow the standard development approval process set forth in §3.2 of this Chapter, except that Step 4 (EVPC Review and Action) shall not apply. 
D.  Minor Subdivisions.   
1.  Defined. Minor subdivisions shall be defined as follows: 
a.  Frontage Lots . Division of one (1) or more lots, tracts or parcels of land into a total of not more than four (4) lots shall also be a minor subdivision, provided that each resulting lot fronts onto an existing street, and that the subdivision entails no extension of public facilities. No more than a total of four (4) lots shall be created out of a lot, tract or parcel or set of contiguous parcels in the same ownership using the minor subdivision procedure. Frontage Lot subdivisions shall be titled as a "Subdivision." (Ord. 18-01 #8; Ord. 8-05 #1) 
b.  Boundary Adjustments . Division of one (1) or more lots, tracts or parcels of land for the purpose of adjusting boundary lines between such lots, tracts or parcels of land and adjacent lots, tracts or parcels of land, which adjustments do not create additional lots or building sites for any purposes, shall be considered a minor subdivision for review procedure. Boundary Adjustments shall be titled as a "Boundary Line Adjustment" for properties not within a platted subdivision or "Amended Plat" for properties within a platted subdivision. The final map shall clearly indicate the original boundaries of each lot and shall contain the following statement: (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
"Boundary lines indicated on this map are adjustments of former boundary lines of the property depicted hereon. Such adjustments do not create additional lots or building sites for any purposes. The area added to each lot shown hereon by such adjustment is to be considered an addition to, shall become a part of, and shall be conveyed together with, each lot as shown." (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
c.  Land Consolidation Plats . Unplatted contiguous legal lots approved for single-family residential development can be combined with a land consolidation plat. Land Consolidation Plats shall be titled as a "Land Consolidation Plat." The final plat shall clearly indicate the original boundaries of each lot and shall contain the following statement: (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
"Boundary lines indicated on this map are adjustments of former boundary lines of the property depicted hereon. Such adjustments do not create additional lots or building sites for any purposes." (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
2.  Hazard Areas. Except Land Consolidation Plats, areas with geologic hazards as defined by §7.7 of this Code shall not be eligible for the minor subdivision process. 
(Ord. 18-01 #9; Ord. 8-05 #1) 
3.  Procedure for Approval of Minor Subdivisions. Applications for minor subdivision approval shall follow the standard development approval process set forth in §3.2 of this Chapter, except that Land Consolidation Plats shall not be subject to review by the Planning Commission. Land Consolidation Plats shall follow the review timeframe established for Final Plats. 
(Ord. 18-01 #10; Ord. 8-05 #1) 
4.  Submittal Requirements. Boundary Line Adjustments and Amended Plats involving exchange of land shall require deeds describing the resultant parcels, signed and dated by owners, and dated and sealed by a Notary Public, to be submitted with the Mylars. 
(Ord. 18-01 #11; Ord. 8-05 #1) 
5.  Modifications and Waivers. The Community Development Director, or designee, shall have authority to grant modifications and/or waive standards set forth in Chapter 10 in conjunction with a Boundary Adjustment or Land Consolidation Plat. Approval of requested modifications and/or waivers shall require that the Director finds that approval of such modification and/or waiver: (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
a.  Advances the goals and purposes of this Code; (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
b.  Either results in less visual impact, more effective environmental or open space preservation, relieves practical difficulties in developing a site or results in the use of superior engineering standards than those required by this Code; (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
c.  There will be no increase in the intensity of use; and (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
d.  There will be no increase in development and/or demand for services that necessitates compliance with EVDC standards. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
E.  Standards for Review. All subdivision applications shall demonstrate compliance with the standards and criteria set forth in Chapter 10, "Subdivision Standards," and all other applicable provisions of this Code. For minor subdivisions, the EVPC shall also find that approval will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare, injurious to other property in the neighborhood, or in conflict with the purposes and objectives of this Code. 
F.  Effects of Approval.   
1.  Effect of Approval of a Minor Subdivision. Within sixty (60) days of the Board's approval of the minor subdivision, the developer shall submit the minor subdivision final plat for recording. If the minor subdivision plan is not submitted for recording within this sixty-day time period, the approval shall automatically lapse and be null and void. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
2.  Effect of Approval of a Preliminary Subdivision Plan.   
a.  Within twelve (12) months from the date of the final approval of a preliminary subdivision plat, the developer shall submit an application for final subdivision plat for either all or at least one (1) phase of the proposed subdivision. 
b.  An approved final subdivision plat for any phase of the preliminary subdivision plan shall extend the life of the preliminary subdivision plan for an additional twelve-month period from the date the final subdivision plat is approved. If the original twelve-month period or any successive twelve-month period expires before a final subdivision plat is approved, then the preliminary plan approval automatically lapses and becomes null and void. 
c.  During the period in which an approved preliminary subdivision plan is effective, no subsequent change or amendment to this Code or any other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to affect adversely the right of the Applicant to proceed with any aspect of the approved development in accordance with the terms of such preliminary subdivision plat approval. However, the Applicant shall comply with those local laws and regulations adopted subsequent to the approval of such preliminary subdivision if the Estes Valley Planning Commission determines, on the basis of written findings, that compliance is reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare. 
3.  Effect of Approval of a Final Subdivision Plat. Within sixty (60) days from the date of the Board's action on the final subdivision plat, the Applicant shall make all required revisions, if any (see §3.2.E above), and shall submit the final subdivision plat to the Town for recording. If the final plat is not submitted for recording within this sixty-day time period, the approval shall automatically lapse and be null and void.

A.  Purpose. This Section is intended to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., as amended, establishing a vested property right to undertake and complete development and use of real property under the terms and conditions of an approved site specific development plan. 
B.  Site Specific Development Plan Approval.   
1.  Site Specific Development Plan Defined. Final approval of a final subdivision plat (including a minor subdivision plat), final PUD plan, development plan and special review shall be considered approval or conditional approval of a "site specific development plan," as defined in §24-68-101 et seq., C.R.S., and shall result in a vested right for a period of three (3) years as provided in §24-68-101 et seq., C.R.S.   
2.  Hearing Required. No site specific development plan shall be approved until after a public hearing, preceded by written notice of such hearing. Such notice shall be published at the time and in the manner required by §3.15 below, and may be combined with any other required notice. 
3.  Notice of Approval.   
a.  Each map, plat or special review constituting a site specific development plan shall contain the following language: "Approval of this plan creates a vested property right pursuant to Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., as amended." 
b.  In addition, notice describing generally the type and intensity of the use approved, the specific parcel or parcels of property affected, and a statement that a vested property right has been created shall be published once, not more than fourteen (14) days after final approval of the site specific development plan, in a newspaper of general circulation within the Estes Valley. 
4.  Amendments to Site Specific Development Plans. In the event amendments to a site specific development plan are approved pursuant to this Chapter, the effective date of such amendments, for purposes of the duration of a vested property right, shall be the date of the approval of the original site specific development plan, unless the Decision-Making Body specifically finds otherwise and incorporates such finding in its approval of the amendment. 
C.  Other Provisions Unaffected. Approval of a site specific development plan shall not constitute an exemption from or waiver of any other provisions of this Code pertaining to the development and/or use of the property. 
D.  Limitations. Nothing in this Chapter is intended to create any vested property right, but only to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., as amended.

(Ord. 2-11 §1, 1/25/11)  
§ 3.11 - Temporary Uses and Structures 
A.  Applicability. All temporary uses and structures shall obtain a Temporary Use Permit pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section. 
B.  Procedures for Approval of Temporary Uses and Structures. The procedure for an application for a temporary use or structure shall be as follows: 
1.  Step 1: Pre-Application Conference. A pre-application conference is voluntary for temporary use/structure applications. 
2.  Step 2: Staff Review and Action. Within thirty (30) days from the date a complete application is submitted, the Staff shall review the application according to the standards set forth in this Section, and make a final decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny the application. 
C.  Standards for Review. The Staff shall review an application for a temporary use or structure and evaluate it for compliance with the general standards and specific use standards (as applicable) set forth in §5.3, "Temporary Uses and Structures," and in addition all of the following standards: 
1.  The proposed site for the temporary use or structure is adequate in size and shape to accommodate the temporary use; 
2.  The proposed site is adequately served by streets or highways having sufficient width and improvements to accommodate the kind and quantity of traffic that such temporary use will or could reasonably generate; 
3.  Adequate parking to accommodate vehicular traffic to be generated by such use will be available either on-site or at alternate locations; and 
4.  The operation of the requested use at the location proposed and within the time period specified will not jeopardize, endanger or otherwise constitute a menace to the public health, safety or general welfare. 
D.  Conditions of Approval. In approving a Temporary Use Permit, the Staff may impose conditions, including but not limited to control of nuisance factors (e.g., glare, noise, smoke, dust), provision of security and safety measures, and limitations on hours of operation, storage and parking, provided that such conditions are necessary to: 
1.  Achieve the general purposes of this Section and the specific purposes of the zoning district in which the temporary use will be located, or to be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan; 
2.  Protect the public health, safety and general welfare; or 
3.  Ensure operation and maintenance of the temporary use in a manner compatible with existing uses on adjoining properties and in the surrounding area. 
E.  Time Limits on Permits. Temporary Use Permits shall be valid for a specified period of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, unless otherwise expressly provided for in §5.3 of this Code.  
§ 3.12 - Use Classification Requests 
A.  Purpose and Applicability.   
1.  The use classifications set forth in Chapter 4, "Zoning Districts," and defined in Chapter 13, "Definitions," describe one (1) or more uses having similar characteristics, but do not list every use or activity that may appropriately fall within the classification. This Section shall apply to determine all questions or disputes whether a specific use is deemed to be within a use classification permitted in a zoning district. 
2.  The provisions of this Section shall not apply to permit any specific use that is expressly prohibited in a zoning district. 
3.  If, pursuant to this Section, a specific use cannot be clearly determined to be in a use classification permitted in the applicable zoning district, such use may be incorporated into the zoning regulations by a Code Amendment, as provided in §3.3 above. 
B.  Procedures for Use Classification Request. The procedure for an application to determine a use classification shall be as follows: 
1.  Step 1: Pre-Application Conference. A pre-application conference is voluntary for use classification requests. 
2.  Step 2: Staff Review and Action. Within thirty (30) days from the date a complete application is submitted, the Staff shall: (a) review the application according to the standards set forth in this Section; (b) consult with the Town or County Attorneys and other staff, as necessary; and (c) make a final determination as to whether the subject use shall be deemed to be within a use classification set forth in this Code and whether such use should be allowed in the applicable zoning district. 
3.  Appeals. Appeals from the Staff's determination on a use classification request shall be made to the respective Boards. 
4.  Form of Determination. All final determinations by Staff or the Boards shall be provided to the Applicant in writing and shall be filed in the official record of use classification determinations. 
C.  Standards for Review. The following considerations shall be used to determine what classification a use is in and whether it is appropriate to allow such use as a principal use in the applicable zoning district: 
1.  The actual or projected characteristics of the subject use compared to the stated characteristics of each use classification allowed in the zoning district (see §13.2, "Use Classifications/Specific Use Definitions and Examples"); 
2.  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the use; 
3.  Relative amounts of sales from the subject use compared to other permitted uses; 
4.  The relative number of employees in each use; 
5.  Hours of operation; 
6.  Building and site arrangement; 
7.  Vehicles used with the use; 
8.  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; 
9.  Signs expected in conjunction with the use; 
10.  How the use advertises itself; 
11.  Whether the use is likely to be found independent of other uses on the site; 
12.  Any other potential impacts of the subject use relative to other specific uses included in the classification and permitted in the applicable zoning district; and 
13.  Whether the subject use is consistent with the stated intent and purposes of this Code and the zoning district in which it is to be located. 
D.  Official Record of Use Classification Determinations. An official record of use classification determinations shall be kept on file in the office of the Town of Estes Park Community Development Director. The record shall be available for public inspection in the Estes Park Community Development Department during normal business hours.  
§ 3.13 - Public Facility/Use Location and Extent Review 
A.  Purpose. This Section implements §30-28-110(1), C.R.S., and is intended to provide an opportunity for review of the location and extent of specified public facilities and uses sought to be constructed or authorized within the Estes Valley, especially as to whether such public use is consistent with the Estes Valley Comprehensive Plan and this Code. 
B.  Applicability.   
1.  Applicable to Specified Public Uses.   
a.  Location and extent review shall apply to the construction or authorization of all public schools, public safety facilities, trail heads, major utilities (whether publicly or privately owned) and all other public uses not specifically exempt from this Section. These public uses are listed in Chapter 4, "Zoning Districts," (Tables 4-1 and 4-4) with the notation under the "additional regulations" column that Public Facility/Use Location and Extent review may be applicable. 
b.  Location and extent review shall also apply to the acceptance, widening, removal, extension, relocation, narrowing, vacation, abandonment, change of use, or sale, lease or acquisition of any land for any public use subject to this Section. 
2.  Exemption for Town Public Uses Located Within Town Limits. Location and extent review shall not apply to any public road, park, trail, public street, way, ground, space or utility, or any other public facility or use other than a public building or structure, that is to be constructed, financed or owned by the Town of Estes Park on property located within the jurisdictional limits of the Town. 
C.  Procedure for Location and Extent Review.   
1.  Public Uses. 
a.  A proposed development plan shall be submitted to the EVPC for approval, pursuant to the development plan approval process set forth in §3.8 of this Chapter, prior to the construction or authorization of any public use that is subject to location and extent review. 
b.  Failure of the EVPC to act within thirty (30) days after the date of official submission of the development plan shall be deemed an approval, unless a longer period is granted by the submitting board, body or official. 
c.  If the EVPC disapproves the development plan, it shall communicate its reasons to the Board of County Commissioners or Board of Trustees, depending on the location of the proposed project. The respective Board is authorized to overrule such disapproval by a majority vote of its entire membership. Upon overruling, the Board may proceed with construction or authorization of the project, as applicable. 
d.  If the project is not required to be authorized or financed by the Board of County Commissioners or Board of Trustees, or other County or Town official or board, the EVPC's disapproval may be overruled by the body or official having jurisdiction over the authorization and financing of the project. A vote to overrule by such body shall be by a majority vote of its entire membership. In the case of a utility owned by an entity other than a political subdivision, the EVPC's disapproval may be overruled by the Public Utilities Commission by not less than a majority of its entire membership. 
(Ord. 05-18 §1(Exh. A)) 
D.  Standards for Review. The EVPC and Boards shall review the extent and location of the proposed public use for its consistency with the goals, policies and objectives stated in the Comprehensive Plan and for its compliance with this Code. 
(Ord. 05-18 §1(Exh. A), 4/10/18)  
§ 3.14 - Separate Lot Determinations 
A.  Purpose and Applicability.   
1.  This Section shall be used to review all questions or disputes regarding separate lot determinations based on the definition set forth in §13.3.135.b. In determining whether or not the individual parcel was intended at the time of its creation to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit, the standards for review set forth in §3.14.C shall be considered, in addition to other relevant factors. 
B.  Procedures for Separate Lot Determinations. The procedure for an application for a separate lot determination shall be as follows: 
1.  Step 1: Pre-application Conference. A pre-application conference is voluntary for separate lot determinations. 
2.  Step 2: Staff Review and Action. Within thirty (30) days from the date a complete application is submitted, the Staff shall: (a) review the application according to the standards set forth in this Section; (b) consult with the Town or County Attorneys and other staff, as necessary; and (c) make a final determination as to whether the individual parcel in question is a lot. 
3.  Appeals. Appeals from the Staff's separate lot determination shall be made to the respective Boards. 
4.  Form of Determination. All final determinations by Staff or the Boards shall be provided to the Applicant in writing and shall be filed in the official record of separate lot determinations. 
C.  Standards for Review. In determining whether or not the individual parcel was intended at the time of its creation to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit, the following factors shall, where relevant, be considered, in addition to other relevant factors: 
1.  Shape, size and physical character of the parcel. For example, if the parcel in question will comply with the adequate public facilities requirements set forth in §7.12 of this Code and a principal structure can be built meeting all applicable setbacks, the individual parcel may have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit. Also, for example, if the shape, size or physical character of the parcel in question is not similar to lots in the same neighborhood, the individual parcel may not have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit. Also for example, if the shape of the parcel indicates that it was intended to be used for physical access or for the provision of utilities, the individual parcel may not have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit; 
2.  Historic use of the parcel in question. For example, if a principal structure was built over the boundary line in question, the individual parcel may not have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit; 
3.  Historic property ownership patterns. For example, if no portion of the parcel in question has been individually deeded into separate ownership from the remaining portion of the parcel at any time prior to May 5, 1972, the individual parcel may not have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit; 
4.  Private restrictions in effect at the time the parcel was created. For example, if private covenants in effect at the time of conveyance prohibited the creation of more than one (1) lot, the individual parcel may not have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit; 
5.  If no portion of the parcel in question was ever taxed separately by the Larimer County Tax Assessor, the individual parcel may not have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit; 
6.  If the parcel in question is divided by a municipal or county boundary line, the individual parcel may have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit; and 
7.  If the parcel in question was delineated on an unrecorded subdivision plat and created conformance with the applicable subdivision and zoning regulations, if any, in effect at the time of creation, the individual parcel may have been intended to be separately owned, developed and otherwise used as a separate developable unit. 
D.  Official Record of Separate Lot Determinations. An official record of separate lot determinations shall be kept on file in the office of the Town of Estes Park Community Development Director during normal business hours. The record shall be available for public inspection in the Estes Park Community Development Department during normal business hours.

4.  A project with multiple required public hearing dates (for example, a project with a Planning Commission Public Hearing followed by a Town Board Public Hearing) may retain the same posted notice(s) throughout the cycle of public hearings, provided the posted notice(s) remain in reasonable repair and continue to be legible per the requirements of Section C.1. 
5.  Proof that the property was posted in accord with this Section shall be provided to the department prior to the opening of any public hearing. A date-stamped photograph of the posted notice in context, showing a date in compliance, shall be deemed adequate proof for purposes of this Section. 
6.  Removal, damage or destruction of a properly posted notice by weather or other natural occurrence shall not be construed as failure to comply with the public-notice provisions of this Code. 
(Ord. 08-18 §1(Exh. A), 5/8/18)  
§ 3.16 - Conditional Use Permit 
(Ord. 21-10 §1) 
A.  Procedures for Approval on Conditional Use Permit. Applications for approval of a Conditional Use Permit shall follow the standard development approval process set forth in §3.2 of this Chapter, except for the following modifications. 
B.  Standards for Review. All applications for a conditional use permit shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable criteria and standards set forth in Chapter 5, "Use Regulations," of this Code and the following requirement: 
The application for the proposed conditional use permits mitigates, to the maximum extent feasible, potential adverse impacts on nearby land uses, public facilities and services and the environment. 
C.  Lapse.   
1.  Failure of an Applicant to apply for a building permit and commence construction or operation with regard to the conditional use permit approval within one (1) year of receiving approval of the conditional use permit, or as otherwise explicitly set forth in the original approval, shall automatically terminate the conditional use permit. 
2.  If a legally established conditional use permit is abandoned or discontinued for a period of one (1) consecutive year or more, then the decision originally approving such conditional use permit shall automatically terminate. 
3.  Prior to expiration of a conditional use permit, the property owner may file for a one year extension. Such extension may be granted by the Community Development Director upon determination that there have been no changes to the Estes Valley Development Code that would affect the approved conditional use permit or conditions of approval.

C.  Uses Not Listed as Permitted. Uses not specifically listed as permitted by right or by special review in a specific zoning district, as depicted in Use Tables 4-1 and 4-4, are prohibited unless such use is subsequently permitted pursuant to the use classification procedure set forth in §3.12 of this Code, or the rezoning/amendment procedure set forth in §3.3 of this Code.  
§ 4.3 - Residential Zoning Districts 
A.  List of Districts/Specific Purposes.   
1.  RE-1 Rural Estate Zoning District. This district is established to protect and preserve some of the most rural areas of the Estes Valley in which significant view sheds, woodlands, rock outcroppings, ridgelines, other sensitive environmental areas and low-density residential development comprise the predominant land use pattern. This zone implements the "Rural Estate (RE-1)" future land use designation contained in the Comprehensive Plan. The district regulations allow for the development of low-density single-family residential uses, generally at densities no greater than one (1) dwelling unit per ten (10) acres. 
2.  RE Rural Estate Zoning District. This district is established to permit relatively low-density single-family residential development in areas of the Estes Valley where this is the established and predominant land use pattern. This zone implements the "Rural Estate (RE)" future land use designation contained in the Comprehensive Plan. New residential development is encouraged to incorporate rural residential conservation designs, such as clustering and other open space preservation techniques, in order to preserve the existing rural character and limit development in sensitive environmental areas such as steep sloped areas. The regulations contained in this district will permit continued, low-density residential development, generally at densities no greater than one (1) dwelling unit per two and one-half (2.5) acres. 
3.  E-1 Estate Zoning District. This district is established to preserve the predominantly lower density residential uses that have been established in the Estes Valley. This zone implements the "Estate (E-1)" future land use designation contained in the Comprehensive Plan. The district regulations permit single-family residential uses at densities of one (1) dwelling unit per acre. 
4.  E Estate Zoning District. This district is established to encourage moderate density single-family residential uses in areas of the Estes Valley convenient to services and the key highway corridors. This zone implements the "Estate (E)" future land use designation contained in the Comprehensive Plan. District regulations are intended to continue the predominant single-family detached use, while providing for additional parks, open space and trail/bikeway linkages to Downtown Estes Park and existing systems whenever possible. District regulations permit single-family residential uses at densities of two (2) dwelling units per acre, with a minimum lot area of one-half (½) acre. 
5.  R Single-Family Residential Zoning District. This district is established to preserve and encourage relatively high-density single-family residential uses primarily within the Town of Estes Park. This zone implements the "Residential (R)" future land use designation contained in the Comprehensive Plan. District regulations are intended to continue the predominant single-family detached use, while providing for additional open space and trail/bikeway linkages to Downtown Estes Park and existing systems whenever possible. District regulations permit single-family residential uses at densities of four (4) dwelling units per acre, with a minimum lot area of one-quarter (¼) acre. 
6.  R-1 Single-Family Residential Zoning District. This district is established to provide opportunities for attainable single-family residential development within the Town of Estes Park and in close proximity to services. Accordingly, district regulations will allow densities of up to eight (8) dwelling units per acre, with a minimum lot area of five thousand (5,000) square feet, subject to the attainable housing limitations in §11.4.C of this Code. 
7.  R-2 Two-Family Residential. This district is established to encourage development of relatively denser residential housing, including two-family dwellings (duplexes) as well as single-family detached housing, primarily within the town limits of Estes Park. This zone implements the "Two-Family (R-2)" future land use designation contained in the Comprehensive Plan. District regulations will allow a minimum lot area of eighteen thousand (18,000) square feet for single-family uses and twenty-seven thousand (27,000) square feet for two-family dwellings (duplexes). 
8.  RM Multi-Family Residential. This district is established to provide opportunities for multi-family residential development. This zone implements the "Multi-Family (MF)" future land use designation contained in the Comprehensive Plan.

C.  Density/Dimensional Standards.   
1.  Density Calculation. (See also Chapter 1, §1.9.C.) 
a.  Net land area . Net land area shall be determined by subtracting from the gross land area the following: 
(1)  Eighty percent (80%) of lands located in the 100-year floodplain; 
(2)  Eighty percent (80%) of lands located above the elevation serviceable by the Town of Estes Park water system; 
(3)  All lands within private streets or dedicated public rights-of-way; and 
(4)  All lands subject to a ground lease that, because of the lease terms, would not be available for development of the proposed land use(s) on the subject property. 
b.  Net density . Net density shall be calculated by dividing the net land area by the minimum lot area or land area required for each unit. 
c.  When applying a density standard to a parcel's net land area, all resulting fractions shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number. 
d.  The number of dwelling or accommodations units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards shall be met. The maximum density established for a zoning district (See Table 4-2 below) is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a valid justification for varying other dimensional or development standards. 
2.  Table of Density and Dimensional Standards by Zoning District. Table 4-2 below lists the density and dimensional standards that apply within the residential zoning districts. These are "base" standards and are not guarantees that stated minimums or maximums can be achieved on every site. Other regulations of this Code or site-specific conditions may further limit development on a specific site. 
3.  Maximum Number of Principal Structures Permitted Per Lot or Development Parcel. Except in the RM zoning district, only one (1) principal structure shall be permitted per lot or development parcel.

§ 4.4 - Nonresidential Zoning Districts 
A.  List of Districts/Specific Purposes.   
1.  Accommodations Zoning Districts.   
a.  A Accommodations/Highway Corridor Zoning District . This district implements the "A-Accommodations" land use category set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. It applies primarily in highway-oriented commercial areas of the Estes Valley, and allows a wide variety of accommodation uses, including relatively higher-intensity accommodations such as multi-story hotels and motels. A variety of related tourist-serving retail and commercial uses, such as restaurants, bars and gift shops, will be permitted, but only as accessory uses to a principal accommodations use and only if such supporting uses are located inside the same structure as the principal use. Stand-alone commercial or retail uses will not be permitted in this accommodations district; instead, such uses may be developed in the other commercial zones. 
b.  A-1 Accommodations/Low-Intensity Zoning District . This district implements the "A-1-Accommodations" land use category set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. This district provides for low-intensity and small-scale residential uses, low-intensity accommodations and very limited accessory uses located along highway and roadway corridors characterized by low-intensity residential and lodging uses, including resort lodges, cabins and condominium developments. Aside from these limited residential and accommodation uses, no new commercial development shall be permitted in this district. New uses, including new accommodations, shall be developed consistent in intensity, bulk and design with the low-scale, residential character of this district. 
2.  Commercial Zoning Districts.   
a.  CD Downtown Commercial . This zone district is established to provide a wide variety and relatively high intensity of retail and commercial services within Downtown Estes Park to serve both residents and visitors. The CD District implements the "CBD-Commercial Downtown" land use category set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. This district is intended to encourage a predominance of compact and pedestrian-scale retail, service and office uses in the Downtown core. Residential uses, especially employee housing or when mixed with commercial or retail uses, are also encouraged within the district to provide alternative housing choices for the Valley's workforce. 
It is the intent that the Downtown maintain its function as the Valley's focal point of tourist shopping and entertainment activity. This area is also a key economic engine for the Town of Estes Park and the Valley; therefore, future sales-tax generating uses are strongly encouraged. ;b03; It is also the intent of this district that new development develop in ways integrating and even enhancing the qualities of the streams, rivers, topography and other natural assets of the area. 
b.  CO Outlying Commercial Zoning District . This zoning district is established to encourage the development of a wide variety of commercial and retail uses along the major corridor entryways into the Valley and the Town of Estes Park. This zoning district is established to implement the "Commercial" and "Commercial-Recreation" future land use categories recommended in the Comprehensive Plan. This district should accommodate the majority of the larger, freestanding commercial and retail buildings to meet future demand in the community. 
c.  O Office Zoning District . This zoning district is established to implement the "Office" future land use category recommended in the Comprehensive Plan. The intensity of future office development will be controlled through district standards. 
(Ord. 27-17 §1(Exh.)) 
d.  CH Heavy Commercial Zoning District . This zoning district is intended to provide for heavy commercial uses, including vehicle repair services, construction trades and bulk goods retailing. It shall be limited to areas within the Estes Valley that already contain some of these types of heavy commercial uses, and shall not include areas fronting the Valley's highways or arterial streets. Permitted uses shall include utility facilities and installations, repair services, bulk storage and limited manufacturing. Most of these uses shall be permitted by right, but subject to specific size limitations. Larger facilities shall be subject to special review. 
3.  Industrial Zoning Districts.   
a.  I-1 Restricted Industrial Zoning District . This zoning district implements the "Restricted Industrial" land use category recommended in the Comprehensive Plan. Permitted uses shall include a relatively wide variety of industrial uses, as reflected in the existing mix of industrial land uses, including several concrete/asphalt plants, propane distributors, construction trade yards and gravel mining and crushing facilities. However, to discourage future conflicts, residential uses shall not be permitted in this zoning district. An important element of development in this industrial zone district shall be compliance with performance standards to protect adjacent uses from adverse impacts of industrial development.

C.  Density and Dimensional Standards.   
1.  Table of Density and Dimensional Standards by Zoning District. Table 4-5 below lists the density and dimensional standards that apply within the nonresidential zoning districts. These are "base" standards, not guarantees that stated minimums or maximums can be achieved on every site. Other regulations of this Code or site-specific conditions may further limit development on a site. 
2.  Minimum Land Area Requirements for Accommodation and Residential Uses in the Nonresidential Zoning Districts. Table 4-5 below includes a standard for "minimum land area per accommodations (guest) or residential unit," which applies only in the A, A-1 and CD zoning districts. The "minimum land area" necessary to meet this standard shall be measured using the net land area definition set forth in §4.3.C, "Density/Dimensional Standards." When applying the minimum land area standard to a parcel's net land area, all resulting fractions shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number. 
3.  Maximum Units/Density Not Guaranteed. The number of dwelling or guest units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards shall be met. The maximum residential or accommodations density established for a zoning district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a valid justification for varying other dimensional or development standards.

B.  Vacation Home.   
1.  All vacation homes shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Annual Operating Registration. 
(1)  All vacation homes shall obtain an operating registration on an annual basis, according to an application period as specified in this Code. An operating registration shall be effective on and following the date of issuance for all of the remaining calendar year in which it is issued, unless suspended or revoked for cause, provided that registered vacation homes may continue operation during January 1 and March 31 of any calendar year following a year in which the vacation home was duly registered. 
(2)  If the property is located within Town limits, the business license shall be considered the operating registration. If the property is within the unincorporated Estes Valley, an operating registration shall be obtained from the Town of Estes Park Town Clerk's Office. 
(3)  Beginning January 1, 2017, the annual period for filing operating registration applications shall begin January 1 of each year and end on March 31 of each year, in accordance with subsection (1). Issuance of an operating registration between April 1 and December 31 in any given calendar year shall take place on a schedule determined by the Town Clerk's office and such schedule shall be at the sole discretion of the Town. 
(4)  Pro-ration and partial reduction in any required registration fees for an operating registration issued after January 1 in any given year shall not be authorized. 
(5)  No more than one (1) operating registration shall be issued and effective in any given calendar year for each vacation home. An active registration for a specific vacation home shall be transferable to a different owner in accordance with procedures in this Code and as established by the Town Clerk's Office. 
(6)  Effective December 16, 2016, vacation home operating registrations in residential zoning districts (designated herein as zoning districts E, E-1, R, R-1, R-2, RE, RE-1, and RM) shall be held at a maximum total ("cap") of 588 registrations in effect at any given time. This cap shall be reviewed annually by the Planning Commission and governing Boards, in or near the month of April beginning in or near April 2017. Applications received at any time such that their approval would cause the cap to be exceeded shall be held and kept on file in the order they are received and deemed complete by the Town Clerk's Office. Registrations held on such list shall be issued during the calendar year as operating registrations may become available. 
(7)  Vacation homes in non-residential zoning districts (designated as all zoning districts except those enumerated in the preceding subsection) shall not be included in or subject to this cap. 
(8)  Beginning December 16, 2016, every vacation home for which an operating application is made shall require that the vacation home undergo and pass an initial inspection in accordance with this Code prior to issuance of the operating registration. 
(9)  [Reserved] 
(10)  Issuance of an operating registration for a vacation home shall not constitute a zoning entitlement for a property's use as a vacation home, nor shall absence of an operating registration for a vacation home constitute removal or abrogation of a property's zoning permissibility for use as a vacation home. However, both appropriate zoning permission and compliance and a valid current operating registration shall be necessary elements in order for operation as a vacation home to occur. 
(11)  Operating registrations that are deemed active as of December 31 in any given year shall have priority for renewal in the following calendar year over any new operating registration applications, provided a re-application for said active registration is received and deemed complete, all required inspections passed, and fees paid by March 31 of the renewal calendar year.

The person set forth on the application shall be the representative of the owner for immediate violation resolution purposes with regard to the operation of the vacation home. The local representative may be the same person as the property owner. An annual operating registration shall not be valid unless the property owner, and the designated local representative (if different), sign the operating registration application acknowledging all vacation home regulations. If the local representative changes during the calendar year, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to notify the Town Clerk within fifteen (15) days of change, and to ensure the new local representative is knowledgeable of all vacation home regulations. If the property owner changes during the calendar year, it shall be the responsibility of the new property owner of record to transfer the operating registration into his/her name and to ensure all other regulations in this Section are in compliance. 
(13)  State Sales Tax License. A condition of issuance of the annual operating registration shall be proof of a current sales tax license, provided by the applicant. 
(14)  Violations. The relevant Decision-Making Entity may deny or withhold the renewal of an annual operating registration until a violation related to such property, use or development is corrected, in accordance with §12.4.A.1. The relevant Decision-Making Entity may revoke or suspend the annual operating registration at any time in accordance with §12.4.A.2. Operating the vacation home during any such period of suspension or revocation shall be a violation of this Code. Appeals to this section shall be made in accordance with the appeals process in the Estes Valley Development Code. 
(15)  Nothing described herein shall limit the Town or County, within their respective jurisdictions, from exercising other remedies and enforcement powers pursuant to Chapter 12 of this Code or other penalties and enforcement powers as may be available at law. 
b.  Estes Park Municipal Code. Properties located within the Town of Estes Park shall comply with all the conditions and requirements set forth in the Town of Estes Park Municipal Code, Chapter 5.20 (Business Licenses). In case of conflict between Chapter 5.20 and provisions of §5.1.B of this Code, the provisions of §5.1.B of this Code shall control.

CHAPTER 6. NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS 
 
§ 6.1 - APPLICABILITY 
A.  General. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to uses, structures (except signs) and lots that were legally existing as of the effective date of this Code, February 1, 2000, but that become nonconforming as the result of the application of this Code to them or from reclassification of the property under any subsequent amendments to this Code. 
B.  Signs. For provisions applicable to nonconforming signs, see Chapter 8.  
§ 6.2 - PURPOSE 
It is the general policy under this Code to allow nonconforming uses, structures or lots to continue to exist and to be put to productive use. The limitations of this Chapter are intended to recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use their property but to reasonably control expansions, reestablishment of discontinued uses and the reestablishment of nonconforming buildings and structures that have been substantially destroyed.  
§ 6.3 - CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING USES OR STRUCTURES 
A.  Authority to Continue. Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter.

1.  Alteration/Extension of Nonconforming Uses Prohibited. Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, except as allowed in §6.4 below, a nonconforming use shall not be altered or extended. The extension of a nonconforming use to a portion of a structure which was built for the nonconforming use at the time of adoption of this Code is not an extension of a nonconforming use. 
(Ord. 21-11 §1) 
2.  Alteration/Extension of Nonconforming Structures Limited. Except as allowed in §3.6.C of this Code, a structure conforming as to use, but nonconforming as to height, setback or coverage, may be altered or extended, provided that the alteration or extension does not result in a new violation of this Code or increase the degree or extent of the existing nonconformity. (See §3.6, Variances; a variance may be sought to permit alterations or extensions to a nonconforming structure not otherwise allowed by this Chapter.) (Ord. 21-11 §1) 
D.  Nonconforming as to Parking. 
1.  Nonconformity as to off-street parking or loading shall not subject the use to the conditions of this Chapter. 
2.  A use that is nonconforming as to off-street parking or loading shall not be changed to another use requiring more off-street parking or loading unless the additional required parking or loading is provided. 
3.  The Board of Adjustment may permit a nonconforming use to provide required off-street parking or loading on a lot other than the lot on which the use is located. 
(Ord. 21-11 §1, 12/20/11)  
§ 6.4 - CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USE 
A.  If a nonconforming use is changed, it shall be changed to a use conforming to the regulations of the zoning district and, after the change, it shall not be changed back again to a nonconforming use. 
(Ord. 21-11 §1) 
B.  A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use in phases over time, provided that such phasing is in accordance with a development plan approved pursuant to the procedures set forth in §3.8 of this Code. 
(Ord. 21-11 §1) 
C.  A nonconforming accessory dwelling unit may be altered, provided that the alteration does not enlarge or move the accessory dwelling unit. See §13.3.13, Alter or Alteration. 
(Ord. 21-11 §1) 
(Ord. 21-11 §1, 12/20/11)  
§ 6.5 - DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USE 
If a nonconforming use is abandoned or discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, further use of the property or structure shall be for a conforming use and its nonconforming status shall terminate.  
§ 6.6 - DAMAGE TO OR DESTRUCTION OF A NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE OR STRUCTURE CONTAINING A NONCONFORMING USE 
If a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, wind, explosion or act of God, the nonconforming structure or use may continue, but restoration shall be started within one (1) year of such calamity and shall be completed within three (3) years of initiating restoration.  
§ 6.7 - ZONING DISTRICT CHANGES 
Whenever the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed so as to transfer an area from one (1) district to another district of a different classification, this Chapter shall apply to any nonconforming uses existing therein.  
§ 6.8 - USES ALLOWED ON NONCONFORMING LOTS 
A.  Nonconforming Lots in Residential Zoning Districts. In all residential zoning districts, a lot that is nonconforming as to area or dimension as of the effective date of this Code may be occupied by a single-family detached residential use, subject to all other applicable zoning district and development standards unless a variance is granted by the Board of Adjustment. 
B.  Nonconforming Lots in Nonresidential Zoning Districts. In all nonresidential zoning districts, a lot that is nonconforming as to area or dimension as of the effective date of this Code may be occupied by any use permitted by right in the zoning district, provided that a by-right accommodations use shall not be developed on a lot with an area less than: 
1.  Forty thousand (40,000) square feet in the A zoning district, or 
2.  Fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet in the A-1 zoning district. 
Such uses shall be subject to all other applicable zoning district and development standards unless a variance is granted by the Board of Adjustment.

3.  Definition. For purposes of this Section, "average slope" shall be measured as set forth in Chapter 13 of this Code. See Figure 7-1. 
 
Figure 7-1
B.  Development Restrictions on Steep Slopes.   
1.  Applicability. These development restrictions shall apply to all new development in the Estes Valley, except for development on lots that were approved for single-family residential use prior to the effective date of this Code. 
(Ord. 18-02 #1) 
2.  New Structures-Existing Slopes in Excess of Thirty Percent.   
a.  New development proposed to be built on any portion of a site containing a slope of thirty percent (30%) or greater shall be subject to Staff review and approval of a development plan pursuant to §3.8 of this Code. This provision applies to development that would otherwise be exempt from the development plan review process (e.g., single-family developments containing less than three [3] units). 
b.  Staff shall review all such development plans and evaluate them according to the following standards: 
(1)  Site disturbance shall be minimized to the maximum extent practicable (see §7.2.D, "Limitations on Site Disturbance" below); 
(2)  Cuts for utilities and access driveways shall be shared to the maximum extent feasible; 
(3)  To the maximum extent feasible, new construction shall not take place on any portion of a parcel that shows evidence of slope instability, landslides, avalanche, flooding or other natural or manmade hazards (see §7.7, "Geologic and Wildfire Hazard Areas" below); 
(4)  The Applicant shall demonstrate that the slope's ground surface and subsurface are not unstable, that the proposed development will not cause instability or increase the potential for slope failure, and that the development of the slope will not increase the degree of hazard both on-site and on adjacent properties. 
c.  For purposes of this subsection, steepness of slope shall be measured from the points with highest and lowest elevation within five (5) feet of any portion of the proposed structure. 
3.  Structure Clearance from Steep Slopes. Structure clearance from ascending or descending slopes greater than thirty percent (30%) shall comply with the requirements set forth in the applicable Building Code provisions.

C.  Ridgeline Protection Standards.   
1.  Applicability. This Section shall apply to all new development in the Estes Valley on land identified on the Estes Valley Ridgeline Protection Map as designated ridgeline protection areas. If the site contains an identified ridgeline, the Applicant may, by site specific analysis, demonstrate that the location of the proposed development is not on an identified ridgeline. Staff may then waive these standards. 
2.  Building/Roof Design for Ridgeline Protection. Development subject to this subsection shall be designed and sited to minimize the visible intrusion of buildings and structures above the designated ridgelines or above existing ridge-top trees or vegetation, and thus preserve identified scenic views across or through the site. Techniques to meet this standard shall include, but are not limited to, careful consideration of architectural design, building massing, siting, building colors and roofing materials, and the use of native landscaping or other permitted screening materials. For example, compliance with this standard may require siting a building below a ridgeline so there is a solid, mountain backdrop behind the building. See Figure 7-2. 
 
Figure 7-2
3.  Development Plan. All development subject to these ridgeline protection standards shall submit a development plan, including a visual analysis of the proposed development, for staff review and approval pursuant to §3.8 of this Code. This provision applies to development that would otherwise be exempt from the development plan review process (e.g., single-family developments containing less than three [3] units). The required visual analysis shall include a photographic simulation of the development, from viewpoints as determined by Staff. 
D.  Staff Waiver of Ridgeline Protection Standards.   
1.  Staff may grant such waivers or modifications to the ridgeline protection standards only if it finds, based on substantial evidence presented by the Applicant, that the following conditions are satisfied: 
a.  Application of the ridgeline standards renders the site undevelopable; or 
b.  Application of the ridgeline standards will result in a substantial economic hardship (as defined in Chapter 13), and the economic hardship is not created by the Applicant or otherwise self-imposed; and 
c.  The development conforms with all other development, site design and environmental standards set forth in this Chapter and in all other applicable ordinances and codes. 
2.  In granting a waiver from or modification of the ridgeline protection standards set forth in this Section, Staff may impose conditions if the effect of the conditions is to reduce the adverse impacts of the development, including but not limited to a reduction in maximum building height below what would otherwise be permitted in the applicable zoning district.

§ 7.2 - GRADING AND SITE DISTURBANCE STANDARDS 
A.  Applicability. These grading and site disturbance standards shall apply to all new development in the Estes Valley, except for single-family residential development on a lot created and approved for such use prior to the effective date of this Code. 
(Ord. 18-02 #1; Ord. 8-05 #1) 
B.  Grading Standards.   
1.  Grading Prohibited Without Prior Approvals/Permits. No grading, excavation or tree/vegetation removal shall be permitted, whether to provide for a building site, for on-site utilities or services or for any roads or driveways, prior to final approval of a grading and excavation report/plan submitted in support of the project development plan or the issuance of a building permit. 
2.  Limits on Changing Natural Grade. The original, natural grade of a lot shall not be raised or lowered more than ten (10) feet at any point for construction of any structure or improvement, except: 
a.  For foundation walls incorporated into the principal structure to allow for walk-out basements; or 
b.  The site's original grade may be raised or lowered a maximum of twelve (12) feet if a retaining wall or terracing is used to reduce the steepness of manmade slopes, provided that the retaining wall or terracing comply with the requirements set forth in this Section. See Figure 7-3. 
 
Figure 7-3
3.  Cutting to Create Benches. Cutting and grading to create benches or pads for additional or larger building sites or lawns shall be avoided to the maximum extent feasible. See Figure 7-4. 
 
Figure 7-4
4.  Grading for Accessory Building Pads Discouraged. Separate pads for accessory buildings and structures other than garages, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, outbuildings and similar facilities, shall be discouraged except where the average natural slope is twenty percent (20%) or less, as measured from the points with highest and lowest elevation within five (5) feet of any portion of the proposed accessory structure or building. 
5.  Limits on Graded or Filled Manmade Slopes.   
a.  Slopes of twenty-five percent (25%) or less are strongly encouraged wherever feasible or practicable. 
b.  Except as provided below, graded or filled manmade slopes shall not exceed a slope of fifty percent (50%) (a 2:1 slope) unless a soils engineering or a geotechnical report is furnished stating that the site has been investigated and that, in the opinion of the qualified professional, a cut at a steeper slope will be stable and not create a hazard to public or private property. 
c.  If a steeper slope will result in less overall site disturbance, then graded or filled manmade slopes associated with road construction may exceed a slope of seventy-five percent (75%) (1.5:1 slope). 
6.  Retaining Walls. Limited use of retaining walls is encouraged to reduce the steepness of manmade slopes and to provide planting pockets on steep slopes conducive to revegetation, subject to the following standards. See Figure 7-5: 
a.  Retaining walls shall be used to provide breaks in manmade slopes exceeding thirty percent (30%) and to provide planting pockets. 
b.  Retaining walls may be permitted to support steep slopes but shall not exceed six (6) feet in height from the finished grade, except for: 
(1)  A structure's foundation wall, or 
(2)  As necessary to construct a driveway from the street to a garage or parking area, or 
(3)  As otherwise expressly allowed by this Section or Chapter. 
c.  Retaining walls greater than four (4) feet in height shall be supported by appropriate engineering and reviewed and approved by Staff before construction. 
d.  The width of the terrace between any two (2) four-foot vertical retaining walls shall be at least three (3) feet. Retaining walls higher than four (4) feet shall be separated from any other retaining wall by a minimum of five (5) horizontal feet. Terraces created between retaining walls shall be permanently landscaped or revegetated. See §7.5, "Landscaping" below. 
e.  Retaining walls visible from an arterial street or highway, or from public open areas or parks, shall be screened by vegetation or faced with wood, stone or other earth-colored materials that blend with the surrounding natural landscape. 
f.  All retaining walls shall comply with applicable Building Code provisions, except that when any provision of this Section conflicts with any provision set forth in the Building Code, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
 
Figure 7-5
7.  Filling or Dredging of Waterways Prohibited. Filling, draining or dredging of water courses, wetlands, gullies, stream beds or stormwater runoff channels is prohibited, except as authorized with a floodplain development permit or with an approved development plan. 
8.  Detention/Stormwater Facilities. Where detention basins and other storm and erosion control facilities may be required, any adverse visual and aesthetic impacts on the natural landscape and topography shall be minimized to the maximum extent feasible. See Figure 7-6. 
 
Figure 7-6
C.  Restoration of Disturbed Areas.   
1.  Follow Natural Contours. All disturbed areas shall be restored as natural-appearing land forms, with curves that blend in with adjacent undisturbed slopes. Abrupt angular transitions and linear slopes shall be avoided. 
2.  Revegetation Required. Areas disturbed by grading shall be contoured so they can be revegetated and shall be revegetated within one (1) growing season after construction, using native species similar to those growing on the site when such revegetation does not contribute to hazards. Revegetation shall be sufficient to provide erosion control and to prevent the invasion of weeds. (See also §7.3 and §7.5 regarding tree/vegetation preservation and landscaping requirements.) Plans for revegetation of cut-and-fill and graded slopes shall be included as part of the landscaping plan submitted as part of the project development plan approval process. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
3.  Man-Made Slopes Greater than Twenty-five Percent. On man-made slopes of twenty-five percent (25%) or greater, plant materials with deep rooting characteristics shall be selected that will minimize erosion and reduce surface runoff. 
4.  Man-Made Slopes Greater than Fifty Percent. On man-made slopes greater than fifty percent (50%), the Staff shall require additional stabilization measures such as erosion netting or hydro-mulching to ensure adequate stabilization and revegetation. 
5.  Topsoil Stockpiled. To the maximum extent feasible, topsoil that is removed during construction shall be stockpiled and conserved for later use on areas requiring revegetation or landscaping, such as cut-and-fill slopes. 
6.  Cut Rock Treatment. Disturbed areas resulting in rock cuts shall be treated with a rock-staining agent to the extent necessary to match the predominant colors of the surrounding soils or rocks. 
D.  Limitations on Site Disturbance.   
1.  Establishment of Limits of Disturbance. The Applicant shall propose, and the Decision-Making Body shall establish on each preliminary and final subdivision plat and on each project development plan, a "limits of disturbance" ("LOD") line(s) according to the criteria set forth below. The LOD shall indicate the specific area(s) of a lot, lots or site within which the developed project (including buildings, accessory structures and driveways) may be constructed and within which the development activity shall be contained. See the definition at §13.3, paragraph 134, and Figure 7-7. 
2.  Criteria for Establishing LOD. In establishing the LOD, which may be multiple and noncontiguous on a site, the following criteria shall be taken into account: 
a.  Avoidance of visual impacts, including but not limited to ridgeline protection areas, steep slopes and scenic views. 
b.  Avoidance of steep slopes in excess of thirty percent (30%) and other erosion prevention and control measures, including but not limited to protection of natural drainage channels and compliance with an approved stormwater drainage management plan. 
c.  Preservation of forests, significant native trees, rock outcroppings or formations, and other significant native site vegetation. 
d.  Wildfire prevention and safety, including but not limited to location of trees and vegetation near structures.

§ 7.5 - LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERS 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The intent of this Section is to establish standards to protect and enhance the Estes Valley's appearance by the installation of appropriate landscaping and buffering materials; to encourage the preservation of native plant communities and ecosystems; to maintain and increase the value of land by providing for restoration of disturbed areas and by incorporating adequate landscaping into development; to restrict the spread of invasive plant species that disrupt and destroy native ecosystems; to encourage skilled installation and continued maintenance of all plant materials; and to establish procedures and standards for the administration and enforcement of this Section. 
B.  Applicability. These landscape and buffer standards shall apply to residential subdivisions created after the adoption of this Code, and to all development where development plan review is required by §3.8 of this Code. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
C.  Approval of Landscaping and Buffering Plan.   
1.  No development plan required under this Code shall receive final approval unless a landscaping and buffering plan meeting the requirements of this Section has been submitted and approved. Landscaping plans may include provision for phasing. Refer to Appendix B for landscaping plan submittal requirements. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
2.  Alternatives to the specifications concerning minimum plant sizes and quantities set forth in this Section may be authorized by the Decision-Making Body, provided that the Applicant submits a detailed landscaping plan and that the Decision-Making Body determines that the proposed landscaping satisfies the purpose and intent of this Section. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
3.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the following criteria are fully satisfied with regard to the approved landscaping and buffering plan: 
a.  Such plan has been fully implemented on the site and inspected by Staff. 
b.  Such plan, which cannot or will not be implemented immediately because of seasonal conditions or phasing, has, however, been guaranteed by an improvement agreement (or included in an approved development agreement) in a form agreeable to the Town or County and secured by a letter of credit, cash escrow or other instrument acceptable to the Town or County, in an amount equal to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the cost of materials and labor for all elements of the landscape plan. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
c.  A landscaping as-built plan, including sizes and quantities, details regarding revegetation, and irrigation, shall be submitted to Staff prior to inspection. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
D.  General Landscaping Design Standards. The following minimum standards shall apply to all landscaped areas developed under the requirements of this Section. See Subsections E through I below for additional specific landscaping requirements for multi-family, accommodation and nonresidential developments. 
1.  Aesthetic Enhancement Requirements. Landscaping shall be utilized in the design to enhance the aesthetic quality of the property by adding color, texture and visual interest while obscuring views of parking and unsightly areas and uses. In locations where new development alters visually attractive and distinctive natural landscapes, the selection and arrangement of new plantings shall be designed to complement and enhance the natural landscape character of the site. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
2.  Plant Materials.   
a.  (1)  Use of Native or Adaptive Plant Materials. Refer to the "ComDev Recommended Plant List" for lists of plant materials considered native or appropriate. The "ComDev Recommended Plant List" is an administrative advisory document, and shall not be construed as limiting landscape species choices to those listed, nor construed as excluding other landscape species choices; provided, however, that in identified important wildlife habitat areas in accordance with this Code, the provisions of Section 7.5.G.1.b shall apply. The "ComDev Recommended Plant List" is available by request from the Community Development Department, and is also available on the Town's website. In order to further water conservation and to assure adequate growth and survival of new plantings, all landscape plans shall be comprised entirely of native or adapted plants that reflect the surrounding plant materials and environment. All proposed plant materials shall be chosen from these lists unless Staff approves an equivalent alternative. 
(2)  Fire Resistant and FireWise Guidelines. In addition to the "ComDev Recommended Plant List", the following two (2) documents (or their successors and updates) are also recommended: "Fire Resistant Landscaping" (Fact Sheet No. 6.303, CSU Extension); and "FireWise Plant Materials (Fact Sheet No. 6.305, CSU Extension). These documents (or their successors and updates) shall be available through the Community Development Department, and shall be distributed by staff upon request. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1; Ord. 21-17 , § 1(Exh.)) 
b.  Existing Plant Materials . Healthy, existing trees, grasses and shrubs shall be incorporated into the landscape to the maximum extent feasible. These existing plants shall be shown on the landscape plan and labeled as "existing." Similarly, existing and retained trees shall be listed on the plan's plant list with their current size shown. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
(1)  Landscaping Credit . Existing trees and shrubs shall be credited against landscaping requirements, provided that they meet applicable standards such as size and location requirements. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
(2)  Preservation of Existing Trees . If located within twenty-five (25) feet of a property line at the street, no existing tree of four (4) inches DBH or greater, or dense stand of trees or shrubs of four (4) or more feet in both depth and height shall be removed, unless dictated by plant health, access, safety or identification of the premises, all as determined by Staff. See §7.3, "Tree and Vegetation Preservation," above, for additional requirements regarding preservation of existing and significant trees and plant material. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
(3)  Root zones . Design of the landscape shall take retained, existing trees into consideration with an adequate area provided around each tree that is free of impervious material to allow for infiltration of water and air. This pervious area shall be equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the drip line of the tree. The root zones of existing trees and shrubs to be preserved shall be protected from unnecessary disturbance due to cut or fill grade changes. The location of underground utility lines shall be carefully planned to avoid unnecessary disturbance of root zones that would threaten the survival of existing trees and shrubs to be preserved. (See also Appendix D for protection of trees/vegetation during construction activities.) (Ord. 8-05 #1) 
c.  Species Mix . Species variation is required for all landscape plans because species uniformity can result in disease susceptibility and eventual demise of a large portion of a landscape at one (1) time. Landscape plans shall exhibit species variation, which shall increase based on the number of trees proposed in the landscaping plan. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
d.  Plant Sizes . At the time of installation, plants shall be no smaller than the following: 
(1)  Deciduous trees: 
(a)  Fifty percent (50%) of amount on site: four-inch caliper. 
(b)  Fifty percent (50%) of amount on site: two-inch caliper. 
(2)  Evergreen trees: 
(a)  Fifty percent (50%) of amount on site: eight (8) feet tall. 
(b)  Fifty percent (50%) of amount on site: six (6) feet tall. 
(3)  All shrubs: five-gallon. 
(4)  It may be necessary for plant size to exceed these minimums in order to meet special buffering or screening needs. Individual species' growth rates and patterns shall be considered when choosing the installation size of plants. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
e.  Plant Quality . All plant material shall meet the American Association of Nurserymen specifications for Number 1 grade, and shall comply with the quality standards of the Colorado Nursery Act, Title 35, Article 26, C.R.S., as amended. 
f.  Plant Quantity . See Subsections E through I below for the quantity of landscaping required for each specific use category subject to this Section's requirements. 
3.  Location and Arrangement of Required Landscaping.   
a.  The selection and arrangement of new plantings shall be planned to create visual appeal, to provide effective screening, to define site circulation and to enhance the use of the site. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
b.  All required landscaping elements shall be located on the property they serve. Landscaping located on adjacent properties or street rights-of-way shall not count toward the landscaping requirements of this Section. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1) 
c.  All required landscaping shall be located outside of any adjacent right-of-way unless a waiver is received from Estes Park or Larimer County Public Works. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1)

§ 7.9 - EXTERIOR LIGHTING 
A.  Purpose. The intent of this Section is to focus on the actual physical effects of lighting, as well as the effect that lighting may have on the surrounding neighborhood. Exterior lighting shall be evaluated in the development review process to ensure that the functional and security needs of the project are met in a way that does not adversely affect the adjacent properties or neighborhood. The degree to which exterior night lighting affects a property owner or neighborhood will be examined considering the light source, level of illumination, hours of illumination and need for illumination in relation to the effects of the lighting on adjacent property owners and the neighborhood. 
B.  Applicability. All new development shall comply with the standards set forth in this Section. Vacation homes as designated and regulated in §5.1.B of this Code shall comply with the standards set forth in this Section, whether new or existing. 
(Ord. 29-16, § 1; Ord. 09-17, § 1) 
C.  General Review Standard. If installed, all exterior lighting shall meet the functional security needs of the proposed land use without adversely affecting adjacent properties or the community. 
D.  Design Standards. Exterior lighting is not required except for purposes of public safety. However, if installed, all exterior lighting shall meet the following design standards: 
1.  Light sources shall be concealed or shielded with luminaires with cut-offs with an angle not exceeding ninety (90) degrees to minimize the potential for glare and unnecessary diffusion on adjacent property. In no case shall exterior lighting add more than one (1) foot-candle to illumination levels at any point off site. See Figure 7-11. 
 
Figure 7-11 (Ord. 8-05 #1)
2.  All outdoor light not necessary for security purposes shall be reduced, activated by motion sensors devices or turned off during nonoperating hours. 
3.  Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues or any other objects mounted on a pole, pedestal or platform shall use a narrow cone beam or light that will not extend beyond the illuminated object. 
4.  For upward-directed architectural, landscape and decorative lighting, direct light emissions shall not be visible above the building line roof. 
E.  Height Standards for Lighting. All exterior lighting luminaires shall be mounted no higher than fifteen (15) feet, except that lighting in parking lots containing more than one hundred (100) spaces shall have a maximum height of twenty-five (25) feet. 
F.  Street Lighting. Lighting for public or private streets shall be shielded. 
(Ord. 8-05 #1, 6/14/05; Ord. 29-16, § 1(Exh. A), 12/15/16; Ord. 09-17, § 1(Exh. A), 3/28/17)  
§ 7.10 - OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 
In addition to any standards required in the underlying zoning districts, all development shall meet the following performance standards: 
A.  Noise. All land uses and new development subject to this Code shall comply with the noise standards found in Larimer County Ordinance 97-03 (adopted September 22, 1997, and as amended from time to time).

1.  Placement of trash receptacles; 
2.  Location of loading and delivery areas; 
3.  Location, intensity and hours of illumination; and 
4.  Additional landscaping and buffering. 
C.  Evidence of Compliance. The Decision-Making Body shall require such evidence of ability to comply with appropriate performance standards and mitigation measures as it deems necessary prior to issuance of project development plan approval or a building permit or a certificate of occupancy.  
§ 7.11 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 
A.  Applicability.   
1.  New Development/Exemption for New Development in the CD District. The off-street parking standards of this Section shall apply to all new buildings, structures and land uses subject to this Code, except that the off-street parking and off-street loading standards of this Section shall not apply to new development and land uses in the CD Downtown Commercial zoning district. 
2.  Expansions and Alterations. The off-street parking standards of this Section shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking spaces will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use, provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking spaces provided for the entire use (pre-existing + expansion) must equal at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the minimum requirements established in §7.11.D below. 
B.  No Reduction Below Minimums. Existing parking spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements established in this Section. Any change in use or manner of operation that increases applicable off-street parking requirements will be deemed a violation of this Code unless parking spaces are provided in accordance with this Section. 
C.  Rules for Computing Parking Requirements. The following rules apply when computing off-street parking requirements: 
1.  Multiple Uses. Unless otherwise approved, off-street parking areas serving more than one (1) use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the combined total of the requirements for each use. 
2.  Fractions. When measurement of the number of required spaces results in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half (½) or less shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than one-half (½) shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
3.  Area Measurements. Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area. 
4.  Occupancy- or Capacity-Based Standards. For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable, and whichever results in the greater number of spaces. 
5.  Unlisted Uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in the off-street parking schedule below, Staff shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use, or shall establish minimum off-street parking requirements pursuant to §7.11.E below.

E.  Parking Studies.   
1.  Several use classifications or specific uses listed in the off-street parking schedule above have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to this Section (as cross-referenced in the above off-street parking schedule), Staff shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or shall establish minimum off-street parking requirements on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the Applicant. 
2.  The parking and loading study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by Staff, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. 
F.  Location.   
1.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section, required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the principal use. (See Off-Street Parking Alternatives, §7.11.G below.) 
2.  In all nonresidential zoning districts except the CH district, off-street parking shall not be located within the required front yard setback area. In the CD district, off-street parking shall also not be located between the lot line and the building line parallel to an arterial or collector street. See also §4.4.D.3, "Vehicular Access and Circulation Requirements." 
3.  All off-street parking areas shall be separated from arterial street property lines by a landscaped buffer area at least twenty-five (25) feet wide, and from other street property lines by a landscaped buffer area at least fifteen (15) feet wide. See §7.5.F, "Buffering and Screening," and Figure 7-9 above. 
4.  See §7.6.F for required parking areas setbacks from delineated river/stream corridors and wetlands. 
5.  Parking for single-family and two-family dwellings may be located in residential driveways (excluding RVs and boats). 
6.  Guest Parking. Shared driveways may not be counted toward the guest parking requirements unless it is demonstrated the design will not interfere with adjoining traffic movements. Guest parking shall be located to provide convenient access to all units and shall be dispersed throughout the site. 
(Ord. 25-07 §1) 
G.  Off-Street Parking Alternatives. Staff shall be authorized to approve alternatives to providing the number of off-street parking spaces required by the off-street parking schedule (See §7.11.D above) in accordance with the following standards: 
1.  Off-Site Parking. Staff may approve off-site parking facilities if the off-site parking complies with the all of following standards: 
a.  Ineligible Activities : Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking), restaurants, convenience stores or other convenience-oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site. 
b.  Location : No off-site parking space may be located more than three hundred (300) feet from the primary entrance of the use served (measured along the shortest legal pedestrian route), unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a width of more than eighty (80) feet, unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. 
c.  Zoning Classification : Off-site parking areas must be located on a site with the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the primary use served. 
d.  Agreement for Off-Site Parking : 
(1)  In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement in a form approved by Staff between the record owners will be required. The agreement must guarantee the use of the off-site parking area for at least ten (10) years. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to Staff for recordation. 
(2)  Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with the off-street parking schedule. (See subsection D above.) No use shall be continued if the off-site parking is removed unless Staff is notified at least sixty (60) days prior to the termination of a lease for the off-site parking and substitute parking facilities are provided. 
2.  Shared Parking. Staff may approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with the all of following standards: 
a.  Location . Shared parking spaces must be located within three hundred (300) feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. 
b.  Zoning Classification . Shared parking areas must be located on a site with the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the primary uses served. 
c.  Shared Parking Study . Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to Staff that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must be provided in a form established by Staff and must be made available to the public. It must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. 
d.  Agreement for Shared Parking . A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to Staff for recordation in a form established by the Town or County Attorney. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the shared parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the off-street parking schedule. (See subsection D. above.) 
3.  Other Eligible Alternatives. Staff may approve any other alternative to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the Applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of Staff that the proposed plan will protect surrounding neighborhoods, maintain traffic circulation patterns and promote quality urban design to at least the same extent as would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. 
H.  Use of Off-Street Parking Areas. Required off-street parking areas are to be used solely for the parking of licensed, motor vehicles in operating condition. Required spaces may not be used for the display of goods for sale or lease or for long-term storage of vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile homes or building materials.

§ 9.1 - Purposes 
In order that the public health, safety and general welfare may be furthered in an era of increasing urbanization, commercial and industrial development, and growing demand for housing of all types and design, this Chapter is designed to encourage planned unit developments (PUDs) in the Estes Valley for the following purposes: 
A.  To encourage innovations in residential and commercial development and renewal so that the growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to such buildings; 
B.  To encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that resulting economies may inure to the benefit of those who need homes; 
C.  To provide a process that can relate the type, design and layout of residential and commercial development to the particular site, thereby encouraging the preservation of the site's natural characteristics, and to encourage integrated planning in order to achieve the purposes of this Chapter; 
D.  To provide for well-located, commercial sites and well-designed residential developments while minimizing the impact on roads, streets and other transportation facilities; and 
E.  To conserve the value of the land.  
§ 9.2 - APPLICABILITY AND TYPES OF PUDS ALLOWED 
A.  PUDs Allowed in the CO District Only. Application for a planned unit development may be made for land located in the CO Outlying Commercial Zoning District. A PUD may be established by overlaying a PUD development plan over the existing CO zoning district. All PUDs shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the standards set forth in this Chapter and the procedures set forth in Chapter 3 of this Code. 
B.  Types of PUDs Allowed. A Mixed-Use Planned Unit Development (PUD-M) shall be the only permitted PUD overlay in the CO zoning district.  
§ 9.3 - PUD-M, PLANNED MIXED-USE DISTRICT 
The PUD-M, Planned Mixed-Use District, is created to provide for the development of planned mixed-use commercial and residential developments. It is intended to promote developments with a balanced mix of commercial and residential uses that provide services and employment opportunities in close proximity to residents of the district. The PUD-M, Planned Mixed-Use District, may be permitted as an overlay only in the CO Outlying Commercial District. Within a PUD-M District, the following standards shall be applied and uses and densities may be permitted subject to the approval of the Decision-Making Body, depending on the location of the proposed PUD. 
A.  Permitted Uses. Within a PUD-M district, the following uses may be permitted subject to the approval of the Decision-Making Body: 
1.  Uses permitted by-right or by special review in the underlying zoning district; 
2.  Residential uses; or 
3.  Accommodation uses. 
B.  Minimum Parcel Size. The minimum parcel size of a mixed-use PUD shall be three (3) acres. 
C.  Number of Units Allowed/Density.

2.  Accommodation Uses in a Mixed-Use PUD. The maximum number of accommodation units allowed shall be determined by applying the minimum developable land area per accommodations unit requirement allowed in the A Accommodations/Highway Corridor Zoning District (see §4.4.C above). Any unit that is less than or equal to eight hundred (800) square feet in size shall be considered a guest unit, regardless of kitchen configuration, for purposes of density calculations of a commercial accommodations use in a Mixed-Use PUD. 
(Ord. 17-03 #1) 
3.  Land Area Requirements Not Cumulative. The density allowances set forth in this Section are not cumulative, but shall be calculated independently for each residential and/or accommodations use proposed in a mixed-use PUD. Each independently calculated land area shall be deducted from the total land area available for development to determine the permitted density on a site. 
D.  Applicable Development Standards. 
1.  Yard, Bulk and Dimensional Requirements. Yard, bulk and dimensional requirements set forth in Chapter 4, including but not limited to minimum lot area, shall not apply to interior lots or building sites within a PUD-M that do not abut land uses located outside the PUD-M development parcel.

B.  No Guarantee of Density. The provisions of this Chapter shall not be interpreted as guarantees of achievable density. Developments using bonus provisions shall be subject to all other applicable regulations of this Code. These other regulations or site-specific conditions may prevent maximum bonus density levels from being achieved due to the character of the land or surrounding uses. 
C.  Review and Approval Procedure.   
1.  Projects requesting bonuses under this Chapter for land that has not been platted, or for land that is being re-platted, shall be reviewed during the subdivision process, as set forth in Chapter 3 of this Code. 
2.  Projects requesting bonuses under this Chapter that have already completed the subdivision process shall be required to submit a Development Plan, and shall be reviewed under the Development Plan process as set forth in Chapter 3. 
3.  A separate rezoning process shall not be necessary to approve the density increases granted through these processes.  
§ 11.3 - OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENTS 
A.  Purpose. To provide an optional method for residential site planning that permits clustering of individual lots in order to: 
1.  Preserve open space in amounts that are greater than that achievable with more conventional subdivision design and thereby help to preserve the Estes Valley's natural character and scenic vistas; 
2.  Protect environmentally sensitive areas such as steep slopes and ridgelines, unique rock formations and outcroppings, river systems, wetlands and wildlife habitat and migration corridors; and 
3.  Promote a more flexible and economical residential layout and street design to provide a more efficient and aesthetic use of open space and to reduce infrastructure costs. 
B.  Eligibility. Residential open space developments are permitted in the RE-1, RE and E-1 zoning districts. 
C.  Maximum Permitted Density Bonus. At the Decision-Making Body's sole discretion, and subject to the standards and review criteria set forth in this Section, open space developments may be eligible for a density bonus up to one and two-tenths (1.2) times (20%) of the base density standard set forth in Table 4-2, §4.3.C. 
D.  Uses Permitted. Open space developments shall contain only single-family detached residential uses permitted in the underlying district. 
E.  Development and Design Standards.   
1.  Minimum Parcel Size. Ten (10) acres.

c.  Exception for Open Space Development on Steep Slopes . Cluster lots with an average slope of greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be subject to the lot area adjustment set forth in §7.1.A of this Code. The minimum lot areas set forth in this subsection shall be used as the base for any required increase in lot area due to steep slopes. 
3.  Maximum Lots per Cluster. Each cluster of residential lots shall contain ten (10) lots or fewer and shall be separated from any other cluster on the property by a protected open area or vegetative buffer. 
4.  Open Areas.   
a.  Minimum Amounts Required . Open space developments shall provide the following minimum amount of private and/or public open areas: 
Zoning District 	Minimum Open Areas (% of Gross Land Area) 
RE-1 	70% 
RE 	50% 
E-1 	40% 
 
(Ord. 11-02 §1) 
b.  Permanently Protected from Development . Prior to construction, such open areas shall be permanently preserved as open areas by the recording of a conservation easement or deed restriction. All open areas in an open space development not dedicated to a public entity shall be conveyed to a homeowner's association or other organization approved by the applicable Decision-Making Body with responsibility for maintenance of the open areas and the ability to collect assessments or dues for such purpose. 
c.  Contiguity . Open areas shall be designed to achieve the maximum contiguous amount of open area possible and to avoid the creation of small, isolated and unusable areas. Such lands shall not be fragmented into small, unconnected areas by development. 
d.  Connectivity . To the maximum extent feasible, open areas shall be located contiguous to and be connected with other open areas on the site or with open areas that are adjacent to the open space development boundaries. Where applicable, physical connections for wildlife movement shall be provided within the protected open areas. 
e.  Compliance with Other Standards . All open areas, whether private or dedicated for public use, shall comply with all other open area standards set forth in §7.4, "Public Trails and Private Open Areas," of this Code. 
5.  Setbacks and Buffers.   
a.  Building Setbacks . Except as specified in subsection 5.b below, building and structure setbacks and yard requirements for individual cluster lots shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the applicable Decision-Making Body during the development review procedures. All setback and yard determinations shall take as their starting point the minimum setback and yard requirements set forth in §4.3.C.2 of this Code for the underlying base zoning district, and shall consider factors such as minimization of land disturbance and avoidance of potential impacts on sensitive environmental areas, hazard areas, scenic views and adjacent residential land uses. A setback of ten (10) feet from property lines adjacent to open areas is required. 
b.  Building Setbacks and Resource Protection . All development within an open space development shall comply with the setback (no disturbance) requirements set forth in Chapter 7 to protect and preserve wetlands, stream and river corridors, ridgelines, wildlife habitat and hazard areas. See §§7.1.D, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 of this Code. 
c.  Perimeter Buffer Required . A minimum thirty-foot-wide buffer shall be established along the perimeter of the open space development property. Such buffer shall be kept free of buildings, structures and parking areas, and shall be landscaped, screened or protected by natural features in order to minimize potential adverse impacts on surrounding land uses and properties. 
F.  Review Criteria for Approval of Open Space Developments. All open space developments shall comply with all other applicable provisions, as set forth in this Code, and the following review criteria: 
1.  Site Design. The open space development, compared with a more conventional site development plan, better attains the policies and objectives of this Code and the Comprehensive Plan, such as providing more open areas, preserving existing trees and vegetation coverage, protecting wildlife habitats and preserving sensitive environmental areas such as river/stream corridors, hazard areas, wetlands and steep slopes; and 
2.  Impacts on Surrounding Properties.

(Ord. 8-05 #1, 6/14/05) 
VIII.  TREE AND VEGETATION PROTECTION DURING CONSTRUCTION AND GRADING ACTIVITIES   
A.  Fencing.   
1.  Within the limits of disturbance, fencing, at a minimum, should be placed around each significant tree and around stands of twelve (12) or more smaller trees a distance equal to the size of the individual or outermost tree's drip zone. 
2.  For purposes of this subsection, the drip zone is calculated by measuring the diameter of the tree at breast height; every inch of diameter is equal to one and one-half (1.5) feet of drip zone. For example, a twelve-inch-diameter tree will require a minimum eighteen-foot-wide drip zone. 
3.  No construction, grading, equipment or material storage, or any other activity shall be allowed within this area, and the fencing shall remain in place until all land alteration, construction and development activities are completed. 
B.  Root Protection.   
1.  If it is necessary to fill over the root zone, compacted soils shall be avoided by sandwiching fabric, rocks and more fabric under the area to be filled. 
2.  Fill placed directly on the roots shall not exceed a maximum of six (6) inches in depth. 
3.  If fill creates a tree well or depression around a tree or shrubs, such area shall be drained so that the vegetation is not drowned by the pooling of rainfall or irrigation. 
4.  Utility trenches near trees should be avoided. If a line must be near a tree, tunneling, auguring or other mitigation measure shall be used. Cutting more than thirty percent (30%) of the roots endangers the health of the tree, and over forty percent (40%) affects the tree's stability. 
IX.  OTHER REQUIREMENTS   
A.  Construction Approval. All subdivisions shall be designed and improvements made by the developer consistent with the requirements in this Code.
