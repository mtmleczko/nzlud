PREAMBLE
The Emporia city code, originally published by Municipal Code Corporation in 1983, has been kept
current by regular supplementation. In 1995, Sterling Codifiers began providing supplement service for
the city code.
The city code of the city of Emporia, as supplemented, contains ordinances up to and including
ordinance 16-44, passed November 2, 2016. Ordinances of the city adopted after said ordinance
supersede the provisions of this city code to the extent that they are in conflict or inconsistent therewith.
Consult the city office in order to ascertain whether any particular provision of the code has been
amended, superseded or repealed.

PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Emporia, Kansas, of a
general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such
ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto.
The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are
catchlined to facilitate usage. Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the City's 1962
Code and Ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is
included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use
of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the
1962 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the
state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within
the Code is included at the back of this volume.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government
codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the
dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section
within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second of chapter 3 is 3-
2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or
even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for
amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come
between sections 2-2 and 2-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 2-2.1, 2-
2.2 and 2-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to
be included between chapters 14 and 15 it will be designated as chapter 14.5. Care should be taken that
the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 3/510
new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of
the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
embracing the subject, the next successive numbering being assigned to the article or division.
Index
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under
several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology
and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item
in which he is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the
Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be
properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to
holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting
the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part
thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance.
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of
the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have
the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the
publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them
and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and
Roger D. Merriam, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully
given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance
throughout this project.
The publishers are most grateful to the officials of the City of Emporia for their cooperation and
assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the
publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily
accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's
affairs.

who is providing services to the city but who does not serve in an official capacity. Employee does
include former employees for acts and omissions within the scope of their employment during their
former employment with the city.
(b) As a condition of service or employment with the city, the city shall provide an employee, subject to
the conditions and requirements of this section, and notwithstanding the fact that such employee may
have concluded service or employment with the city, such defense as may be reasonably necessary
to defend any claim, civil action, or proceeding filed against such employee, in his or her official or
individual capacity or both, on account of an act or omission in the scope of his or her employment as
an employee of the city.
(c) The city may provide for a defense by the city attorney or by employing other counsel for this purpose
or by purchasing insurance which requires that the insurer provide the defense. The city has no right
to recover such expenses from the employee defended, except as otherwise provided herein.
(d) The city may refuse to provide for the defense of an action against an employee if the city determines
that:
(1) The act or omission was not within the scope of such employee's employment;
(2) Such employee acted or failed to act because of actual fraud or actual malice;
(3) The lawsuit or other legal proceeding was brought by or on behalf of the city.
(e) The provisions of this section shall be applicable, provided that the following conditions are met:
(1) The employee shall in writing request the city to provide for the defense of the employee within
fifteen (15) days after service of any claim, demand, notice or summons or other process upon the
employee. Such written request shall be filed together with the claim, demand, notice or summons or
other process with the city manager. The city, in its discretion, may provide requested defense for
any of its employees who fail to make a request within the time prescribed by this subsection.
(2) In addition to the notice provided in subsection (1), the employee shall, as soon as practical, give
further notice identifying the officers or employees involved, all information known to the employee
involved, all information known to the employee with respect to the date, time, place, and
circumstances surrounding the incident or conduct giving rise to the claim or proceeding, as well as
the names and addresses of all persons allegedly injured or otherwise damaged thereby, and the
names and addresses of all witnesses.
(3) The employee shall cooperate with the city attorney or other attorney designated by the city and
employed for the provision of defense, and, upon request, assist in making settlements of any suits
and enforcing any claim or any right of contribution or indemnity against any person or organization
who may be liable to the city because of any damage or claim of loss arising from said incident or
course of conduct.

securing and giving evidence and obtaining attendance of witnesses; and
(5) Such employee shall not accept nor voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation, or
incur any expense, other than for first aid, to others at the time of any incident or course of conduct
giving rise to any such claim, loss, or damage.
(f) If legal representation of an employee is undertaken by the city, all conditions of representation are
met, and a judgment is entered against the employee, or a settlement made, the city shall pay such
judgment or settlement, provided, that the city may, at its discretion appeal as necessary such
judgment. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the city shall not be liable for any
punitive or exemplary damages against an employee unless the city in its discretion shall determine
such damages shall be paid by the city, nor for the payment of any costs, judgments, or settlements
which are paid through an applicable contractor policy of insurance.
(g) In the event that an employee fails or refuses to comply with any of the conditions of this section, or
elects to provide his or her own representation with respect to any such claim or litigation, then all the
provisions of this section shall be inapplicable, and have no force or effect with respect to any such
claim or litigation.
(h) If the city determines that an employee does not come within the provisions of this section, and thus
fails or refuses to provide an employee with a defense, and a court of competent jurisdiction later
determines that such claim does come within the provisions of this section, then the city shall pay
any judgment rendered against the employee and reasonable costs and fees incurred by the
employee in defending against the claim. The city shall additionally pay any attorneys' fees incurred
in obtaining the determination that such claim is covered by the provisions of this section. Nothing in
this section shall be construed to deprive an employee of the right to petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to compel the city to perform the duties imposed by this section.

section, and if the employee fails to cooperate in good faith in the defense of the claim or action or if
a court of competent jurisdiction later finds that such claim does not come within the provisions of this
section, then the city shall be reimbursed for any payments made by it for any judgment, or portion
thereof, and costs or fees incurred by or on behalf of the employee's defense and the city shall also
be reimbursed for costs or expenses incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is not
covered by the provisions of this section.
(1) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to modify or amend any provision of any
policy of insurance or any employee thereof as a named insured. In the event of any conflict between
this section and the provisions of any such policy of insurance, the policy provisions shall be
controlling; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to limit or
restrict any employee's right to full coverage pursuant to this section, it being the intent of this section
to provide complete coverage outside and beyond insurance policies which may be in effect, while
not compromising the terms and conditions of such policies by any conflicting provisions contained in
this section.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be additionally construed as abrogating or waiving any limitation of
liability presently or hereinafter made applicable to the city or its employees which would otherwise
be applicable in any action or proceeding to which this section would apply.
(j) The provisions of this section shall apply to any pending claim or lawsuit against an employee, or any
such claim or lawsuit hereafter filed, irrespective of the date of the events or circumstances which are
the basis of such claim or lawsuit. Provided, however, that in any pending claim, action, or
proceeding for which the city is currently providing defense for an employee that such employee shall
not be required to provide a written request for the provision of defense. (Ord. No. 86-4, § 1, 3-12-86)

maintenance appeal board, at a date and time to be set and identified in the notice, for determining
whether to revoke or cancel the permit as in its judgment will best serve and protect the public health
and welfare of the city. Any permits issued shall be issued for a period of one year. No new permit

(b)It is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of any narcotic, hypnotic, somnifacient or
stimulating drug or who is under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders such
person incapable of safely operating an aircraft to operate an aircraft within this city. The fact that any
person charged with a violation of this subsection is or has been entitled to use such drug under the
laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against any charge of violating this section.
(c)Every person who is convicted of a violation of either subsection (a) or (b) shall be punished by
imprisonment of not more than one year, or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00)

otherwise taken into custody for any offense involving operating an aircraft under the influence of
intoxicating liquor in violation of a state statute or a city ordinance and the arresting officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that prior to arrest the person was operating an aircraft under the
influence of intoxicating liquor. The test shall be administered at the direction of a law enforcement
officer. If a law enforcement officer requests the arrested person to submit to a chemical test of
blood, the withdrawal of blood at the direction of the officer may be performed only by:

opportunity to have an additional chemical test by a physician of such person's own choosing. If the
law enforcement officer refuses to permit such additional chemical test to be taken, the original test
shall not be competent evidence.
(g)In any criminal prosecution for violation of subsection (a) or (b), evidence of the amount of alcohol in
the defendant's blood at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the defendant's blood,
urine, breath or other bodily substance may be admitted and shall give rise to the following
presumptions:
(1) If there was at that time less than 0.10 percent by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, it
shall be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
(2) If there was at the time 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, it shall
be presumed that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
(h)For the purpose of this section, percent by weight of alcohol shall be based upon grams of alcohol per
one hundred milliliters (100 ml) of blood.
(i)Upon the request of any person submitting to a chemical test under this act, a report of the test shall
be delivered to such person.
(j)Subsection (g) of this section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent

Secs. 8-6-8-15. Reserved:
ARTICLE III. ABANDONED AND VACANT BUILDINGS
Sec. 8-16. Purpose; Definitions:
(a) Purpose: Recognizing that abandoned and vacant buildings contribute to blight in both residential
and nonresidential neighborhoods, discourage economic development and retard appreciation of
property values, endanger public health and safety, attract criminal activity, and create fire hazards, it
is the responsibility of property owners to prevent buildings from becoming a burden to the
neighborhood and community and a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. The governing
body finds that abandoned and vacant buildings result in increased expenditures for police, fire, and
code services inspections and calls. Maintenance of the public health, safety, and welfare thus
requires the city to maintain an accurate registration of all abandoned and vacant buildings.
(b)Definitions:
Abandoned Building: For purposes of this article: 1) a building that is unoccupied and is not used as
a place of residence or business, 2) a building that is open or unsecured so that unauthorized
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer

admittance may be gained; or 3) a building that does not have electrical service provided by a
metered franchisee of the city.
Building: A building, accessory structure, or other structure adapted to permanent occupancy for
residential or commercial purposes.
Chronic Vacancy: 1) Abandoned building; or 2) vacant building which continues for six (6) months
after initial notification by the city without meeting the marketing requirements under subsection 8-
17(b) of this chapter.
City: The city of Emporia, Kansas.
Commercial: Any "nonresidential structure" as defined in the Emporia building and construction
regulations, appendix E, article XIV, section 2 of this code.

Further, any sale or transfer and the consent thereto, shall comply with applicable law requirements.
Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise and/or the cable
system without the consent of the City, except as otherwise provided herein, shall be null and void.
The granting of a security interest in any of franchisee's assets, or any mortgages or other
hypothecation, shall not be considered a transfer for the purposes of this Section.
(b) Any change of control of franchisee shall be deemed to be a "sale" or "transfer" of the franchise. A
"change of control" shall include any stock sale by franchisee to, or any merger or consolidation with,
any person (or group of persons acting in concert) who is not an affiliate of franchisee before such
transaction.
(c) The franchisee must comply with provisions of the Cable Act regarding transfers of ownership and

the City as notice that a change in control or ownership of the franchise has taken place and the
provisions under this Section governing the consent of the City to such change in control or
ownership shall apply.
(e) For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such a change, transfer, or acquisition of
control, the City may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party,
and the franchisee shall assist the City in any such inquiry. In seeking the City's consent to any
change in ownership or control, the franchisee shall have the responsibility of ensuring that the
transferee completes an application, which application shall include the information required under
State and Federal law. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the legal,
technical, and financial qualifications to operate and maintain the system and comply with all
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 110/510
franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. The City can consider the
legal, technical, and financial qualifications of the transferee as well as whether the proposed transfer
will adversely affect the City's subscribers. The City can also consider the ability of the proposed
transferee to complete any system upgrade as specified in the franchise agreement. If, after
considering the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the applicant, as well as the effect
upon the City's subscribers, and determining that they are satisfactory, the City shall approve the
transfer of rights and obligations of said franchise.
(f) The franchisee shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs incurred by the City as a result of the
transfer process, including outside consultant fees. Such reimbursement, when combined with the
franchise fee imposed by a franchise agreement, shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the
franchisee's gross revenues for that year. In the event that the costs incurred by the City will not be
fully reimbursed in a given year due to the five percent (5%) limit, such amount may be carried
forward for reimbursement in future years. However, such amounts may not be carried forward for
more than three (3) years after the year the costs are incurred.

for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that it or its
designee satisfactory to the City shall take control of and operate the cable television system, in the
event of a franchisee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also
submit a plan for such operation within thirty (30) days of assuming such control that will assure
continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over
the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the City in its discretion and during
said period of time it shall have the right to petition the City to transfer the franchise to another
franchisee.
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no such prior consent shall be required for
any transfer or assignment to any person controlling, controlled by or under the same common
control as the franchisee. (Ord. 98-15, § 3.10, 6-3-1998)

of the franchisee's cable system serving the City.

service area, franchisee shall provide cable service to any requesting subscriber within that service
area within thirty (30) days from the date of request, provided that the franchisee is able to secure all

agents or employees, by reason of its construction, operation or maintenance of its system. Such
damages and penalties shall include, but not be limited to, damages arising out of copyright

final judgment being obtained against the City, either independently or jointly with the franchisee,
solely by reason of the acts of the franchisee, the franchisee shall pay said judgment and all costs
and hold the City harmless therefrom. However, the franchisee may not enter into any compromise,
settlement, resolution, or disposition of a claim or proceeding that may create or impose liability for
the City without obtaining the City's written consent thereto. In order for the City to assert its rights to
be indemnified and held harmless, the City must:

business in Kansas and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the franchisee to meet its
obligations under this Article and the franchise.

be.
(5) It shall be the obligation of franchisee to promptly notify the City of any pending or threatened
litigation that would be likely to affect the franchisee's insurance coverage.
(d) Nonwaiver : Neither the provisions of this Section, nor any bonds accepted by the City pursuant
thereto, nor any damages recovered by the City thereunder shall be construed to excuse unfaithful
performance by the franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under this Article or the franchise
for damages, either to the full amount of the bond, or otherwise. (Ord. 98-15, § 3.21, 6-3-1998)

other obligations to the franchisee are honored. In the event that the franchisee elects to rebuild,
modify, or sell the system, or the City gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this
franchise, the franchisee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted service.
(b) In the event of a change of the franchisee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the
franchisee shall cooperate with the City's new franchisee or operator in maintaining continuity of
cable service to all subscribers. During such period, franchisee shall be entitled to the revenues for
any period during which it operates the system and shall be entitled to reasonable cost for its
services when it no longer operates the system.
(c) In the event the franchisee fails to operate the system for three (3) consecutive days without approval
of the City, the City may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as
the franchisee restores cable service under conditions acceptable to the City or a permanent
operator is selected. This Section shall not apply if the cable operator is unable to operate the system
due to force majeure as defined in Section 8.5-70 of this Article. If the City is required to fulfill this
obligation for the franchisee, the franchisee shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs or
damages in excess of revenue from the system received by the City that are a result of the

DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL 48
ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Secs. 10-1-10-15. Reserved.
ARTICLE II. FLOOD HAZARD AREAS DIVISION
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Sec. 10-16. Statutory authorization.
The state legislature has K.S.A. 12-705, 12-707, 12-710, 12-734, 12-735 delegated the responsibility to
local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-17. Findings of fact.
(a) The floor hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated.
(Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-18. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 131/510
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight area;
(7) To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area; and
(8) To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their
actions.
(Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-19. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion or to flood heights or velocities.
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damage.
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodway
waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-20. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted as to give
them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application:
Actuarial or risk premium rates means those rates established by the administrator pursuant to individual
community studies and investigations which are undertaken to provide floor insurance in accordance
with Section 1307 of the Act and the accepted actuarial principles. "Risk premium rates" include
provisions for operating costs and allowances.
Appeal means a request for a review of the planning development director's interpretation of any
provision of this article or a request for a variance.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) with a one percent of greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of three (3) feet,
where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Base flood means the flood having one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year.
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 132/510
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not
limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations.
Existing construction means (for the purposes of determining rate) structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRM'S
effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures."
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
(1) The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
(2) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the flood insurance
study has delineated the flood hazard boundaries and the zones establishing insurance rates applicable
to the community.
Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary/floodway map and the water surface
elevation of the base flood.
Floodway or regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing
the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Floodway fringe is that area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway, that on the average is likely to be
flooded once every one hundred (100) years (i.e., that has a one percent chance of flood occurrence in
any one year).
Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of
floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could
contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect or urbanization of
the watershed.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction
next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or
flood-resistant enclosure, useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided such enclosure is not
built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this
article.
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to
the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes
park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred
eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include
park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two
(2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 133/510
New construction means structures for which the "start of construction" or substantial improvement is
commenced on or after the effective date of the FIRM.
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal
Barrier Resources Act [Pub. L. 97-3481]), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or
other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as a
manufactured home, and a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either (1) before the
improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term
does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe
living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a
state inventory of historic places.
Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article which permits construction in
a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship. (Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-21. Scope.
This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the city limits as now or hereafter may
be established. (Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-22. Compliance required.
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
(Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-23. Nonconforming uses.
(a) A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment
of this article, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this article, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
(1) No such use or substantial improvement of the use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or
altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 134/510
(2) If such use is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months, any future use of the building
premises shall conform to this article. The water department and the K.P.&L. Gas Service shall notify
the planning and development director in writing of instances of uses where utility services have
been discontinued for a period of nine (9) months.
(b) If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be
reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before
such damage occurred, except that if it is to be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this
article. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local
health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. (Ord. No. 87-
25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-24. Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration through a scientific
and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Emporia, Kansas," dated
April, 1979, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps and
any revision thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The flood
insurance study is on file at the office of the director of planning and development. (Ord. No. 87-25, § 1,
9-2-87)
Sec. 10-25. Interpretation.
This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions; however, where this article and another ordinance conflict or overlap, whichever imposes
the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. In the interpretation and application of this article all
provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the government body; and
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor to repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. No. 87-
25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-26. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply
that land outside the areas of special flood hazards, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-27. Amendments.
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this article may from time to time be amended,
supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973; provided, however, that no such action may be taken, until after a public hearing
in relation thereto, at which parties in interest, and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. At
least twenty (20) days' notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in the official city

DIVISION 3. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 10-56. Generally.
In all areas of special flood hazards (zones A, AE, A1-30, AO, AH), the following provisions are required:
(1) All new construction, including manufactured homes and substantial improvements, shall be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by materials and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage.
(3) All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices
that minimize flood damage.
(4) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
(5) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
(6) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
(7) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination
from them during flooding.
(8) The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive,
or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(9) Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods
and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
(10) That until a floodway has been designated, no development, including landfill, may be permitted
within zones A1-30 and AE on the city's FIRM unless the applicant for the land use has
demonstrated that the proposed use, when combined with all other existing and reasonably
anticipated uses, will not increase the water surface elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood
more than one foot on the average cross section of the reach in which the development or landfill is
located as shown on the flood insurance rate study incorporated by reference.
(Ord. No. 87-25, § 1, 9-2-87)
Sec. 10-57. Areas where base flood elevation known.
In all areas of special flood hazards, where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in
section 10-24, the following provisions are required:

ARTICLE III. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 1
Sec. 10-70. Applicability:
The provisions of this article shall extend and apply to all land within the corporate limits of the city.
Except as hereinafter provided, any person, firm, corporation or business proposing to construct
buildings or develop land within the above described areas shall make application to the city engineer for
approval of a stormwater management plan which controls and/or detains stormwater. The provisions of
this article shall be known, cited and referred to as the STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
OF THE CITY. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-71. Interpretation:
The provisions of this article are intended to supplement existing zoning and land use ordinances and
regulations of the city 1. In their interpretation and application, the provisions herein shall be held to be
the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Additionally, the provisions of this article should be read in conjunction and not in conflict with any
applicable state or federal statute, law, rule or regulation. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-72. Objectives:
To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Emporia, this stormwater
management ordinance is enacted for the general purpose of assuring the proper balance between the
use of land and the environment. Specifically, the provisions of this article are intended to reduce
property damage and to minimize the hazards of personal injury and loss of life due to flooding through
the establishment of a stormwater management system and the establishment of methods and
guidelines for attenuating or avoiding flooding within the city from the cumulative effects of increased
volume and peak discharge of surface water runoff. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-73. Disclaimer Of Liability:
The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein establish minimum requirements which
must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship. Use of the requirements
contained herein shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the city, or
its officers and employees. The approval of a stormwater management plan shall not imply that the land
uses permitted will be free from damages caused by stormwater runoff. The requirements of this article
were established to consider historical records of average rainfall and engineering and scientific
methods. However, larger storms may occur or stormwater runoff heights may be increased by
manmade or natural causes. The provisions of this Article, therefore, shall not be deemed to create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof with respect to any legislative or
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-74. Stormwater Management Plan Required:
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 142/510
It shall be the developer's responsibility to submit a stormwater management plan, prepared by a
licensed professional engineer or architect, to the City Engineer in those cases as hereinafter required.
The plan shall show that there will not be an increase in the quantity and rates of stormwater emanating
from the development area except in accordance with an approved stormwater management plan as
provided in this Article.
A stormwater management plan shall be submitted in the following instances, unless specially excepted
by Section 10-75 of this Article:
(1) All new subdivision plats or replats.
(2) Development in all commercial districts.
(3) Development in all industrial districts.
(4) As part of a preliminary plan for a planned unit development.
(5) Building permit applications of more than one-half (1/2) acre.
No building permits shall be issued and no final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning
Commission prior to the approval of the stormwater management plan by the City Engineer. (Ord. 95-32,
§ 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-75. Exceptions:
Exceptions to the requirement for submittal of a stormwater management plan required in Section 10-74
of this Article are as follows:
(1) New construction of only one single-family, or two-family dwelling unit regardless of the site area
which the structure is to occupy.
(2) Additions, improvements or repair of existing single-family or two-family dwelling unit structures.
(3) Construction of any buildings or future improvements on a site, which has been previously
provided with approved stormwater management control facilities as a part of a larger unit of
development.
(4) Improvement on a site having a gross land area of one-half (1/2) acre or less, regardless of the
land use.
(5) Remodeling, repair, replacement, and improvements to any existing structure or facility and
appurtenances that do not cause an increase in the rate of discharge from the site in excess of ten
percent (10%) of the previously existing condition. Incremental development of a single tract of land
will require a stormwater management plan when the development exceeds an increase of ten
percent (10%) of the predeveloped condition for the entire development or tract of land.
(6) If the developer can show through an engineering study that the detention of stormwater runoff
will be detrimental to the drainage basin or that there is no benefit to development downstream. (Ord.
95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-76. Methods Of Determining Stormwater Runoff:
In determining the amount of stormwater runoff from a development, the rational method shall be used
where the area contributing runoff is twenty five (25) acres or less. Where the contributing runoff area is
over twenty five (25) acres, the development shall be designed using the unit hydrograph method. The
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 143/510
preferred method of hydrograph development shall be as described in the Soil Conservation Service
publication "Urban Hydrology For Small Watersheds" (Technical Release 55-January, 1975). Use of
methods other than those described above shall be only upon prior approval of the City Engineer. (Ord.
95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-77. Volume Of Stormwater Detention:
The required volume for stormwater detention shall be calculated on a minimum basis of the runoff for
the following areas of development:
One-half (1/2) to two (2) acres: 10-year frequency rainfall, erosion control not required.
Two (2) acres to five (5) acres: 25-year frequency rainfall, erosion control not required.
Over five (5) acres: drainage impact study and detention for a 100-year frequency rainfall event is
required and an erosion control plan is required.
The rainfall intensity will not be less than the values listed in the report developed for the KTRAN
Research Program for KDOT entitled "Rainfall Intensity Tables for Counties in Kansas" taken from the
Lyon County rainfall data and a minimum storm duration of fifteen (15) minutes. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-
1995; Ord. 99-16, § 1, 7-7-1999)
Sec. 10-78. Method Of Stormwater Detention:
The methods of stormwater detention shall be at the discretion of the developer, subject to final approval
by the City Engineer. Detention may be underground or on the surface. Methods which are normally
acceptable include the following: dry bottom storage, wet bottom storage, paved area storage (limited to
a maximum depth of 7 inches), and rooftop storage. The ability to retain and maximize the ground water
recharge capacity of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the stormwater runoff control
system shall give consideration to providing ground water recharge to compensate for the reduction in
the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and roofed. The use of natural gravel
deposits for the lower portions of stormwater runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes, and
the retention of existing topography are examples of possible recharge methods. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-
1995)
Sec. 10-78.1. Method Of Erosion Control:
The methods of erosion control shall be at the discretion of the developer, subject to final approval by
the City Engineer. Methods which are normally acceptable include the following: silt fencing, riprap,
seeding, placement of hay bales and siltation ponds. (Ord. 99-16, § 2, 7-7-1999)
Sec. 10-79. Design Criteria:
All calculations relating to runoff analysis shall be based upon the proposed land use and shall take
under consideration any contributing runoff from areas adjacent to or upstream to the development site.
Stormwater runoff analysis from adjacent existing developed area shall be based upon current land
usage and topographical features. The most likely flow pattern to be utilized for an undeveloped area
shall be based upon existing natural topographical features.
The design criteria for storage facilities should include: release rate, storage volume, grading and depth
requirements, outlet works, and location. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-80. Release:
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 144/510
The release from the detention facility shall be limited to the rate of runoff from the site using a runoff
coefficient of 0.30. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-81. Rational Method; Runoff Coefficients:
The basic formula Q = CiA is the rational method for estimating rainfall runoff when:
Q = Rate of runoff in cfs
i = Average rainfall intensity
C = Runoff coefficient
A = Drainage area in acres
The following runoff coefficients shall be used:
Land Use/Zoning C
Churches-schools 0.75
Commercial 0.80
Heavy industrial 0.80
Light industrial 0.65
Parks 0.35
Permanent unimproved areas greenbelts, etc. 0.30
Residential
One- and two-family areas 0.50
Multi-family areas 0.65
As an alternate to the above coefficients or for areas not specifically listed above (planned unit
developments, shopping centers, mobile home parks, etc.), a composite runoff coefficient based on
the percentage of the different types of surfaces involved may be used.
Coefficients with respect to surface type shall not be less than 0.90 for impervious surfaces (asphalt,
concrete, or roofs) or less than 0.30 for pervious surfaces such as turf. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-82. Construction Timing:
The construction of the stormwater control system shall be completed prior to occupancy of any
development. If the amount of storage capacity can be increased to provide benefit to the City,
negotiations for public participation in the cost of development may be feasible. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-
1995)
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 145/510
Sec. 10-83. Certification Upon Completion:
Upon completion of construction and prior to occupancy of the development, the owner of each
development shall furnish certification by a licensed professional engineer or architect to the City
Engineer that the detention system has full storage capacity and all inlet and outlet structures are fully
functional. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-84. Maintenance:
The City reserves the right to inspect and require the owner to perform maintenance on private detention
facilities. Maintenance of private detention facilities shall be the responsibility of the property owner and
shall include all necessary and proper maintenance including, without limitations:
(1) Debris removal and cleaning.

The reference in this Article to City Engineer refers to the duly appointed and acting City Engineer of the
City or a licensed professional engineer appointed by the City Manager. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-86. Administrative Appeals:
All rulings, requirements, decisions, or interpretations of the City Engineer shall be final and binding
upon all parties thereto unless appealed to the City Commission. Any person aggrieved thereby shall
perfect an appeal by filing a written notice of appeal in the office of the City Clerk within ten (10) calendar
days from the date of the action complained of; all notice of appeal shall specify the grounds for the
appeal and contain a brief summary of all facts which the aggrieved party deems material to the appeal.
A hearing on the appeal shall be heard by the City Commission not later than thirty (30) days from the
date of filing the notice of appeal. (Ord. 95-32, § 1, 9-6-1995)
Sec. 10-87. Violation:
(a) Any person violating any provision of this Article, or commencing, constructing, causing, or permitting
the commencement of the construction of any stormwater detention facility without the prior written
approval of the City Engineer shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a public offense, and shall
be fined the sum of not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor more than five hundred dollars
($500.00). Every day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 168/510
written, verified complaint, which complaint shall set forth the particulars of such unlawful act or

commission, upon its own initiative, the director or the city attorney may, in like manner, make, sign,
and file such a complaint. All complaints made pursuant to this article shall be filed within one
hundred eighty (180) days following the alleged unlawful act or practice. The director shall maintain a
docket of all complaints filed.
(b)Upon the filing of a complaint, the director shall appoint two (2) investigating commissioners to
process the complaint. Appointment shall be on a rotating basis from the current membership list of
commission members. Upon appointment, the director shall notify the commissioners of their
appointment and provide to them a copy of the complaint along with any supporting documents.
(c)Not more than five (5) days after the filing of a complaint under this section, a copy thereof, together
with a brief written explanation of the procedure for processing and adjudicating such complaint, shall
be served upon the respondent, either personally or by certified mail. As part of such notification, the
respondent shall be informed of its right to submit a statement of its position with respect to the
allegations of the complaint.
(d)Within ten (10) days after notification to the respondent of the filing of the complaint, the director, with
the advice of the investigating commissioners, shall schedule a preinvestigation conference. The
conference is to be attended by the director, the investigating commissioners, the complainant, and
the respondent and shall be for the purpose of identifying the issues involved in the complaint and
the complaint's validity. The complainant and respondent may be represented by legal counsel at the
preinvestigation conference but all of the discussions shall be had personally with the complainant
and respondent with legal counsel's position being stated only upon request of an investigating
commissioner. Upon the conclusion of the preinvestigation conference, the investigating
commissioners shall make a determination as to whether probable cause exists to continue with the
complaint process. In the event the investigating commissioners cannot reach a consensus, the
deciding vote shall be cast by the chairperson, or in the chairperson's absence or participation as an
investigating commissioner, the vice chairperson of the commission. In the event no probable cause
is found to exist to continue the process, the parties shall be notified in writing by the director.
(e)If the determination is made at the preinvestigation conference that the case should be submitted for
investigation, the investigating commissioners shall make a prompt investigation of the complaint,
either personally or through the director or other staff. In conducting such investigation, the
investigating commissioners may, after due notice and after seeking the cooperation of the person or
persons involved, request access at a reasonable time to such premises, records, documents, and
other evidence as are reasonably necessary for the completion of the investigation. The investigating
commissioners may, when unable to secure access to such premises or production of or access to
such records, documents, or other evidence pertinent to the investigation of a complaint, apply to the
governing body for a remedy to compel such access to or production of records, documents, or other
materials which are relevant and material to the investigation as provided under subsection 13-
19(7)d of this article. If such remedy is issued, it shall describe with reasonable particularity the
premises to which access is to be provided and/or the records, documents, or other materials which
are to be produced.
(f)Upon completion of the investigation, the investigating commissioners shall examine the case
investigation file and shall determine whether probable cause exists for crediting the allegations of
the complaint based on the investigation documentation. Within ten (10) business days from such
determination, the director shall give written notice of said determination to both the complainant and
the respondent. In the event the investigating commissioners cannot reach a consensus, probable
cause or no probable cause, the chairperson, or in the event the chair is an investigating
commissioner or absent, the vice chairperson shall review the investigating information and shall cast
the determining vote.

(g)Following the investigation and a determination that there is probable cause to believe the allegations
contained in a complaint are true, the investigating commissioners, with the assistance of the
director, shall attempt to eliminate the unlawful act or practice by conference, conciliation and
persuasion. Such informal attempts to conciliate the dispute shall be confidential. Those present at
any conciliation conference shall be the complainant, respondent, their representatives if desired, the
investigating commissioners and the director. Failure to arrive at a satisfactory adjustment within forty
five (45) days after the respondent is notified in writing of a finding of probable cause may constitute
sufficient reason to judge efforts at conference and conciliation to be a failure. If settlement by
conference and conciliation is successful, an agreement shall be prepared stating terms and
conditions of this agreement. The terms of such conciliation agreement may include any promises

defense if it negates the existence of the mental state which the statute prescribes with respect to an
element of the crime.
(b) A person's reasonable belief that his conduct does not constitute a crime is a defense if:
(1) The crime is defined by an administrative regulation or order which is not known to him and has

(3) He acts in reliance upon an order or opinion of the Supreme Court of Kansas or a United States
Appellate court later overruled or reversed; or

defining the crime made by a public officer or agency legally authorized to interpret such statute or
ordinance.
(c) Although a person's ignorance or mistake of fact or law, or reasonable belief, as described in
subsection (b) of this section, is a defense to the crime charged, he may be convicted of an included
crime of which he would be guilty if the fact or law were as he believed it to be.

applicant or to the city; and the applicant, in defending any action on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to
assert in any action every defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf. This section is

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held
invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should
determine by a final, nonappealable order that any permit or right or any portion of this article is illegal or
unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered
as a permit with a mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60) days'
written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the

solutions, whether neutralized or not.
(5) Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, any similar objectionable or toxic
substances; or wastes exerting an excessive chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such
material received in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment works creates inhibition of the
biological activity.
(6) Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-producing substances, in such
concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the city engineer as necessary, after
treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of state, federal, or other public
agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
(7) Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life concentration as may exceed limits
established by the city engineer in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
(8) Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 10.5.
(9) Materials which exert or cause:
a. Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, fuller's earth, lime
slurries, and lime residues) or dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to sodium chloride or
sodium sulfate);
b. Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions);
c. Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements released in a discharge at a
flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW; or
d. Unusual volume flow or concentration of waste constituting "slugs," as defined herein.
(10) Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by
the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having

engineer, as required in section 28-125 of this chapter, and subject to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
(Code 1962, § 19-208(D), (E); Ord. No. 963, § 1, 8-1-79; Ord. No. 84-30, § 6, 8-1-84; Ord. No. 87-22, §
2, 8-5-87; Ord. No. 91-11, § 5, 6-5-91)
Sec. 28-124. Interceptors.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city engineer, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the city engineer, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt
and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers which, when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight.
(Code 1962, § 19-208(E); Ord. No. 963, § 1, 8-1-79)
Sec. 28-125. Pretreatment facilities.
Users shall provide necessary pretreatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve
compliance with all pretreatment standards and regulations and/or categorical pretreatment standards.
Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated
and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities shall be
acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in
the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior
to the user's initiation of the changes. In no case shall an industrial user increase the use of process
water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement.
Sec. 28-126. Control manhole.
When required by the city engineer, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes.
Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in
accordance with plans and in a location approved by the city engineer. The manhole shall be installed by
the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(Code 1962, § 19-208(G); Ord. No. 963, § 1, 8-1-79; Ord. No. 91-11, § 7, 6-5-91)
Sec. 28-127. Analysis standards.
All measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is
made in this article shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136, require the use of a
laboratory certified by KDHE for analysis of all self monitoring data or any compliance monitoring and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 393/510
of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hours composite of all
outfalls of the premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally,
but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of
all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)
(Code 1962, § 19.208(H); Ord. No. 963, § 1, 8-1-79; Ord. No. 91-11, § 8, 6-5-91)
Sec. 28-128. Specific agreements.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement of
arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength of character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern, provided that no such agreement may act to waive national categorical pretreatment
standards or other federal requirements.
(Code 1962, § 19-208(I); Ord. No. 963, § 1, 8-1-79; Ord. No. 91-11, § 9, 6-5-91)
Sec. 28-129. Accidental discharge prevention and reporting procedures.
Each user, subject to the requirements of this article, shall provide protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other substances required by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans, if required by the city engineer, showing the facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before
construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to
immediately notify the city engineer of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge,
type of waste, concentration, volume and corrective actions.
(a) Within ten (10) working days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the city
engineer a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of
any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills or other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
(b) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or any other prominent place
advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that
all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.

After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, an on-site inspection of the waste discharge
system, other systems relating to the waste discharge system, treatment systems, and other related
areas of the facility may be required. The city engineer may require a compliance schedule or
graduated timetable for improvements or installation of equipment for obtaining better wastewater
quality or achieving established standards. The standards, schedules or timetables may be stated
specifically in the permit or a separate written agreement between the city and the user. Failure to
meet the standards, schedules or timetables stated therein can result in immediate revocation of
permit.
(c) Permit conditions . Industrial waste discharge permits shall be subject to all provisions of this article
and all other regulations, user charges and fees established by the city. The conditions of the permits
shall be uniformly enforced by the city engineer in accordance with this article, the City Code, and
applicable state regulations and federal pretreatment standards or categorical pretreatment
standards. In the event of conflict between local, state or federal regulations, the most stringent
regulations shall be enforced by the city engineer.
(d) Duration of permits . Permits shall be issued or reissued for a specific time period not to exceed five
(5) years. The user shall pay a minimum of one permit fee prior to issue or reissue of a permit. The
city engineer may set up a one-time pro rata billing on each user in order to establish a specific
annual billing date for all permit holders. Unless the user chooses to pay more than a one-year
permit fee at the time of issue or reissue, the user shall be billed annually. The city shall notify the
user at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the permit. The terms and conditions of the permit
may be subject to modification and change by the city during the life of the permit as limitations or
requirements are modified and changed. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his
permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new
conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 395/510
(e) Transfer of permit . Industrial waste discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific
operation. The permit shall not be reassigned, transferred, nor sold to a new owner, new user,
different premises or a new or changed operation without the approval of the city engineer.
(f) Suspension of permit . Any user who violates any of the following conditions, conditions of the permit
or of this article or applicable state regulations and federal pretreatment standards or categorical
pretreatment standards is subject to having his permit suspended:
(1) Failure of the user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his
discharge;
(2) Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
(3) Failure of the user to obtain prior approval of the city engineer before changing or modifying its
discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
or,
(5) Violation of conditions of the permit.
If an industrial user's permit is suspended, that user will be considered to be in violation of this
section. Violators will be subject to the enforcement process outlines in section 28-72.
(g) Permit fee . An industrial waste discharge permit fee will be collected annually from all permittees at
the time of permit issuance or renewal. Fees shall be based on the city's costs of operating the city's
pretreatment program. Costs may include issuance of permits, inspection of facilities, sampling and
testing and operation of the city's wastewater laboratory and salaries of personnel. Users may also
be assessed an additional fee to cover the costs of monitoring their waste stream for compliance with
this article following a violation.
(h) No industrial user shall discharge into a POTW without first obtaining a permit as provided by this
section. The city reserves the right to deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants,
or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the POTW by industrial users where such contributions do
not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would
cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 397/510
(1) Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain
records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section. Such
records shall include for all sample:
a. The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons
taking the samples;
b. The date analyses were performed;
c. Who performed the analyses;
d. The analytical techniques/methods used; and
e. The results of such analyses.
(2) Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall be
required to retain for a minimum of three (3) years, any records of monitoring activities and results
(whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records
available for inspection and copying by the director, the regional administrator, and the POTW. This
period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the
industrial user or POTW or when requested by the director or the regional administrator.
(e) Notification of article violation . Any industrial user must notify the POTW if sampling performed by
the industrial user indicates a violation of this article, any categorical pretreatment standard and/or
pretreatment standard or requirement, or any other requirement under federal, state or local law
within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat
the sampling and submit the results to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation.
(f) Availability of reports to officials . All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall
be made available to officials of the EPA or KDHE upon their request.
(g) Reports of hazardous waste .
(1) The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge in the POTW of a substance, which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261. Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more
than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification
shall also contain the following information to the extent that such information is known and readily
available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream
discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications
must take place within one hundred eighty (180) days of July 24, 1990, the effective date of this rule.
Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the
notification no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge of the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be
submitted under 40 CFR, Section 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported under the self monitoring requirements of 40 CFR, Section
403.12(b), (d), and (e).
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 398/510
(2) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of this subsection during a calendar month in
which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes
are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR, Sections 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during
which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
(3) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste the
industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste division director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of
such regulations.
(4) In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it
has determined to be economically practical.
(h) Availability of reports to public and other governmental agencies . Except as provided in paragraph
(f) of this section, information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public
and other governmental agencies without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be
made available to other governmental agencies upon written request for uses related to this article,
the NPDES permit, the pretreatment programs or for use by the state or any state agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. Information,
accepted by the city as confidential, shall not be transmitted to the general public or any
governmental agency (other than KDHE or EPA as set forth in paragraph (f)) until or unless a ten-day
notification is given to the user.

Sec. 28-132. Bypass.
(a) Definitions .
(1) Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's
treatment facility.
(2) Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of
natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b) Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements . An industrial user may
allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be
violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) and (d) of this section.
(c) Notice .
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 399/510
(1) If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the
control authority, if possible at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass.
(2) An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards to the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of
the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the
bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour
(24) hours.
(d) Prohibition of bypass .
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial
user for a bypass, unless:
a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed
in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
c. The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if
the control authority determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of
this section.
(Ord. No. 91-11, § 13, 6-5-91)
Sec. 28-133. Upset provision.
(a) Definition . For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(b) Effect of an upset . An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c) are met.
(c) Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset . An industrial user who wishes to establish the
affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operative
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset.
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures.
(3) The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and control authority
within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 400/510
written submission must be provided within five (5) days):
a. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance.
b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the
anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue.
c. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the
noncompliance.
(d) Burden of proof . In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(e) Reviewability of agency consideration of claims of upset . In the usual exercise of prosecutorial
discretion, agency enforcement personnel should review any claims that noncompliance was caused
by an upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final agency action
subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any

specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorizations from the Building
Official, and all work regulated by these regulations shall be done in accordance with the approved
plans.
The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building, structure or building
service equipment before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building, structure or
building service equipment have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and

of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress.
3. Validity Of Permit : The issuance of a permit or approval of plans, specifications and computations
shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of
these regulations or the technical codes, or of any other ordinance of the jurisdiction. Permits
presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of these regulations or of other
ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid.
The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications and other data shall not prevent the
Building Official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, specifications and
other data, or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of
these regulations or of any other ordinances of this jurisdiction.
4. Expiration : Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provisions of these regulations shall
expire by limitation and become null and void, if the building or work authorized by such permit is not
commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of such permit, or if the building or
work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced
for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit
shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee therefor shall be one-half (1/2) the amount required for a
new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans
and specifications for such work; and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not
exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after expiration of one year, the permittee
shall pay a new full permit fee.
Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which he
may commence work under that permit when he is unable to commence work within the time
required by these regulations for good and satisfactory reasons. The Building Official may extend the
time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days upon
written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have
prevented action from being taken. No permit shall be extended more than once.
Exception : All demolition permits issued under these regulations shall expire sixty (60) days from the

permit may be renewed for a period of thirty (30) days by payment of the original permit.
5. Suspension Or Revocation : The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued
under the provisions of these regulations and the technical codes whenever the permit issued in error

days following the date of application shall expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted
for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Building Official. The
Building Official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding one
hundred eighty (180) days upon request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the

more than once. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall
resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee if such a fee is required.
5. Other Permit Fees : All fees for permits other than building permits shall be assessed on the number
of required inspections and accordance with the fee schedule listing in Table 8(A) of this Section. The
applicant for the permit shall inform the Building Official of the partial inspection requirements at the
time of application so that each of these partial inspection fees can be computed into the permit cost.
When other permits are obtained in conjunction with a building permit, such fees shall be waived.
This does not alleviate the responsibility of subcontractors to obtain permits for the work they are
doing.
6. Investigation Fees : Work without a permit.
a. Investigation: Whenever any work for which a permit is required by these regulations has been
commenced without first obtaining said permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit

DIVISION 3. INSPECTIONS
Section 13. Inspections.
1. General . All work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the building official
and all such work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the
building official. In addition, certain types of construction shall have continuous inspections as
specified in Article III, Division 3, Section 13(9).
Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the
provisions of these regulations or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to
give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of these regulations or of other ordinances of the
jurisdiction shall not be valid.
It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for
inspection purposes. Neither the building official nor this jurisdiction shall be liable for expense
entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to allow inspection.
A survey of the lot may be required by the building official to verify that the structure is located in
accordance with the approved plans.
2. Inspection record card . Work requiring a permit shall not be commenced until the permit holder or his
agent shall have posted or otherwise made available an inspection record card such as to allow the
building official conveniently to make the required entries thereon regarding inspection of the work.
This card shall be maintained available by the permit holder until final approval has been granted by
the building official.

4. Approval required . Work shall not be done beyond the point indicated in each successive inspection
without first obtaining the approval of the building official. The building official, upon notification, shall
make the requested inspections and shall either indicate that portion of the construction is
satisfactory as completed, or shall notify the permit holder or his agent wherein the same fails to
comply with these regulations. Any portions which do not comply shall be corrected and such portion
shall not be covered or concealed until authorized by the building official.
There shall be a final inspection and approval of all buildings and structures when completed and
ready for occupancy and use.
5. Required Inspections : Reinforcing steel or structural framework of any part of any building or
structure shall not be covered or concealed without first obtaining the approval of the Building
Official.
The Building Official, upon notification, shall make the following inspections and shall either approve
that portion of the construction as completed or shall notify the permit holder or his agent wherein the
same fails to comply with these regulations.
a. Layout Inspection : When the building and all property lines are staked out and prior to any
excavation. If original property pins are not located, then a survey must be made. On any new
construction, which will be built within one foot (1') of a required setback, utility easement or property
line, the builder or owner must furnish the Building Official an "as-built survey", by a licensed
surveyor, upon completion of the foundation work. Such survey must show the structure complies
with the required setbacks, before any framing work is authorized. Should such a survey indicate a
zoning violation or projection into a utility easement, a stop-work order shall be issued immediately.
b. Foundation Inspection : To be made after excavations for footings are complete and any required
reinforcing steel is in place. For concrete foundations, any required forms shall be in place prior to
inspection. All materials for the foundation shall be on the job, except where concrete is ready-mixed
in accordance with UBC Standard No. 26-13, the concrete need not be on the job. Where the
foundation is to be constructed of approved treated wood, additional inspections may be required by
the Building Official.
c. Concrete Slab Or Under-Floor Inspection : To be made after all in-slab or under-floor building
service equipment, conduit, piping accessories and other ancillary equipment items are in place but
before any concrete is placed or floor sheathing installed, including the subfloor.
d. Frame Inspection : To be made after the roof, all framing, fire blocking and bracing are in place
and all pipes, chimneys and vents are complete and the rough electrical, plumbing, and heating,
wires, pipes, and ducts are approved.
e. Lath And/Or Wallboard Inspection : To be made after all lathing and wallboard, interior and
exterior, is in place but before any plastering is applied or before wallboard joints and fasteners are
taped and finished.
f. Final Inspection : To be made after finish grading and the building is completed and ready for
occupancy.
6. Required Building Service Equipment Inspections :
a. General : All building service equipment for which a permit is required by these regulations shall
be inspected by the Building Official. No portion of any building service equipment intended to be
concealed by any permanent portion of the building shall be concealed until inspected and approved.
When the installation of any building service equipment is complete, an additional and final
inspection shall be made. Building service equipment regulated by the technical codes shall not be
1/15/2020 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/KS/Emporia/index.htm 480/510
connected to the water, fuel or power supply, or sewer system until authorized by the Building
Official.
b. Operation Of Building Service Equipment : The requirements of this Section shall not be
considered to prohibit the operation of any building service equipment installed to replace existing
building service equipment serving an occupied portion of the building in the event a request for
inspection of such building service equipment has been filed with the Building Official not more than
forty eight (48) hours after such replacement work is completed, and before any portion of such
building service equipment is concealed by any permanent portion of the building.
7. Other Inspections :
a. In addition to the called inspections specified above, the Building Official may make, or the
technical codes may require, other inspections of any construction work to ascertain compliance with
the provisions of these regulations or technical codes and other laws which are enforced by the code
enforcement agency.
b. After demolition is complete and prior to vacating the job site, an inspection shall be called for the
Building Official.
8. Reinspections : A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such
portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete, or when corrections called for are not
made.
This subsection 8 is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected
for failure to comply with the requirements of the technical codes, but as controlling the practice of
calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection.
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the permit card is not properly posted on the work site, the
approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for
which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the Building
Official.
To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefore in writing upon a form
furnished for that purpose, and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with Table 8(A) of this Article,
as set forth in the fee schedule adopted by this jurisdiction.
In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will
be performed until the required fees have been paid.
9. Special Inspections : As required by the current edition of the Uniform Building Code. (Ord. 89-9, 4-5-
1989; Ord. 98-26, § 6, 10-7-1998)
Section 14. Supervision And Responsibility:

2. Temporary connections . The building official may authorize the temporary connection of the building
service equipment to the source of energy, fuel or power for the purpose of testing building service
equipment, or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy.
Section 16. Certificate of occupancy.
1. Use or Occupancy . No building or structure shall be used or occupied and no change in the existing
occupancy classification of a building or structure or portion thereof shall be made until the building
official has issued a certificate of occupancy therefore as provided therein.
Exception : Group R, Division 3, and M occupancies.
Issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not be construed as an approval of a violation of the
provisions of these regulations or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Certificates presuming to
give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of these regulations or of other ordinances of the
jurisdiction shall not be valid.
2. Change in use . Changes in the character or use of a building shall not be made except as specified
in the building code and zoning regulations.
3. Certificate issued . After the building official inspects the building or structure and finds no violations of
the provisions of these regulations or other laws which are enforced by the code enforcement
agency, the building official shall issue a certificate of occupancy which shall contain the following:
a. The building permit number.
b. The address of the building.
c. The name of the building contractor, subcontractors, and architect if applicable.
d. A description of that portion of the building for which the certificate is issued.

of any building or portion thereof before the same is completed, he may issue a temporary certificate
of occupancy for the use of a portion or portions of a building or structure prior to the completion of
the entire building or structure.
5. Posting . The certificate of occupancy shall be affixed to the electrical panel and shall not be removed
except by the building official.
6. Revocation . The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a certificate of occupancy issued
under the provisions of these regulations whenever the certificate is issued in error, or on the basis of
incorrect information supplied, or when it is determined that the building or structure or portion
thereof is in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of these regulations.

a. Subdivision Regulations are the process through which raw land is converted
into buildable sites for residential, commercial and industrial uses. The physical
arrangement of these lots along with provisions for streets, alleys, utilities,
schools, parks and other community facilities will in a large part determine the
quality of life in the community and, therefore, is of public interest. Such
regulations establish standards that insure that the growth of urban areas will
reflect sound planning and will not be detrimental to the community.
b. These regulations are designed, intended and adopted for the following

Emporia and the surrounding Metropolitan Planning Area.

and re-subdivisions.

other conditions justify a variation from the right angle intersection, the minimum
angle shall be sixty (60) degrees.
g. Streets Adjacent to a Railroad Right-of-Way, Limited Access Freeway,
Principal Highway or Arterial Streets. Where lots front or side, but do not back on
railroad rights-of-way, limited access freeways, principal highways, or arterial
streets a marginal access street or frontage road may be required parallel and
adjacent to the boundary of such rights-of-way. The distance from said rights-ofway
shall be determined with due consideration to minimum distance required for
approach connections to future grade-separated intersections.

b. Minimum lot depth shall be one hundred and ten (110) feet, measured through
the center of the lot and perpendicular to the property line, or radial to the
property line or curved streets.
c. Maximum depth of residential lots shall not exceed two and one-half (2-1/2)
times the width of the lot.
d. If the proposed subdivision is to be served with City water and City sewer or a
community-type sewage treatment plant, approval of the plat shall be subject to
the minimum requirements set forth in these regulations and the zoning
regulations of the district in which the subdivision is located.
e. If the proposed subdivision is to be served with a public water supply, but not
with a public sanitary sewer system, the preliminary plat will be submitted on the
basis of the minimum of three (3) acre lots and will be subject to the approval of
the County Health Department, who shall make or cause to be made soil
analysis and percolation tests for each lot and make recommendations to the
Planning Commission. The plat lots will be so proportioned as to permit future
re-platting consistent with good subdivision design.
f. If the proposed subdivision is served with a public sanitary sewer system and
not with a public water supply, and the developer will use a private water supply,
the preliminary plat will be submitted on the basis of a minimum of one (1) acre
lots, subject to the approval of the County Health Department, and be so
proportioned that future platting will be consistent with good subdivision design.
g. If the proposed subdivision is not served with either an approved public water
supply or an approved public sanitary sewer system and the developer will be
using a private water supply with an approved private sewage disposal system,
the subdivider shall submit his or her preliminary plat on the basis of ten (10)
acre lots, subject to the approval of the County Health Department, which shall
secure soil analysis and percolation tests and submit a recommendation to the
Planning Commission. The lots will be so proportioned as to permit future replatting
consistent with good subdivision design.
h. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum area requirements of the
zoning regulations with no lot in a residential district being less than fifty (50) feet
in width at the building setback line. Flag lots shall make provisions for no less
than fifteen (15) feet of street frontage. Non-residential lots shall provide
adequate depth and width to provide for the type of use contemplated.
i. Minimum lot area shall be subject to the zoning regulations of the district in
which the subdivision is located.
j. All side lot lines shall bear sixty (60) to ninety (90) degrees from the street rightof-
way line on a straight street or from the tangent of a curved street.
k. Front building or setback lines shall be shown on the final plat for all lots in the
subdivision and shall not be less than the setbacks required by the zoning
regulations or any other resolution adopted by the Governing Body. The greater
setback requirement shall govern.
l. Double frontage lots shall be avoided unless, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, a variation to this prohibition will give better street alignment and lot
arrangement.
m. Every lot shall have frontage on a public street other than an alley.
n. The subdivision or re-subdivision of a tract or lot shall not be permitted where
said subdivision or re-subdivision places an existing permanent structure in
violation of the requirements of the zoning regulations or the minimum design
standards of these regulations.
o. Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one (1) or more acres and
there are indications that such lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller
lots, consideration must be given to the highway, street and lot arrangement of
the original subdivision so that additional minor streets can be opened which will
permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots. Easements providing for the future
opening and extension of such streets may, at the discretion of the Planning
Commission, be made a requirement of the plat.
p. Whenever possible, residential lots shall not face on arterial streets. The
number of lots facing on collector streets shall be kept to a minimum in each
subdivision. The street pattern shall be designed so that the side line of lots abut
collector streets wherever land shapes and topography permit.
SECTION 4-5 EASEMENTS
4-501. a. Where alleys are not provided, permanent easements of not less than
seven and one-half (7-1/2) feet in width shall be provided on each side of all rear
lot lines, and on side lot lines, where necessary, for utility poles, wires, conduits,
storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains, and other public utilities.
Where a utility company or other service provider can demonstrate the need for a
wider easement than required above for a specific location, such may be
required by the Governing Body and provided by the developer. These
easements shall provide for a continuous right-of-way at least fifteen (15) feet in
width. An additional six (6) foot wide temporary construction easement abutting
each side of a utility easement shall be provided for initial construction of water,
sewer and other utility lines.
b. All easements shall be shown on the plat. Permanent easements shall not be
obstructed by structures or vegetation. A property owner may erect fences and
landscape the easement at his or her own risk of loss.
c. Drainage Easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage
way or channel, then a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way shall be
provided. Such easement or right-of-way shall conform substantially to the lines
of the natural watercourse and shall be of such width or construction, or both, as
may be necessary to provide adequate storm water drainage and for access for
maintenance thereof. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection
therewith. The engineer having jurisdiction shall make a study and report his or
her recommendation to the Planning Commission as to the desired width of such
easement. Such study and report shall be based on the one hundred year flood
depth (if known). Maintenance of storm water easements and drainage right-ofway
shall be the responsibility of the owners of property adjoining such
easements or right-of-way.
SECTION 4-6 DESIGN TECHNIQUES
4-601. The appendix contains illustrations which may be used as guides in the
review of subdivision applications.
4-602. Subdivision Design: The design of the subdivision shall provide for
efficient traffic flow, proper mixing of land uses, and a logical link between
surrounding, existing development, and the proposed layout. The
Comprehensive Plan should be used as a guide in determining if the design of
the proposed subdivision is proper. The Planning Commission shall have the
authority to deny a plat or request redesign, if, in its opinion, the layout is not
suitable for the site, or if the development of the subdivision would be premature.
SECTION 4-7 ACCESS CONTROL
4-701. In the interest of public safety and for the preservation of the traffic
carrying capacity of the street system, the Planning Commission shall have the
right to regulate points of access to all property from the public streets system.
Such proscriptions shall be indicated on the final plat.
SECTION 4-8 SOLAR ACCESS
4-801. a. In order to promote the conservation of energy through the use of both
passive and active solar systems, it is suggested that streets in residential
subdivision should have an east-west alignment. Lots intended for detached
dwellings should be of sufficient width to allow the structure to be built with its
longest axis running east-west.
b. Any subdivider may grant or establish a solar skyspace easement to protect
solar energy systems from being shaded. The easements shall be created in
writing and shall be recorded on the face of the plat. The easements shall run
with the land.
DEDICATION OR RESERVATION OF PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN
SPACE
SECTION 5-1 DEDICATION OR RESERVATION OF PUBLIC SITES AND
OPEN SPACES
SECTION 5-1 DEDICATION OR RESERVATION OF PUBLIC SITES AND
OPEN SPACES
5-101. In subdividing land or re-subdividing an existing plat, due consideration
should be given by the subdivider to the dedication or reservation of suitable
sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, or other public recreational areas or open
spaces. In its consideration of any such subdividing or resubdividing of the
Planning Commission shall make recommendations as to dedications and
reservations. Any area so dedicated or reserved shall conform as nearly as
possible to the recommendations of the Planning Commission and the Board of
Education. All areas to be reserved for, or dedicated to, public use shall be
indicated on the preliminary plat in order that it may be determined when and in
what manner such areas will be dedicated to or acquired. A written statement
from the Board of Education shall be submitted by the subdivider, along with the
preliminary plat, indicating whether or not a school site in the proposed
subdivision is desired.
SECTION 5-2 ACTION BY GOVERNING BODY
SECTION 5-2 ACTION BY GOVERNING BODY
5-201. Upon receiving the recommendations of the Planning Commission, the
Governing Body may:
a. Accept such dedication.
b. Accept, in lieu of the dedication of land, a fee equal to seven (7) percent of
the fair market value of the subdivided land.
c. Waive the requirement if the Governing Body finds that there are sufficient
schools, parks, playgrounds or other publicly-owned or operated
recreational areas or open spaces in the area of the subdivision.
SECTION 5-3 USE OF LAND AND FEES
SECTION 5-3 USE OF LAND AND FEES
5-301. Land or fees obtained pursuant to this Article shall only be used to obtain
public open space, public recreational land or facilities for public use. The
Governing Body shall make appropriate findings as to the relationship between
the subdivision from which the fees were obtained and such open space,
recreational land or facilities for public use
SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF PLATS

any subsequent owner(s) of lots within the proposed
subdivision agree:
a. To make connection to the city sewage system
whenever such public sewer is extended within
500 feet of any boundary of the subdivision
and the City makes a request that such
connection be made, and further;
b. To pay the cost of such extension of the public
sewer to the subdivision and the cost of
connection of lots thereto, whether by means
of special assessment, connection fees and /
or another lawful means.

recommendations to the Planning Commission.
c. Approval or Disapproval of Preliminary Plat. Action by the Planning
Commission shall be conveyed to the subdivider in writing within ten (10)
business days after the Planning Commission meeting, at which time the
plat was considered and action was taken thereon. Approval of the
preliminary plat by the Planning Commission does not constitute an
acceptance of the subdivision, but is rather merely an authorization for the
subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plat. In cases where
the plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall be notified of the reason for
such action and what requirements shall be necessary to meet the
approval of the Planning Commission. If the Planning Commission fails to
approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within sixty (60) days after the
plat has been submitted for consideration, then such preliminary plat shall
be deemed to have been approved, unless the subdivider shall have
consented to extend or waive such time limitation.
d. Area to be Platted. In order to ensure that the provisions of these
regulations are carried out and that the overall subdivision design is
prepared in an orderly manner, the Planning Commission may require that
a preliminary plat be submitted on all contiguous land under common
ownership rather than a parcel or segment. The area may, however, be
final platted in smaller parcels or segments as directed by the Planning
Commission.
e. Effective Date. The approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for
an indefinite period of time, except that the Planning Commission may,
after a minimum period of six (6) months due to substantial justification or
change in the area, require the redesign and resubmission of the
preliminary plat.
SECTION 6-4 FINAL PLAT

preliminary plat shall be during the consideration of the final plat.
4. The final plat, prepared for recording purposes, shall be drawn at a
scale of 1" = 100' or larger (i.e. 1"=50, not 1" =200'). The size of
the sheet on which such final plat is prepared shall be twenty-four
(24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches. Each sheet shall have a one
and one-half inch (1-1/2") binding edge along the left hand side.

Governing Body (a) waive any requirement of guarantee of installation or (b)
accept one of the following methods of guarantee provided it is in accordance
with the policies of the Governing Body.
a. Fiscal sureties may be offered subject to the following:
1. The subdivider shall enter into a subdivider's agreement with the
Governing Body under which the subdivider agrees to install such required
improvements. Such agreement shall be conditioned upon the
acceptances of the final plat by the Governing Body and its filing with the
Lyon County Register of Deeds.
2. Simultaneously with the execution of the subdivider's agreement, the
subdivider shall furnish a corporate completion bond by a firm authorized
to do business in Kansas with good and sufficient sureties thereon or a
cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of
the Governing Body, in the amount of the estimated cost as approved by
the official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and
construction standards of the installation of the required improvements.
Such financial guarantee shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the
final plat and further conditioned upon the actual completion and
satisfactory installation of such required improvements within two years
from the date that the final plat is accepted by the Governing Body.
3. Simultaneously with the execution of the subdivider's agreement, if the
subdivider furnishes a corporate completion bond, he or shall also deposit
in escrow an amount equal to the cost of all improvements to be made in
accordance with the plans and specifications for required improvements or
an equivalent amount in the form of a maintenance bond or other
securities that may be deemed sufficient by the Governing Body. If a
subdivider furnishes a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable
letter of credit, 15% of the amount of such guarantees shall be returned
by, or held as a deposit in escrow after the final completion of such
improvements. The subdivider shall agree that the deposit in escrow may
be held by the Governing Body for a period of 18 months after such
improvements are completed for the purpose of:
(a) Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in
material or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in
character, and not discernible at the time of final inspection or
acceptance by the Governing Body; and
(b) Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by
reason of the settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof.
Such escrow agreement shall provide that, as such defects have so
developed, that the deposit may be applied by the Governing Body
for any amounts incurred correcting such defects; and that the
balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of such 18-month
period shall be returned by the Governing Body to the depositor, or
paid to the order of the depositor without payment of interest.
b. Petitions to the Governing Body may be submitted as a means of
guaranteeing the authority to install improvements at such time as the Governing
Body deems appropriate. Petitions may be submitted only when the following
conditions exist:
1. The petitions must be brought in the manner set out under Kansas law.
2. The petitions must be approved by the applicable Governing Body
concurrently with the acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the
applicable Governing Body concurrently with the petition approval or as
soon thereafter as may be provided by law.
4. A certificate signed by the petitioner must be recorded with the Lyon
County Register of Deeds stating that such petitions have been filed and
approved by the applicable Governing Body and that certain land within
the plat as described will be liable in the future for special assessment for
the required improvements authorized.
c. For streets and related drainage for subdivisions located in unincorporated
areas, preconstruction of improvements as an alternative method of
guaranteeing their installation may be used if approved by the County Governing
Body. In this event, the subdivider may request the Governing Body to hold the
final plat acceptance until such time as an inspection certifies that the required
improvements have been properly constructed. Such a preconstruction
procedure shall be temporarily conditioned on subsequent acceptance of the final
plat and a time limit for actual construction mutually agreed upon. Maintenance
guarantees may also be required by the Governing Body.
d. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter
from the utility provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have
been made by the subdivider guaranteeing the installation of their respective
services.
e. Monuments and benchmarks shall be installed in accordance with the
requirements of these regulations and their installation certified by a licensed
land surveyor on the final plat before such plat is recorded with the Lyon County
Register of Deeds.
SECTION 9-2 OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS

these regulations is impractical or impossible due to the size, shape, topographic
location or condition, or such usage of land included in a subdivision plat being
presented for approval, the Planning Commission may recommend variances or
exceptions of these regulations in the final plat. Such recommendation shall
intend that substantial justice may be done and the public interest be secured.
Such Planning Commission recommendation for authorization of variances or
exceptions shall be made by letter of transmittal to the Governing Body. In
recommending such variances or exceptions, the Planning Commission must
find:
1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the
property;
2. That the variances or exceptions are necessary for the reasonable and

The intent of this district is to provide for the confinement of adult entertainment
establishments to those commercial and industrial zoning districts in which the

9. The need for the telecom structure to provide or enhance personal wireless
telecommunication services in the area, including: a map showing the location of the
proposed telecom structure and its service area; the location of the providers other
existing telecom structures in the area; applicable propagation models, search ring
maps and other relevant documentation.
a. The minimum height required to serve the proposed service area.
b. An explanation why the proposed site is required to meet service demands and
how it would interact with the providers other existing telecom structures in
the service area.
c. Proposed stealth measures designed to minimize potentially adverse visual
effects on nearby properties, with consideration of design, unobtrusiveness,
minimum height necessary to accommodate antennae, avoidance of artificial
light and the color of the telecom structure.
d. A description of the fall zone of the telecom structure.
e. The distance between the proposed telecom structure and the nearest
residential dwelling unit and residentially zoned properties.
f. A description of the security barrier, if any, surrounding the base of the
telecom structure, including the method of fencing, finished color and, if
applicable, the method of camouflage and illumination.
g. Applicants shall be required to submit information on the proposed power
density of their proposed telecom structure and demonstrate compliance with
FCC standards regulating radio frequency (RF) emissions. This information
is used solely for public information, as the FCC has the sole jurisdiction to
regulate RF emissions. The City will not condition or deny an application
because of potential RF impacts.
h. When applicable, documentation that the proposed tower or stealth monopole
meets FAA requirements.
i. Any other information requested by the City that is reasonably necessary for
the City to fully evaluate the application.
20-812. Abandonment of Tower.
a. In the event the use of any tower has been discontinued for a period of one (1) year, or in
the event that a permittee has taken no action within one-hundred eighty (180) days after the
revocation of a tower permit, such tower shall be deemed abandoned.
20-12
b. The Governing Body shall provide the tower owner with three (3) months notice and an
opportunity to be heard by the Governing Body for the purpose, before initiating an
abandonment action.
20-813. Stealth Design Principles for Telecommunication Structures
Stealth telecom structures shall be designed to blend in with the character and environment of the
area in which they are proposed to be located, and to enhance compatibility with nearby land
uses by minimizing visual impacts. Pre-Existing telecom devices that are modified or
replacement shall incorporate the following design principles, as applicable to the type of
telecom structure and character of the location:
A. Preserve the pre-existing character of the area as much as possible.
B. Minimize the height, mass and proportion of telecom structures to minimize impacts on the
character of the nearby area.
C. Minimize the silhouette presented by new towers, stealth monopoles, antenna support
structures and antenna arrays. Monopoles are favored over lattice-type towers; antennas
mounted inside an antenna support structure or monopole, or mounted flush to the antenna
support structure, are favored over triangular top-hat or other projecting external types of
antenna arrays.
D. Use colors, textures and materials that blend in with the existing environment; surfaces shall
be painted, or otherwise treated, to match or complement existing background structures and
surfaces, and to minimize reflection.
E. Conceal telecommunication facilities from view by placing inside a building, steeple,
penthouse, clock tower, flagpole or other appropriate structure. Architectural additions or
appurtenances to existing antenna support structures that are intended to conceal
telecommunication facilities, shall be designed to be appropriate in mass, scale, material,
texture, color and character with the existing antenna support structure.
F. Camouflage and/or disguise telecom structures to look like another type of structure or
object, through methods including, but not limited to design, placement, use of materials,
texture, color, year-round landscaping and screening, to blend in with the character of the
surroundings, or integrate into the architectural elements and character of an existing antenna
support structure to such an extent that it is indistinguishable by the casual observer from the
structure on which it is located, or from the surroundings in which it is placed. Stealth
monopoles designed to look like a flagpole shall utilize a flag that is appropriately sized for
the height of the pole. Stealth monopoles disguised as a tree shall be of a height, character
and placement that is appropriate to the location. Telecom structures mounted on roofs or
similar structures shall be concealed from view by placement and setback from the edges
and/or through use of architectural screening that is in character with the building or antenna
support structure.
G. Locate telecom structures in areas where trees and/or buildings obscure some or all the
20-13
telecom structures from view, and install new year-round landscaping and screening around
the site where visible from public streets or residential areas.
H. Locate accessory equipment inside a building or in underground vaults when possible.
Screen ground-level telecom structures through use of walls, fencing or year-round
landscaping, or combinations thereof, which is appropriate in design, height and material to
the character of the location and the structure to be screened.

SECTION 20-12 RESIDENTIAL-DESIGN MANUFACTURED HOUSING STANDARDS
20-1201. a. In order to be classified as a Residential-Design Manufactured Home a structure
must be manufactured to the standards embodied in the National Manufactured Home
Construction and Safety Standards generally know as the HUD Code established in 1976
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5403. Such structures shall provide all of the accommodations
necessary to be a dwelling unit and shall be connected to all utilities in conformance with
applicable City regulations. Such a structure shall be on a permanent-type, enclosed perimeter
foundation which has minimum dimensions of 22 body feet in width excluding bay windows,
garages, porches, patios, pop-outs and roof overhangs; a pitched roof; siding and roofing
materials which are customarily used on site-built homes; and which complies with the following
architectural or aesthetic standards so as to ensure their compatibility with site-built housing:
1. The roof must be predominantly double-pitched and have a minimum vertical rise
of 2.5 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal run, and must be covered with
material that is customarily used on site-built dwellings, including but not limited
to approved wood, asphalt composition shingles, clay or concrete title, slate or
fiberglass, but excluding corrugated aluminum or corrugated fiberglass roof. The
roof shall have a minimum eave projection and roof overhang on at least two
sides of 10 inches which may include a gutter.
2. Exterior siding shall be of a nonreflective material customarily used on site-built
dwellings such as wood, composition, simulated wood, clapboards, conventional
vinyl or metal siding, brick, stucco, or similar materials, but excluding smooth
ribbed or corrugated metal or plastic panels. Siding material shall extend below
the top of the exterior of the foundation or curtain wall or the joint between siding
and enclosure wall shall be flashed in accordance with City-adopted building
codes.
3. The home shall be installed in accordance with the recommended installation
procedure of the manufacturer and the Uniform Building Code as adopted by the
20-19
City. The running gear, tongue, axles and wheels shall be removed from the unit
at the time of installation. Either a basement or a continuous, permanent masonry
foundation or curtain wall, unpierced except for required ventilation and access
which may include walk-out basements and garages, shall be installed under the
perimeter of the home.
4. At the main entrance door there shall be a landing that is a minimum of 25 square
feet which is constructed to meet the requirements of City-adopted building
codes.
5. The moving hitch, axles, wheels and transporting lights must be removed at the
time of installation of the home on the lot.
6. On level sites, the main floor shall be no greater than twenty four (24) inches
above the finished grade at the foundation. On sloping or irregular sites, the main
floor at the side closest to grade level shall not be greater than twenty-four (24)
inches above the finished grade at the foundation.
7. Stairs, porches, entrance platforms, ramps and other means of entrance and exit to
and from the home shall be installed or constructed in accordance with the
standards set by the Uniform Building Code as adopted by the City and attached
permanently to the primary structure and anchored permanently to the ground.
8. Any attached addition to such a home shall comply with all construction
requirements of the City-adopted building codes, unless designed and constructed
by a manufactured home factory.
9. If 50% or more of the frontage of existing site-built housing on both sides of the
street on which the residential-design manufactured home is to be installed have a
garage and/or a similar percentage have a covered porch or recessed entry, such a
home shall also provide a garage and/or porch or entry based on the percentages
determined by the Zoning Administrator. On a corner lot, street shall mean that
street on which the frontage of the facade has been designated for the household
address number. External roofing and siding material of such garage, porch or
entry shall be similar in appearance to the materials on the roofing and siding of
the residential-design manufactured home.
b. For purposes of these regulations, the term "manufactured home", when used by itself,
shall not include a "residential-design manufactured home" as herein defined.
SECTION 20-13 LANDSCAPING
20-1301. Landscaping.
a. The intent of this section is as follows: to provide greenery to visually soften paved
areas and buildings; to establish optimum environmental conditions by providing shade, air
20-20
purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, retardation of storm water runoff, and
abatement of noise, glare and heat; to preserve existing trees; and to buffer uncomplimentary
land uses and generally enhance the quality and appearance of developed properties.
b. Landscaping shall be provided when a building permit is issued on all properties
developed for multiple-family use and all nonresidential uses when such uses are established on
property one-half (1/2) acre or greater in area.
1. Landscaping shall be provided along a front lot line to the depth of at least 10 feet
whenever such front lot line is adjacent to or across from residential districts. No
other uses except driveways and signs shall be allowed in such landscaped area.
2. All landscaping shall meet the requirements of the sight triangle in Section 20-4.
3. Landscaping along the front lot line shall involve bringing the soil surface to a
smooth finished grade and installing sufficient trees, shrubs, ground cover and
grass to soften building lines, provide shade and generally produce a pleasing
visual effect of the premises.
4. Minimum tree requirements: Insofar as practicable, the existing landscape should
be preserved, minimizing tree and vegetation removal. Landscaping should be
used on the site to visually screen storage areas, truck loading areas, utility
buildings, and structures; enhance architectural features; block noise generated by
intense-use areas; generally shade and cool the area; and direct the wind
movements.
5. Whenever such landscaping is required, a landscape plan for the area shall
accompany the application for a building permit. Such plan shall be reviewed by
the Zoning Administrator for compliance with these regulations prior to the
issuance of building permits.
6. The landscaping plan shall be in such detail to provide enough information to
determine if the plan meets the above criteria. Such plan is to include the
following information:
(a) North point and scale.
(b) Topographic information and final grading adequate to identify and
properly specify planting for areas needing slope protection.
(c) The location, size and surface of materials of all structures and parking
areas.
(d) The location, size and type of all above-ground and underground utilities
and structures with proper notation, as to any safety hazards to avoid
during installation of landscaping.
20-21
(e) The location, size, type and quantity of all proposed landscaping materials,
along with common and botanical names of all plant species. The size,
grading and condition shall be specified according to American
Association of Nurserymen Standards.
(f) The location, size and common name of all existing plant materials to be
retained on the site.
(g) Mature sizes of plant materials shall be drawn to scale and identified on
the plan.
(h) Location of hose connections and other watering sources.
(i) The location of all trees, 12-inch caliper or larger, measured at 4 feet
above ground level, that are proposed for removal.
7. The Zoning Administrator may, in his or her discretion, temporarily or
permanently waive any of the requirements of 20-1301.b for landscaping if:
(a) The adjacent land may not necessitate nor benefit from such a
requirement; or
(b) The adjacent land use may already have adequate landscaping for which
additional landscaping may be a duplication; or
(c) The future land use for the adjacent area can not readily be determined at
the time of the application for building permit and that the requirements
should be waived and the matter reviewed at a specified date in the future.
In such case, the Zoning Administrator shall require that either a letter of
assurance or a covenant be submitted to run with the land; or a guarantee
in the form of a corporate security bond, cashiers check, escrow account or
other security be submitted to the City to ensure that such requirements
will be met when a determination is made.
8. Maintenance.
(a) It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain in
good condition all of the required landscaping improvements.
When it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that
improvements required by this section are not being maintained, he
or she shall give notice in writing to the property owner. Such
notice shall specify in what manner the improvements are in need
of maintenance and a date for compliance. The owner shall not
have less than 30 days to comply with the notice.
20-22
(b) If the owner of the land has failed, refused or neglected to make
the necessary maintenance repairs within the time of the notice
such failure, refusal or neglect may be (1) prosecuted as a violation
of these regulations, or (2) the Zoning Administrator shall cause
such maintenance to be done to the property. The cost of
maintenance shall be certified by the Zoning Administrator to the
Clerk, who shall cause the costs to be assessed against the property
on which the maintenance repairs were made.
SECTION 20-14 INOPERABLE MOTOR VEHICLES
20-1401. Inoperable motor vehicles shall be permitted only in the following locations or under
the following conditions:
a. Within a completely enclosed building in a residential district when the vehicle is
owned by the resident residing on such premises; except that when the resident is engaged as a
hobby in the restoration of not more than one inoperable motor vehicle more than thirty-five (35)
years old, the vehicle need not be enclosed in a building.
b. Within a salvage yard
c. Within a motor vehicle storage yard.
d. At a motor vehicle body or repair service in accordance with the restrictions of the
district in which said use is located.
SECTION 20-15 EMERGENCY ACCESS ROADS
20-1501. a. Wherever regulations of the City or County require means of access to property by
emergency response vehicles, including fire, police and ambulance, and no such access is
available by means of public street or road, the Zoning Administrator may, upon request of the
property owner, issue a permit for an emergency access road which shall not be dedicated and
opened as a public street
b. Such a permit shall state the conditions upon use of the road, including but not
limited to the following:
1. Prohibition upon use of the road for any purpose other than for access by
emergency response vehicles;
2. Prohibition against parking any vehicle upon the roadway or otherwise
obstructing in any way the road;
3. Requiring the owner to maintain the road; and
4. Requiring the owner to post and maintain signs declaring the road to be restricted
20-23
to use by emergency response vehicles only.
c. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to suspend or revoke any permit upon a
finding of a violation of any condition of the permit.
d. A decision of the Zoning Administrator not to issue a permit, or to suspend or
revoke a permit, may be appealed by any aggrieved party to the Board of Zoning Appeals.

Exceptions as Conforming Uses
SECTION 21-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
21-101. Nonconformities are of three types: nonconforming lots of record,
nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses, each type defined as follows.
a. Nonconforming lots of record: Means an unimproved lot which is part of
a recorded subdivision or a parcel of land, the deed to which was recorded with
the Lyon County Register of Deeds prior to the original adoption of zoning
regulations and neither said lot nor parcel complies with the lot width or area
requirements for any permitted use in the district in which it is located.
b. Nonconforming structure: Means an existing structure which does not
comply with the lot coverage, height or yard requirements which are applicable to
new structures in the zoning district in which it is located.
c. Nonconforming use: Means an existing use of a structure or land which
does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning
district in which it is located.
SECTION 21-2 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
21-201. The zoning administrator may issue a zoning certificate for any
nonconforming lot of record, provided that:
a. Said lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned
separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the
creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been
prohibited by any zoning regulations, and
b. Said lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from
adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of
such lot has been prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations, and
c. Said lot can meet all yard regulations for the district in which it is located,
and
d. Said lot can meet minimum standards for sewage treatment as required
by the county sanitation code.
SECTION 21-3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
21-301. a. Authority to continue. Any structure that is devoted to a use
which is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located
on a lot which does not comply with the applicable intensity of use regulations
and/or the applicable yard and height regulations, may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful.
b. Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any nonconforming principal structure
may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled; provided, however, that no
such enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create any
additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all
or any part of such structure. Notwithstanding the above, a porch which is
covered by a roof which extends into a front setback area may be enclosed but
not in excess of the area covered by the existing roof.
c. Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming structure is
damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty (50)
percent of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located or
unless such restoration is authorized as an exception by the board of zoning
appeals in conformance with Article 20. When a structure is damaged to the
extent of fifty (50) percent or less of its fair market value, no repairs or restoration
shall be made unless a zoning certificate is obtained and substantial restoration
is underway within one year after the date of such partial destruction and repair
or restoration is diligently pursued to completion.
d. Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part
for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same lot or any other lot
unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being moved.
e. Damage or destruction of multiple family structures. If greater than 50%
damaged, multiple family structures built under previous intensity requirements
may be reconstructed at the same intensity as the original construction, in the
event of a hardship not created by the owner, with the stipulation the structure is
rebuilt within 18 months from the damage date with an extension being allowed
under extenuating circumstances.
SECTION 21-4 NONCONFORMING USES
21-401. a. Authority to continue. Any nonconforming use of part or all of a
structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land which was lawful and
in existence at the effective date of these regulations and does not involve a
structure or only involves a structure which is accessory to such use of land, may
be continued, so long as otherwise lawful and so long as it is not specified to be
terminated by these regulations.
b. Ordinary repair and maintenance.
1. Normal maintenance and incidental repair, or replacement,
installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is
devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance
with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public
safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its
restoration to a safe condition.
c. Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded,
enlarged, or in-creased in intensity. Such prohibited activities shall include,
without being limited to, the following:
1. Extension of such use to any structure or land area other than that
occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these
regulations or on the effective date of subsequent amendments to these
regulations that cause such use to become nonconforming.
2. Extension of such use within a building or other structure to any
portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use
on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of
subsequent amendments to these regulations that cause such use to
become nonconforming; provided, however, that such use may be extended
throughout any part of such building or other structure that is found
by the zoning administrator to have been lawfully and manifestly designed
or constructed for such use on such effective date.
d. Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such
structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
e. Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted in
whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means,
to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value, such structure
shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located or unless
such restoration is authorized as an exception by the board of zoning appeals in
conformance with Article 25. When such damage or destruction is fifty (50)
percent or less of fair market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made
unless a zoning certificate is obtained, and substantial restoration is underway
within one year after the date of such partial destruction and repair or restoration
is diligently pursued to completion.
f. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and no nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole
or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any
other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof or the use of land shall
thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located
after being so moved. Manufactured housing may be replaced on an existing
pad having utility hook-ups if such pad has not been vacant for the previous
ninety (90) consecutive days.
g. Change in use. Unless structural alterations are made which will expand
the area or change the dimensions of the existing structure, any nonconforming
use of a structure, or nonconforming structure and premises, may change to
another nonconforming use provided that the board of zoning appeals either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed nonconforming use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the
board of zoning appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards to
protect surrounding areas and the public welfare, in accordance with Article 25.
Once such use has changed, it may no longer be returned to the original use or
any other less appropriate use.
h. Abandonment or discontinuance. When a nonconforming use is
discontinued or abandoned for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, such
use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or
occupancy of such land or buildings shall comply with the regulations of the
zoning district in which such land is located.
i. Nonconforming accessory uses. No nonconforming use which is
accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal
use shall cease or terminate,
j. Nonconforming residential uses. Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsections c and d of this section, any structure which is devoted to a
residential use and which is located in a commercial or industrial district, may be
remodeled, extended, expanded, and enlarged; provided that after any such
remodeling, extension, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be
used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such
structure accommodated prior to the undertaking of any such work.
SECTION 21-5 EXCEPTIONS AS CONFORMING USES
21-501. a. Status of existing exceptions. Where a use exists at the time of
the effective date of these regulations and is permitted by these regulations only
as an exception in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall not be
deemed to be a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed
a lawful conforming use in such zoning district. However, such use shall not
expand or enlarge until application is made to and approved by the board of
zoning appeals as set out in Article 25.
b. Status of future exceptions. Any use for which an exception has been
issued, as provided in these regulations, shall not be deemed to be a
nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a lawful
conforming use.

OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS
Section:
22-1 Purpose
22-2 General Provisions
22-3 Layout and Design Requirements
22-4 Permit Required
22-5 Required Parking Spaces
22-6 Exceptions by Board of Zoning Appeals
22-7 Waivers By Zoning Administrator
SECTION 22-1 PURPOSE
22-101. These regulations require off-street parking proportional to the need created by each use in
order to ensure functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing, and secure off-street parking facilities.
Regulations and standards are intended to ensure usefulness of parking and loading facilities, to protect
public safety, and where appropriate, to limit potential adverse impacts on adjacent property.
SECTION 22-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
22-201. Applicability. Off-street parking facilities, as required in this article, shall be provided for any
new building and for any new use established, additions to existing use, or any change in manner of
use which results in increased capacity. Additional parking need only be provided for the addition,
enlargement, or change and not the entire building or use. No off-street parking facilities shall be
required in the C-4 Central Business District.
22-202. Maintenance. All existing and required parking facilities shall be maintained and shall not be
reduced so long as the use requiring such parking remains.
22-203. Utilization. Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same site as the use
for which such facilities are required, except as authorized by Section 22-6. Such facilities shall be
used exclusively for temporary parking of motor vehicles and shall not be utilized for sale or storage of
merchandise, or for storage or repair of vehicles, equipment, or trailers.
22-204. Residential districts. Parking facilities which make provisions for more than three (3)
vehicles shall not be located within the required front yard for the district.
22-205. Computation. Where the determination of number of off-street parking spaces required
results in a fractional part of a space, a fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as a full space and
a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded. Where requirements are established on the
basis of seats or person capacity, the Uniform Building Code provisions applicable at the time shall be
22-2
used to calculate maximum design capacity.
22-206. Compact cars. In every off-street parking facility of ten (10) or more spaces, a maximum of
twenty-five (25) percent of the required number of spaces may be designed for compact cars. For the
purpose of this section, a compact car is a motor vehicle with an overall length which does not exceed
fourteen (14) feet.
22-207. Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve minor variations
from the size of parking spaces and up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the number of parking spaces
otherwise required under this Article when, in his or her discretion, such variation does not violate the
purpose of these regulations and does not harm public health, safety of welfare. Where a proposed use
is not listed in the parking schedule, the off-street parking requirements shall be determined by the
Zoning Administrator.
22-208. Sight Plan Review Committee. The Sight Plan Review Committee may wave up to fifty
percent (50%) of the number of parking spaces otherwise required under this Article when, in their
discretion, such variation does not violate the purpose of these regulations and does not harm public
health, safety or welfare.
SECTION 22-3 LAYOUT AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
22-301. Area size. Each required parking space shall consist of a rectangular area of not less than nine
(9) feet in width, by nineteen (19) feet in length. Each space for compact cars, when allowed by this
article shall consist of a rectangular area of not less than eight (8) feet in width, by seventeen (17) feet
in length. All required spaces shall be clearly marked and defined.
22-302. Access. Except in R-1 and R-2 districts, each required off-street parking space shall open
directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of
vehicular access to such parking space. Streets and alleys shall be used only for access to and from
parking facilities and shall not be used for maneuvering of vehicles. Any alley used for access to other
than residential uses requiring eight (8) or fewer parking spaces shall be paved according to the
specifications of the Engineer.
22-303. Design standards. Minimum parking facility design standards shall comply with Table 22-8.
22-304. Driveways. Driveway location and spacing shall comply with the Corridor Management
Policy Manual of the Kansas Department of Transportation. Site plans for commercial properties shall
include a traffic impact analysis and an internal traffic circulation plan making full use of shared
entrances. The Engineer is authorized to grant variances to the provisions of the Corridor Management
Policy Manual upon receiving a specific written request.
22-305. Surfacing. All off-street parking facilities, loading areas, vehicular storage areas and drives
and access to and from such areas shall be surfaced and maintained with a minimum of four (4) inches
of asphalt, or concrete meeting the specifications of the Engineer to create a permanent all-weather,
dust-free surface. Such paving must be completed prior to occupancy of the facility that the paving is
22-3
intended to serve, unless temporary occupancy approval is received from the site plan review
committee.
b. The Zoning Administrator upon receiving a specific written request from an owner of a property
may authorize six inches (6) of approved aggregate, as determined by the Engineer, as an alternative
to these surfacing requirements for the following:
1. Emergency access roads meeting the requirements of Section 20-15.
2. Driveways and parking areas beyond the district front building setback line in single family
residential zoning districts.
3. Driveways from gravel alleys to a rear garage or parking area.
c. The Site Plan Review Committee upon receiving a specific written request from an owner of a
property may authorize six inches (6) of approved aggregate as an alternative to these surfacing
requirements for the following:
1. Temporary occupancy for a time period not to exceed twelve (12) months prior to
accomplishing the required paving or a portion thereof. Should the owner receive approval of
the site plan review committee for a delay in paving, the owner shall, prior to occupancy,
present written verification to the zoning administrator that guarantees all paving shall be
complete prior to the deadline given by the site plan review committee.
2. Temporary Event Permit for parking related to events in Public Districts. Parking areas so
permitted shall be exempt from surfacing requirements during the event and for a period not to
exceed 4 days before or after the event.
3. A five (5) year exemption in industrial districts for driveways, parking and loading areas within
the limits of a designated future building expansion.
In reviewing a request for approval to use alternate surfacing materials, the site plan review committee
shall consider the following criteria:
a. Season of the year.
b. Affect on the adjoining property.
c. Surfacing of the connecting street.
d. Surfacing of existing adjoining parking facilities.
d. Gravel areas established prior to 1987 may continue to be used provided they are maintained with
six (6) inches of approved aggregate as an alternative to these surfacing requirements. The
determination about whether a parking area with an alternate surface is legally nonconforming shall be
22-4
made by the Zoning Administrator by reviewing aerial photography from 1986. Such a determination
may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
e. Exceptions:
1. Residential properties with no paved access may use approved aggregates for surfacing
provided an agreement is executed by all relevant parties to pave vehicular access and parking
areas within 12 months of paved street access being provided, said agreement shall be approved
as to form by the City Attorney.
2. Driveways and parking areas in residential districts may elect to pave only the vehicular wheel
tracks beyond the street right-of-way.
3. Approved brick pavers installed in accordance with construction methods approved by the
Engineer may be authorized as an alternative to concrete or asphalt surfacing.
4. Approved honeycomb or waffle-block grass pavers installed in accordance with construction
methods approved by the Engineer may be used for light traffic areas as determined by the
Zoning Administrator, such as overflow parking.
5. Semi-tractor-trailer parking areas in industrial districts.
22-306. Lighting. Any lighting provided to illuminate any parking facility shall be designed and
installed in such a manner as to reflect away from any residential use upon adjoining properties.
22-307. Drainage. All parking facilities shall be graded and/or designed with storm drainage facilities
so as to channel surface water away from adjoining properties and to an approved storm drainage
system.
22-308. Parking facilities in residential districts. Any parking facilities for eight (8) or more vehicles
when (1) in residential zoning districts and (2) which are adjacent to a residential or mobile homezoned
district, shall have a screened fence or wall to prevent the passage of vehicular lights and to
prevent the blowing of debris. Such fence or wall shall be at least six (6) feet in height and have a
visual density of not less than eighty (80) percent.

zoning district under the following provisions:
a. Location. Parking provided under this section must be within three hundred (300) feet (along
lines of public access) from the boundary of the use for which the parking is provided. Access to such
parking facilities from the use must be adequately lighted to provide for safety of the public.
b. Use. The parking area shall be used for passenger vehicles only, and in no case shall it be used
for sales, repair work, storage, dismantling or servicing of vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies.
Only such signs as are necessary for the proper operation of the parking lot shall be permitted.
c. Improvements. Parking areas and driveways on private property providing ingress and egress

City of Emporia, and two (2) members shall be appointed by the County Board of County
Commissioners. All members shall be appointed for three (3) year terms. Vacancies shall be
filled by appointment for the unexpired term by the Governing Body that originally appointed
the member vacating. One member of the board shall be a member of the Emporia-Lyon County

25-102. The board shall adopt rules of procedure as may be necessary and proper to
govern its own proceedings, including the establishment of a quorum and voting requirements;

board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and a concurring vote of a
majority of the entire membership of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirements, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or to decide in favor of the
applicant upon any matter which it is required to pass under these regulations or to affect any
variation in such regulations. When the board fails to receive a motion for a recommendation on
an appeal, or application for a variance or exception, the board shall be deemed to have denied
the appeal or application. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the
description of evidence presented, the findings of fact by the board, the decision of the board,
and the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such
fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
filed in the office of the board and shall be public record.
25-103. The secretary of the Emporia-Lyon County Metropolitan Area Planning Commission

by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the secretary
of the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken.
b. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
Zoning Administrator certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board, or by a court of record on
application or notice to the Zoning Administrator on good cause shown.
c. An appeal shall be sustained only if the board finds that the administrative official's
action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the official acted in an
arbitrary or capricious manner or manifestly abused his or her discretion.

be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall
not permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district.
a. The applicant must show that his or her property was acquired in good faith and where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of this specific piece of property at the
time of the effective date of the district zoning regulations, or where by reason of exceptional
topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances that the strict
application of the terms of the zoning regulations actually prohibit the use of his or her property

question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district; and is not
created by action of the property owner or applicant.
2. The granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of
adjacent property owners or residents.

variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property
owner represented in the application.

respect to streets giving access to it are such that the exception will not dominate
the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of neighboring
property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations. In
determining whether the exception will so dominate the immediate neighborhood,
consideration shall be given to:

SECTION 26-1 GENERAL AUTHORITY AND PROCEDURE
26-101. Who May Petition or Apply: Applications for amendments, revisions or
changes in the zoning district boundary maps or for a Conditional Use Permit
may be made by any person who owns the land for which such an amendment,
revisions, change or Conditional Use Permit is sought, or by the owners agent.
If such application is made by the owners agent, said agent shall enter upon the
application the name and current mailing address of the owner and shall submit
written authorization to act as agent for said owner prior to the setting of any
public hearing.
Applications for amendments, revisions or changes to the zoning regulations, the
zoning district boundary maps and/or conditional use may also be made by the
Planning Commission or the Governing Body; provided such proposed
amendments, revisions, changes, or conditional use shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for recommendation and report and the final decision is
made by the Governing Body.
26-102. Procedures for Consideration of Request for Amendments,
Revisions or Changes: All applications or requests for amendments, revisions
or changes to the zoning regulations, the zoning district boundary maps or for a
Conditional Use Permit shall be made to the Zoning Administrator on such forms
as provided and acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. The payment of the
application fee, as established by the fee ordinance, shall be made at the time of
the submission of the application. Immediately upon receipt of an application for
rezoning or conditional use by the owner, or agent, and the payment of the
appropriate fee, the Zoning Administrator shall note thereon the date of filing and
make a permanent record thereof.
All such proposed applications for amendment, revisions or changes to the
zoning regulations and/or for a conditional use shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for recommendation. The Planning Commission shall hold a public
hearing thereon and shall cause a written summary to be made of the
proceedings. Notice of such hearing shall be published once in the official
newspaper at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing. The date of
newspaper publication and the date of the hearing shall not be included in the
calculation of 20 days. Notice shall fix the time and place for the hearing, shall
give the name and address of the applicant, and shall contain a statement
regarding the proposed changes in regulations or restrictions, or in the boundary
or classification of any zone or district, or the requested conditional use.
If the application is not a general amendment, revision or change to the zoning
regulations, but is for a rezoning or Conditional Use Permit affecting specific
property, the property affected shall be designated by legal description and a
general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration. In
addition to such publication notice, written notice of such proposed rezoning or
conditional use shall be mailed at least 20 days before the public hearing to all
owners of record of the property affected and all owners of record of lands
located within at least 200 feet of the area proposed to be altered; provided, said
notice shall extend 1000 feet in those areas where the notification area extends
outside the corporate limits of the City. All notices shall include a statement that
a complete legal description is available for public inspection in the office of the
Zoning Administrator. When the notice has been properly addressed and
deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate
any subsequent action taken by the Planning Commission or shall not invalidate
any subsequent action taken by the Planning Commission or Governing Body.
The applicant shall provide a certified list of the owners of record of said lands at
the time of the filing of the application.
In the case of an application by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body,
all the above stated requirements shall be followed except:
1. No fee shall be required.
2. If the application is for an amendment or revision to the text of the
zoning regulations, notice of the public hearing shall not be required to be
mailed to all affected persons; therefore, a certified list of the owners of
land shall not be required.
26-103. Public Hearing Before Planning Commission: The Planning
Commission shall hold the public hearing at the place and time so stated within
the legal notice. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time, and at the
conclusion of the same, the Planning Commission shall take action on the
request by preparing a recommendation either to approve, approve with
conditions as authorized by these regulations, or disapprove the application by a
majority of the members of the Planning Commission present and voting at the
hearing. When the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation on an
application, the Planning Commission shall be deemed to have made a
recommendation of disapproval. Any such hearing may, for good cause at the
request of the applicant, or in the discretion of the Planning Commission, be
continued.
26-104. Action by Planning Commission and Governing Body:
a. Recommendations. Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, the
planning commission shall prepare and adopt its recommendations and shall
submit the same, together with a record of the hearing thereon to the appropriate
governing body. Said recommendation may be for approval, disapproval or
approval in part and reasons for the recommendations shall be included. If a
motion for approval fails to gain approval for any reason, the application is
deemed to have been denied and will be submitted to the governing body. If the
recommendation is for approval, the recommendation shall be in the form of an
ordinance (city) or resolution (county).
b. Amendments to text. When a proposed amendment would result in a
change in the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of zoning
classification of any specific property, the recommendation of the planning
commission shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such
proposed amendment and their reasons for recommending approval or denial.
c. Adoption of amendments. The city or county governing body shall not
consider an amendment which would result in a change of zoning classification
for a specific property, or any application for a Conditional Use Permit, until its
next regular meeting after the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period. A
proposed amendment which changes the text of the regulations but would not
result in change of zoning classification of any specific property may be
considered by the governing body without waiting for the lapse of the fourteen
(14) day protest period. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning
commission and any protest petitions that have been submitted, the governing
body shall consider the application and may 1) approve the recommendation of
the planning commission without change; 2) override the planning commissions
recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the governing body;
or 3) return such recommendation to the planning commission with a statement
specifying the basis for the governing bodys failure to approve or disapprove.
Upon return of a recommendation from the planning commission, the governing
body may take whatever action it deems necessary. Whenever a proposed
amendment is defeated by vote of the governing body, such amendment shall
not thereafter be passed without a further public hearing and notice thereof as
provided in this article.
d. If such amendment or Conditional Use Permit affects the boundaries of any
zone or district, the ordinance or resolution shall describe the boundaries as
amended, or if provision is made for the fixing of the same upon the official maps
which as been incorporated by reference, the amending ordinance or resolution
shall define the change or the boundary as amended, shall order the official
maps be changed to reflect such amendment or Conditional Use, shall amend
the section of the ordinance or resolution incorporating the same and shall
reincorporate such maps as amended.
26-105. Protest Petition: Regardless of whether or not the Planning
Commission approves or disapproves a proposed zoning amendment,
supplement, change, or Conditional Use Permit, if a protest petition against such
amendment is filed in the office of the City Clerk or the County Clerk within
fourteen (14) days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant
to the publication notice, signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of
any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners of record of twenty
(20) percent or more of the total area, excepting public streets and ways, which is
located within the notification area described in 26-102, the ordinance or
resolution adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4
majority vote of all the members of the governing body. Immediately upon
receiving the filing of such a protest petition the Clerk shall notify the Zoning
Administrator of such petition.
26-106. Limitations on Successive Applications: Provisions for a limitation
on successive applications to the Planning Commission shall be as follows:
a. No application for an amendment to these regulations including the zoning
map shall be accepted by the Planning Commission if an application for the
same amendment has been denied by the Planning Commission within the
preceding twelve (12) months. The withdrawal of an application after it has been
advertised for public hearing shall constitute a denial of the application just as if
the public hearing had been held and concluded. For good cause shown by the
applicant the Governing Body or County Board may waive the twelve (12) month
requirements.
b. Irrespective of the preceding subsection, an application for a rehearing
may be accepted by the Planning Commission if in the judgment of the Planning
Commission substantial justification is given. All such applications for a
rehearing must be submitted to the secretary at least fifteen (15) days in advance
of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the planning commission, following the
denial of the application and shall be included on the agenda as a non-public
hearing item. If the Planning Commission determines that there has been
substantial change or justification for a rehearing, the item will be advertised and
a public hearing held at the next regular scheduled meeting of the Planning
Commission.
26-107. Posting of Sign: An applicant for a rezoning or for a Conditional Use
Permit may be required by the Zoning Administrator to place a sign upon the lot,
tract or parcel of land for which the application was filed. Said sign shall be
furnished by the Zoning Administrator to the applicant and the applicant shall
firmly affix and attach the sign to a wood or metal backing or frame and place the
sign as hereinafter set forth.
Said sign shall be in a form prepared by the Zoning Administrator and shall state:
that zoning action is pending before the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission;
the place, time and date of any scheduled public hearing or the matter; and a
telephone number for office address for which members of the public may obtain
additional information on the pending action.
Said sign shall be maintained and kept in place by the applicant until final
disposition of the application, or until withdrawal of the application. The sign shall
be removed by the applicant after final action on the application. The bottom of
the sign shall be a minimum of two (2) feet above the ground line. The sign shall
be placed within five (5) feet of the street right-of-way line, in a position on such
lot, tract or parcel of land as to have no visual obstructions thereto and to be
readily seen by passersby. If the lot, tract or parcel of land has more than one
(1) street abutting thereto, signs shall be placed facing all street frontages.
Failure to comply with this requirement shall not deprive the Planning
Commission of its jurisdiction or affect any decision, but may be due cause for
the Planning Commission to refuse to hear the application or to adjourn the
hearing or to require further notice.
26-108. Factors to be Considered in a Rezoning: When a proposed
amendment would result in a change of the zoning classification of any specific
property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission, accompanied by a
copy of the record of the hearing, shall contain statements as to the present
classification, the classification under the proposed amendment, the reasons for
seeking such reclassification, a summary of the facts presented, and a statement
of the factors upon which the recommendation of the Planning Commission is
based using the following guidelines:
1. Whether the change in classification would be consistent with the intent
and purpose of these regulations;
2. The character and condition of the surrounding neighborhood and its
effect on the proposed change;
3. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of
changed or changing conditions in the area affected, and, if so, the nature
of such changed or changing conditions;
4. The current zoning and uses of nearby properties, and the effect on
existing nearby land uses upon such a change in classification;
5. Whether every use that would be permitted on the property as
reclassified would be compatible with the uses permitted on other property
in the immediate vicinity;
6. The suitability of the applicants property for the uses to which it has
been restricted;
7. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or
undeveloped as zoned; provided, the use of land for agricultural purposes
shall be considered as allowing the land to be vacant or undeveloped;
8. Whether adequate sewer and water facilities, and all other needed
public services, including transportation, exist or can be provided to serve
the uses that would be permitted on the property if it were reclassified;
9. The general amount of vacant land that currently has the same zoning
classification proposed for the subject property, particularly in the vicinity
of the subject property, and any special circumstances that make a
substantial part of such vacant land available or not available for
development;
10. The recommendations of professional staff;
11. Whether the proposed amendment would be in conformance to and
further enhance the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
12. Whether the relative gain to the public health, safety , and general
welfare outweighs the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not
upgrading the value of the property by such reclassification; and,
13. Such other factors as may be relevant from the facts and evidence
presented in the application.
26-109. Factors to be Considered in an Application for a Conditional Use
Permit: Because of particular conditions associated with their activities, certain
uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the
character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in
districts, but are permitted as conditional uses when their proposed location is
supplemented by additional requirements so as to make the use requested
compatible with the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the zoning
jurisdiction.
In approving a conditional use, the minimum requirements set out in these
regulations for the underlying district must be met unless otherwise reduced by
specific reference in the approval of the Governing Body. The requirements may
be made more stringent if there are potentially injurious effects which may be
anticipated upon other property or the neighborhood or which may be contrary to
public health, safety or welfare.
The Planning Commission may recommend approval of a Conditional Use that is
expressly authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district, and the
Governing Body may approve such Conditional Use, using the following factors
as guidelines:
1. Whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with
the intent and purpose of these regulations;
2. Whether the location of the proposed use is compatible to other
land uses in the surrounding neighborhood;
3. Whether the proposed use places an undue burden on the existing
transportation and service facilities in the area affected and, if so, whether
such additional transportation and service facilities can be provided;
4. Whether the proposed use is made necessary or desirable because
of changed or changing conditions in the area affected;
5. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or
undeveloped as zoned; (the use of land for agricultural purposes shall be
considered as viable use of the land and not be considered as allowing
the land to be vacant or undeveloped);
6. Whether the applicants property is suitable for the proposed
conditional use;
7. The recommendations of professional staff;
8. Whether the proposed conditional use would be in conformance to
and further enhance the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
9. Whether the relative gain to the public health, safety, and general
welfare outweighs the hardship imposed on the applicant by not upgrading
the value of the property by approving the proposed conditional use;
10. Whether the proposed conditional use, if it complies with all the
conditions upon which the approval is made contingent, will not adversely
affect the property in the area affected;
11. For uses as solid waste disposal facilities, including sanitary
landfills, construction and demolition landfills and transfer stations,
whether the proposed conditional use is consistent with the adopted Solid
Waste Management Plan of Lyon County, and amendments thereto; and
12. Such other factors as may be relevant from the facts and evidence
presented in the application.
26-110. Traffic Studies: In the case of an application for rezoning of land or for
a Conditional Use Permit for a use which may, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, substantially change traffic patterns, or create traffic congestion,
the Planning Commission may require that the applicant procure the services of
a competent professional traffic engineer for the purpose of preparing a traffic
study to be presented to the Planning Commission prior to its taking action on an
application for rezoning or for a Conditional Use Permit. Such traffic study shall
show that the traffic generated by the proposed development will be handled on
the site in an orderly and efficient manner, that vehicular ingress and egress from
the site onto public streets will function in an orderly and efficient manner and
that no undue burden will be placed upon the existing public street system. The
results of the traffic study shall be used in determining the impact of the proposed
rezoning or Conditional Use Permit and guide the development of a
recommendation or decision regarding the same.
26-111. Platting: Approval of any rezoning may be conditioned upon approval of
final platting of some or all the property to be rezoned.
SECTION 26-2 CONDITIONAL ZONING
26-201. The Planning Commission, subject to final approval by the City or
County Governing Body, or such Governing Body at its initiative, in the process
of rezoning land may limit the uses which are permitted in the district to which
land is to be rezoned. Such a limitation shall be finally approved by the City or
County Governing Body only upon a finding that such limitation upon permitted
uses is necessary to protect public health, safety or general welfare and is
consistent with the purposes of these regulations.
26-201. The Planning Commission, subject to final approval by the City or
County Governing Body, or such Governing Body at its initiative, in the process
of rezoning land may limit the uses which are permitted in the district to which
land is to be rezoned. Such a limitation shall be finally approved by the City or
County Governing Body only upon a finding that such limitation upon permitted
uses is necessary to protect public health, safety or general welfare and is
consistent with the purposes of these regulations.
SECTION 26-3 TABLE OF LESSER CHANGE
26-301. The following Table of Lesser Change is for the use of the Planning
Commission in determining when republication of an application for rezoning is
required. This Table of Lesser Change designates which zoning classifications
are lesser changes authorized within the published zoning classifications. The
Table of Lesser Change lists zoning classifications in descending order from the
most restrictive zoning district to the least restrictive zoning district. The Planning
Commission may modify, at its discretion, an application for rezoning to a
particular district by recommending a rezoning to a district of lesser restriction, as
determined by the Table of Lesser Change. However, no such modification by
the Planning Commission shall result in a rezoning (a) from a classification where
residential uses are a permitted or conditional use to a classification where
residential uses are not so allowed; (b) from a classification where residential
uses are not a permitted or conditional use to a classification where residential
uses are so allowed; or (c) from any non-agricultural district to Agricultural (A-L).

SECTION 26-4 TIME OF PERFORMANCE IN REZONING
26-401. a. In cases where the Planning Commission and Governing Body
deem that time of development is a critical factor in protecting the public welfare
in a rezoning action, a time of performance may be included in the rezoning
ordinance. Such time allowed for performance shall be reasonable. Such time
shall be not less than five years from the effective date of the ordinance for all
rezonings into districts in which single-family dwellings are allowed and not less
than two years from the effective date of the resolution for all rezonings into
districts in which single-family dwellings are not allowed. Such ordinance shall
state what constitutes performance in each case.
b. If at the termination of such stipulated period of time performance as
required has not occurred, the Planning Commission may, within a reasonable
time thereafter, publish notice and conduct a public hearing for purposes of
determining whether or not to change the zoning to a more restrictive district.
The owner of the property in question shall be notified by registered mail of the
proposed hearing not less than 20 days prior to the date of the hearing. Other
notification and posting as required in this section shall be performed and all
proceedings shall be the same as for other rezoning actions.
c. It shall be the purpose of this hearing to hear the owner and other
interested parties and make a determination as to which of the following actions
would be recommended to the Governing Body.
1. Extend the time of performance to a specified date,
2. Remove the time of performance, or
3. Rezone the land.
d. After the hearing the Planning Commission shall forward its
recommendations to the Governing Body. The Governing Body will then act to
approve or disapprove the recommended action, consistent with these
regulations.

of the permit is not limited in time.
26-503. Upon approval of a Conditional Use Permit, the Zoning District Map
shall be changed in the manner outlined in this Article.
26-504. The Planning Commission may revoke any Conditional Use Permit upon
finding that (a) necessary building permits have not been issued within twelve
(12) months of approval of the Conditional Use Permit or (b) if no building permit
is required for the use allowed under the Conditional Use Permit, that the use so
allowed has not been commenced within twelve (12) months of the approval of
the Conditional Use Permit.
26-505. In all instances where a use was allowed under a valid Conditional Use
Permit properly issued prior to the effective date of these regulations, which such
use would be a nonconforming use under these regulations but for the issuance
of such permit, the property owner shall continue to comply with the conditions
set forth in that permit until the permit expires or is otherwise terminated in
accordance with the provisions of these regulations.
SECTION 26-6 FEES FOR REZONINGS AND CONDITIONAL USE
PERMITS

26-701. For uses not specifically listed in the district use tables, the Zoning
Administrator shall have the authority to determine the appropriate district or
districts which allow the use based on the uses similarity to listed uses. Such
determination shall be in the form of a written declatory ruling, a copy of which
shall be presented to the Planning Commission at the next regularly scheduled
meeting.

and excessive runoff.
c. Action by site plan review committee. The site plan review committee shall review the
plan according to the procedures and using criteria established by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this
section to make a determination. The committee shall notify the applicant by mail within five
(5) days of action taken by the committee and such action shall be binding unless an appeal is
submitted as provided herein.
d. Appeal to the governing body. A decision of the site plan review committee to approve
or deny a site plan may be appealed to the governing body by the applicant or owners of property
within one hundred (100) feet of the property considered in the site plan review. Such appeal
must be made in writing to the office of the city clerk within ten (10) days of the action by the
site plan review committee, specifying the particular items which are being appealed.

appeal. Action taken by the governing body shall be binding on all parties.

diligently pursued toward completion. Any site plan which has been voided may only be
reinstated by a re-submission of a new site plan application.
SECTION 28-5 OCCUPANCY OR USE
28-501. No occupancy of new construction will be permitted until all conditions of the site plan
approval have been complied with, and businesses doing exterior remodeling must comply with
all provisions at the time of completion of remodeling. Provided, that consideration will be
given to seasons of the year and adverse weather conditions in requiring completion of
landscaping plans, but further provided that such required landscaping must be completed within
six (6) months following occupancy under such consideration.
SECTION 28-6 CHANGE OF USE
28-601. A site plan approved pursuant with the provisions of this article shall run with the land
and apply to the type of business or activity which was originally applied for. A subsequent
change of use to another type of use requiring site plan approval will require approval of a new
site plan.
