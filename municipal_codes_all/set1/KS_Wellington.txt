PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Wellington, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1996 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1996 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Gus Collins, City Manager; Rose Miller, City Clerk; Michael Brown, City Attorney; John Lloyd, Fire Chief; Tracy Heath, Police Chief; Jeremy Jones, Public Works Director; Larry Mangan, City Engineer; Cliff Zens, Electric Distribution Supervisor; and Gil Berryman, Wastewater Supervisor, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(e)  A non-service connected disability annuity shall begin to accrue upon the commencement of the disability, provided that if the member is receiving salary or compensation, the annuity shall begin to accrue from the date the salary or compensation has ceased. If written application shall not have been filed with the board prior to the expiration of ninety days from the date of disability, the annuity shall begin to accrue from the date application therefore has been filed, but in no event prior to the time when payments to the member on account of salary or compensation have ceased. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the provisions contained in SECTION 7(c) above, pertaining to non-service connected disabilities, a member shall be allowed to earn additional income, without reduction of the annuity herein provided for non-service connected disabilities, in an amount sufficient to make the total of the members extra earnings together with his annuity equal his final average monthly rate of pay computed on the basis of the 12 months immediately prior to the date on which annuity begins to accrue. The annuity shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%) of the amount the members extra earnings exceed his final average monthly rate of pay computed as aforesaid. The foregoing limitations on earning additional income shall cease when the member becomes eligible to retire by reason of age and years of service. 
    SECTION 8. Administration of Disability Annuities. 
(a)  The determination of disability from any cause shall be made upon the basis of reports of examinations made by at least two (2) physicians designated by the Board. 
(b)  A member receiving service connected or non-service connected disability annuity shall be required to submit to an examination at least once each year by a physician or physicians designated by the Board to determine whether the member is incapacitated for active service as a policeman or fireman and is entitled to receive a disability annuity. The Board may terminate a disability annuity upon evidence that the member is no longer disabled for service, or if the member fails or refuses to submit to such examination for ten (10) days after he is notified to submit to such examination. If upon such termination the member does not reenter service, he shall be entitled to a refund of the excess, if any, of his contributions to the pension fund created herein, without interest, over the amount received by the member as a disability annuity. 
(c)  If a medical examination or an investigation made by the board discloses that the member is engaged or is able to engage in any gainful occupation resulting in earnings for services rendered in any capacity, the disability annuity shall be reduced to an amount which, when added to the members income from such gainful occupation, does not exceed the current monthly salary being paid for the position or rank similar to that held by the member at the commencement of his disability. If the examination or investigation aforesaid discloses that the member is able to engage in any gainful occupation, and the member fails or refuses so to do, then and in that event the disability annuity shall be terminated. 
(d)  Any member receiving a disability annuity under the provisions of this Ordinance shall submit to the board at least once each year in a form to be determined by the board a full, complete and accurate statement of income for the preceding 12 months. Such statement of income may be used as a basis for adjusting any annuity payments made to a member under the provisions of this Ordinance. If the member fails or refuses to furnish the board such statement of income within 10 days after the board requests the same, or if the board determines that some material information contained in such statement of income is false the disability annuity shall be terminated. 
(e)  Any disability annuity terminated because of the members failure or refusal to submit to an examination or re-examination by a physician, or because of the members failure or refusal to engage in a gainful occupation when it is disclosed by a medical examination or investigation by the board that the member is able to do so, or because of the members failure or refusal to submit a full, complete and accurate statement of income, shall be reinstated by the board at such time as it determines that the member is in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance under which the annuity was terminated. If the member fails for one year to comply with the aforesaid provisions the terminated disability shall not be reinstated, and the same shall be revoked by the board. 
    SECTION 9. Service Connected Death. 
(a)  Upon the death of a member resulting directly from service connected causes or from an occupational disease, a surviving widow shall be entitled to an annuity equal to fifty percent (50%) of the final average monthly salary of the decedent computed on the basis of the 12 months immediately preceding the death, or the amount the decedent would have received monthly under section 11 of this Ordinance if he be deemed to have retired at the time of his death, whichever amount is greater. 
(b)  In the event the decedent leaves no surviving widow, or in the event a surviving widow remarries or dies, then and in any of such events any surviving child or children of the deceased member under the age of 18 years shall receive fifty percent (50%) of the decedent's final average monthly salary computed on the basis of the 12 months immediately preceding the death until said child or the youngest of said children reaches the age of 18 years, or marries, whichever occurs first. In the event there is more than one surviving child eligible for benefits under the provisions of this Section 9(b), then and in that event the total benefits due hereunder shall be divided equally among the eligible children. 
    SECTION 10. Non-service Connected Death. 
(a)  Upon the death of a member resulting from non-service connected causes, if the member had at least five (5) years of credited service, a surviving widow shall be entitled to an annuity equal to the amount the deceased member would have received monthly under Section 11 of this Ordinance if he be deemed to have retired at the time of his death. 
(b)  In the event the decedent leaves no surviving widow, or in the event a surviving widow remarries or dies, then and in any of such events any surviving child or children of the deceased member under the age of 18 years shall receive the amount fixed by Section 10(a) of this Ordinance until said child or the youngest of said children reaches the age of 18 years, or marries, whichever occurs first. In the event there is more than one surviving child eligible for benefits under the provisions of this Section 10(b), then and in that event the total benefits due hereunder shall be divided equally among the eligible children. 
(c)  If, under the provisions of this Ordinance, the beneficiaries named in this Section 10 are determined not to be entitled to any benefits, such beneficiaries shall be entitled to fifty percent (50%) of all moneys contributed by the deceased member to the Policemen's or Firemen's Pension Fund of the City prior to the effective date of this Ordinance plus one hundred percent (100%) of all moneys contributed by the deceased member to the pension fund herein created subsequent to the effective date of this Ordinance. 
    SECTION 11. Service Annuity Retirement. 
(a)  Any member having credited service of 22 years or more and having reached the age of 50 years may make application to be retired, and if such application is made the board shall retire such member and pay him monthly payments in an amount equal to 2.28% of his final average monthly salary computed on the basis of the 12 months immediately prior to retirement multiplied by the number of years of credited service plus 1.1% of said final average monthly salary for each year of credited service in excess of 22 years, provided, however, that in no event shall the service annuity paid hereunder exceed 66% of the members final average monthly salary. 
(b)  If any member be discharged or terminated by resignation of for any other reason after having credited service of 22 years, the board shall order and direct that said member, upon attaining the age of 50 years, be paid monthly payments computed as provided in Section 11(a), above, and subject to the 66% limitation contained therein, except that the members final average monthly salary shall be computed on the basis of the 12 months immediately prior to his discharge or termination by resignation or other reason. 
    SECTION 12. Payment to Widow After Death of Retired Member. If any member should die after having retired for age and service, or for service only or for service connected disability, leaving a widow, said widow, so long as she remains such widow, shall receive monthly an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the decedent's average monthly compensation computed on the basis of the 12 months immediately preceding his retirement. 
    SECTION 13. Accounting and Actuarial Studies. 
(a)  The assets of the system shall be held for the express purposes set forth in the provisions of this Ordinance subject to the conditions prescribed herein. An adequate system of accounts and records shall be established and maintained to give effect to the requirements hereof and all assets of the system shall be credited to accounts according to the purposes for which they are held. 
(b)  An actuarial survey of the system shall be made at such times as the board deems proper and appropriate to check the mortality, turnover, disability, interest and other actuarial factors assumed in calculations of liabilities and costs. An annual actuarial valuation of the system shall be made at the close of each fiscal year for the purpose of establishing its financial condition and checking its current operating experience. 
    SECTION 14. Management - Policy Direction. 
(a)  The system created by this Ordinance shall be construed to be a trust, separate and distinct from all other entities. The responsibility for the direction and operation of the system, and for making effective the provisions hereof, are hereby vested in a board of trustees, which board shall be directly responsible to the governing body of the city.

(c)  A permanent trustee shall continue in office until his successor is elected or appointed, and has qualified. Any trustee who is a policeman or fireman shall be disqualified to serve in that capacity upon termination of service with the city. If a vacancy occurs in the office of elective trustee, a successor shall be elected for the unexpired term of office within 30 days by a special election, unless the regular bi-annual election occurs sooner. If a vacancy occurs in the office of an appointive trustee, such vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the office was previously filled. 
(d)  Each trustee shall take an oath that, so far as it devolves upon him, he will diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the board, and that he will not knowingly or willfully permit to be violated any of the provisions of the ordinance applicable to the system. Such oath shall be subscribed by the person taking it, and certified by the officer before whom it is taken, and immediately filed with the City Clerk. A trustee shall be deemed to have qualified for membership on the board when such oath shall have been filed.

The annual meeting shall be held on the third Wednesday of January of each year. All meetings shall be open to the public. A record of proceedings of all meetings shall be kept by the board and a copy thereof filed with the City Clerk. 
(f)  Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board, and the concurrence of five trustees shall be necessary for a decision at any regular or special meeting. A trustee shall receive no salary as such while serving in that capacity.

    SECTION 18. Exemptions. The right to a service retirement annuity, disability annuity, death annuity or any annuity or benefit under the provisions of this Ordinance, by whatever name called, or a refund, is personal with the recipient thereof, and the assignment or transfer of any such annuity or benefit or any part thereof shall be void, except as may be provided herein. Any such annuity or benefit shall not answer for debts contracted by the person receiving the same, and it is the intention of this Ordinance that such annuity or benefits shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment, or affected by any judicial proceedings including bankruptcy. 
    SECTION 19. Monthly Payments. Any service retirement annuity, disability annuity, death annuity or any other annuity provided herein shall be payable in equal monthly installments as a life annuity except as herein otherwise provided.

    SECTION 20. Fraud. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, or falsifies or permits to be falsified, any record or records of this system, in any attempt to defraud the system, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.

If any such person be a member of the system, or the beneficiary of a member, he/she shall forfeit all rights to further participation in any of the benefits hereunder. 
    SECTION 21. Creation and Maintenance of Fund. 
(a)  For the purpose of funding the system and financing and paying the cost of the annuities and benefits herein provided for there is hereby created a fund to be known as the Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement Fund into which Fund there shall be placed the following: 
(1)  Superseded pension funds which shall consist of all cash, securities and other assets accumulated by any policemen's pension fund or firemen's pension fund pursuant to any prior statute or ordinance of the city; 
(2)  An assessment against each member equal to four percent (4%) of his monthly salary and compensation, the same to be deducted from the regular payroll and transferred to this Fund; 
(3)  Proceeds from the sale of lost or stolen securities, money or other personal property which shall remain unclaimed in possession of the Police Department or the Fire Department of the city for more than six (6) months, together with the proceeds from the sale of unclaimed or confiscated property of any nature whatsoever which shall have been in custody of the Police Department for a period of more than six (6) months; and the city is hereby authorized to sell such property at public auction at such times as it deems appropriate; 
(4)  Gifts, grants, bequests, and gratuities of money or other property given to this Fund; and the city and board are hereby authorized to receive the same for placement in this Fund. If property other than cash is so received for this Fund, the board may, at its discretion, convert such property into cash or retain the same in the form it was at the time of its receipt; 
(5)  Proceeds of the tax levy hereinafter provided for, for the purpose of funding the system. 
(b)  There shall be deducted from the salary of every member, beginning on the first day of the month after the effective date of this Ordinance, four percent (4%) of his monthly salary and compensation, which sum shall be paid into the fund created in Section 21(a), above, of this Ordinance. 
(c)  For the purpose of funding all obligations of the system under the provisions of this Ordinance over and above member contributions and other income and receipts accruing to and received by the system, as herein provided, the city shall levy a tax upon all taxable tangible property in the city, which levy shall be in addition to the levies now authorized by law for corporate or other purposes. 
    SECTION 22. Refund of Member's Contributions. 
(a)  Any member who is discharged or whose services are terminated by resignation from either the Police Department or the Fire Department prior to retirement shall be entitled, upon demand, to be paid within ninety (90) days after such demand an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the deductions from his salary and compensation paid into the prior Police Pension Fund or the prior Firemen's Pension Fund of the city and accrued for service rendered prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and the full amount of any deductions made under Section 21(b) of this Ordinance accruing on or after the effective date of this Ordinance. The payment of the sums provided for in the foregoing sentence shall automatically effect a waiver and forfeiture of all accrued rights and benefits of the member to whom the payment is made in the system. This Section 22(a) is to be construed as not to apply to any person receiving a disability annuity under the provisions of this Ordinance. 
(b)  Any member who has received a refund under Section 22(a) of this Ordinance shall be considered a new member upon subsequent re-employment by the Police or Fire Departments, provided that such member shall render at least three (3) years of service following his latest re-entry into service, and he shall be entitled to regain his previously forfeited credited service upon repayment of all amounts received as such refund plus regular interest from the date of the members receipt of such refund to the date of repayment. The time and manner of making such repayment shall be fixed by the board. 
(c)  If a member dies leaving no persons eligible for a death annuity under the provisions of this Ordinance, there shall be paid to any person named or designated in a written designation signed, acknowledged, and filed with the board by the decedent before his death, the amount of the decedent's contributions to the system that he would have been entitled to under Section 22(a) of this Ordinance had he been discharged or terminated by resignation before his death. In the event that more than one written designation is filed by the same member, the written designation last filed shall take precedence. In the event no written designation shall have been filed prior to the death, the amount that would have been paid to a designee, had there been such, will be paid to the decedent's legal representative. 
(d)  In the event that all beneficiaries of a deceased member, namely the surviving widow and children under the age of 18 years, lose their eligibility to receive any annuity that said beneficiaries had been receiving under the provisions of this Ordinance, then and in that event, there shall be paid to any person named or designated in a written designation in accordance with the requirements for said written designation hereinabove set forth in Section 22(c) of this Ordinance the amount, if any, by which the sum the deceased member would have been entitled to receive under Section 22(a) of this Ordinance had he been discharged or terminated by resignation at the time of his death exceeds the total amount paid to the member and his surviving widow and children under 18 years of age under the provisions of this Ordinance. In the event no person has been named or designated, as mentioned above, any sum due under this Section 22(d) shall be paid to the decedent's legal representative. 
    SECTION 23. Benefit and Disability Rights Under Prior Laws Saved. This Ordinance shall not affect the existing rights of any policeman or fireman, or his widow or children under 18 years of age, who has heretofore been killed, permanently disabled, or has died or has retired because of age and, or years of credited service under the Firemen's Pension Fund, the same being Sections 9-301 to 9-312, inclusive, of the Code of the City of Wellington, Kansas 1969, or under the Police Pension Fund, the same being Sections 16-301 to 16-312, inclusive, of the Code of the City of Wellington, Kansas 1969.

    SECTION 25. Invalidity of Part. If any provisions of this Ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this Ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this extent the provisions of this Ordinance are declared to be severable. 
    SECTION 26. Repealer. That Sections 9-301 to 9-312, inclusive, and Sections 16-301 to 16-312, inclusive of the Code of the City of Wellington, Kansas 1969, are hereby repealed.

(2)  The past history and seriousness of any attacks or wounds inflicted by the animal; and/or 
(3)  The dog has exhibited an aggressive and vicious propensity toward persons or domestic animals and is capable of inflicting serious physical harm or death or damage to property; and/or

If the city building official finds that such proposed building, structure or improvement meets the required standards, the building official shall issue a permit therefore.

The subdivision or re-subdivision of the tract of lots does not place an existing permanent structure in violation of the requirements of the zoning regulations. 
(d)  If the planning commission fails to act on the final plat within 60 days after it has been submitted for approval, it shall be deemed to have been approved unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation. 
(e)  Before a final plat is recorded, it shall be submitted to the governing body for its approval and acceptance of dedications for streets and other public ways, service and utility easements, and any land dedicated for public use. If the governing body disapproves the final plat, they shall advise the subdivider in writing of the reasons for such disapproval. 
(f)  The governing body shall either approve or disapprove the final plat within 60 days after it has been submitted to them for final approval. If they fail to act on the final plat within 60 days, it shall be deemed to have been approved unless the subdivider shall have consented to extend or waive such time limitation. 
(g)  The final plat, with all required signatures and in the exact form as approved by the governing body, shall be recorded by the subdivider with the county register of deeds.

(b)  The design of the subdivision shall provide for efficient traffic flow, proper mixing of land uses, and a logical link between surrounding, existing development, and the proposed layout. The comprehensive plan should be used as a guide in determining if the design of the proposed subdivision is proper. The planning commission shall have the authority to deny a plat or request redesign, if, in its opinion, the layout is not suitable for the site, or if the development of the subdivision would be premature. 
(c)  The subdivider may be required to have an engineer's study prepared to determine the amount of increased stormwater runoff that will be created by the proposed development and a plan of how this runoff will be accommodated. The city may require design modification of the proposed stormwater system to reduce increased runoff. 
(d)  Where appropriate, conservation of energy through the use of both passive and active solar systems is encouraged. To accommodate solar design, streets in residential subdivisions should, where possible, have an east-west alignment. Lots intended for detached dwellings should be of sufficient width to allow the structure to be built with its longest axis running east-west. 
(e)  Any subdivider may grant or establish a solar skyspace easement to protect solar energy systems from being shaded. The easements shall be created in writing and shall be recorded separately or be written on the face of the plat. Any such easements shall be written to run with the land.

The application shall be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all persons who own property within 1,000 feet of the property proposed to be split if such property is outside and not adjacent to the incorporated area. For properties adjoining a city boundary, names and addresses shall be provided for all owners within 200 feet in the incorporated area. Written notices shall be given by the applicant to all such owners.

(Code 1983; Code 1996,  14-405) 
Sec. 36-130. - Release of motor vehicle from impoundment. 
(a)  Generally. Unless the vehicle is impounded pursuant to section 36-127(2), the owner of an impounded motor vehicle may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment upon requesting such release and presenting proof of ownership satisfactory to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored. If the custodian is satisfied that the person making the request is the owner or the owner's authorized agent, the custodian shall release the motor vehicle to the owner or the owner's agent. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the owner of the impounded motor vehicle or the owner's agent from paying any towing and storage charges that may be assessed against the motor vehicle, but neither the police department nor the custodian of the storage space may require payment of any towing or storage charges as a condition precedent to such release. At the same time as the owner or the owner's agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle, and if such request is made with 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, the police department shall provide the owner an opportunity to make a request for a hearing on the propriety of the impoundment and on the amount and the owner's liability for the towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; provided that if the owner or the owner's agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle more than 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, no hearing may be requested on the impoundment or on the towing and storage charges and the owner shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the impoundment and to the amount of and the owner's liability for the towing and storage charges. 
(b)  Security for payment of charges. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a title certificate issued by the state department of highway safety and motor vehicles, the owner or the owner's agent may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment without the payment of any towing or storage charges or the deposit of any security for the payment thereof. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a foreign title instrument, or if the jurisdiction in which title is recorded is not evidence from the document establishing ownership, the owner or the owner's agent, before the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored authorizes release of the motor vehicle form impoundment, shall deposit with the custodian cash in the amount of the towing and storage charges to the date of the request. If the owner or the owner's agent refuses to provide the cash deposit, the custodian shall not authorize release of the impounded motor vehicle but if the request is timely made, a date shall be set for the hearing on the impoundment and charges. 
(Code 1983; Code 1996,  14-406) 
Sec. 36-131. - Hearing. 
(a)  If the owner of an impounded motor vehicle or the owner's agent timely requests the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment and a hearing on the impoundment and charges, as provided in section 36-130, a date shall be set, not more than five days after the date of request, for the hearing. The city attorney shall provide a hearing examiner to conduct the hearings required by this section. At the hearing, the owner, the owner's agent, or the owner's attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to present, by oral testimony or documentary evidence, the owner's objections to the impoundment of the motor vehicle; and the amount of the towing and storage charges and the owner's liability for the payment thereof. If the owner or the owner's agent requested the hearing more than five days but not more than 40 days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment, the owner, the owner's agent or the owner's attorney shall be required at the hearing, as a condition precedent to the presentation of any objections by the owner, to show good cause for the delay in making the request more than five days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment; if good cause cannot be shown, the hearing officer shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding stated in subsection (b) of this section; otherwise, the hearing examiner shall proceed to hear the owner's objections. At the conclusion of the hearing on the owner's objections, the hearing examiner shall render the hearing examiner's decision if the hearing examiner: 
(1)  Finds that the impoundment was improper, he shall: 
a.  Find that the owner is not liable for any towing or storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; and 
b.  Determine whether and to what extent the city shall be the expense of the towing and storage charges; or 
(2)  Finds that the impoundment was proper, he shall establish: 
a.  The amount of the towing and storage charges to be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle; and 
b.  The extent of the liability of the owner for payment of the towing and storage charges so established. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, and a copy of the decision shall be furnished to the owner of the impounded motor vehicle, to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored and to the city attorney. 
(b)  In the event that the impoundment was pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102(6), the owner or occupant of the real property upon which the abandoned vehicle was located shall not be assessed the costs of towing and storage of the vehicle. Further, nothing within this article shall be construed to modify or effect the validity of the possessory lien of the person removing such vehicle from the real property established by K.S.A. 8-1102(b). 
(Code 1983; Code 1996,  14-407) 
Sec. 36-132. - Charges constitute a lien. 
    The towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment of a motor vehicle pursuant to section 36-126 shall be and constitute a lien upon the impounded motor vehicle, except as provided in this section. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 36-131 that the impoundment was improper and if the hearing examiner determines that the city shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the lien created by this section shall be discharged. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to section 36-130 that the impoundment was proper but that the towing and storage charges should be in an amount less than the amount of the lien, the lien created by this section shall be discharged to the extent that it exceeds the amount established by the hearing examiner. The holder of a lien created by this section may perfect such lien in any manner provided by law, but the lienholder may not retain possession of the motor vehicle when it has been released pursuant to section 36-130(a). In the event that the impounded motor vehicle is released from impoundment and the owner or the owner's agent has provided security for payment of charges as required by section 36-130(b), the lien created by this section shall also be a lien against the security so provided, subject to being wholly or partially discharged as provided in this section. 
(Code 1983; Code 1996,  14-408) 
Sec. 36-133. - Satisfaction of lien; notice of public sale. 
    The holder of a lien against a motor vehicle created by section 36-132, to the extent that such lien has not been discharged as provided in section 36-132 or otherwise satisfied, may enforce such lien in any manner provided by law after 60 days from the date the motor vehicle is impounded by the police department. If the owner of the motor vehicle or the owner's agent has provided security for the payment of the lien as provided in section 36-130(b), the lien shall first be satisfied out of the security so provided and, if any portion of the lien remains unsatisfied and undischarged, may then be enforced in any manner provided by law. If the motor vehicle against which the lien is created pursuant to section 36-132 is still under impoundment 60 days from the date it is impounded by the police department and the owner has not requested release of the motor vehicle from impoundment nor paid the towing and storage charges that are the basis for the lien, the motor vehicle shall be sold at public sale to the highest and best bidder for cash to satisfy the lien. Notice of the sale shall be given in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1102. Publication, required by K.S.A. 8-1102, may be made before the termination of the 60-day period for a sale thereafter. 
(Code 1983; Code 1996,  14-409) 
Sec. 36-134. - Redemption. 
    If the city is to conduct the sale: 
(1)  Any holder of a recorded lien or retained title on a motor vehicle to be sold by the city under the provisions of section 36-133 may claim and take possession thereof, upon payment of accrued charges and estimated costs of publication of the notice of sale to the police department and the deposit with the police department of sufficient assurance by surety bond or otherwise, approved by the city attorney, that the motor vehicle will be forthcoming for public sale thereof or upon claim of the rightful owner prior to the sale. The police department shall, within three days, make a report to the city treasurer and deliver the charges and costs so paid to the city treasurer, taking a receipt therefor and filing it, together with a duplicate copy of the report to the city treasurer, with the records in the city treasurer's office. The funds shall be held in a trust account until final disposition of the motor vehicle. Not less than five days before the date for sale of the motor vehicle, the police department shall notify the lienholder or retained title holder of the time and place for the sale, and the lienholder or retained title holder shall deliver such motor vehicle to the police department at or before 12:00 noon of the day before the sale. At the sale the amount paid shall be credited on the bid of the lienholder or retained title holder. If the lienholder or retained title holder is the successful bidder for the motor vehicle, the police department shall report this fact to the city treasurer and then the funds previously paid by the lienholder or retained title holder shall be relieved of the trust previously impressed and become the same as other funds received by the city for storage and costs of impounded motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is sold for a higher bid to any person other than the lienholder or retained title holder, the police department shall report this fact to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained title holder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him out of the trust account. 
(2)  And if the rightful owner of the motor vehicle claims the same before the sale by payment of the accrued charges, the police department shall immediately notify the lienholder or retained title holder in possession of the motor vehicle and the lienholder or retained title holder shall return the same to the police department within 12 hours. The police department shall report this redemption by the rightful owner to the city treasurer and the lienholder or retained title holder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him out of the trust account. 
(Code 1983; Code 1996,  14-410) 
Sec. 36-135. - Sale proceeds. 
    The proceeds of a public sale held pursuant to section 36-132 whether such sale was conducted by the city or by any other person, after payment of the towing and storage charges and costs and expenses incident to the sale, shall be deposited with the city treasurer, if the owner of the motor vehicle is absent from the sale, for credit to the trust account. The funds deposited in the trust account pursuant to this section shall remain in the account subject to the order of the person legally entitled thereto, but if no claim is made for these funds within a period of one year after the sale, the funds shall become the property of the city, be released from the trust account and be paid into the general fund as miscellaneous revenues.

(c)  Only one minimum monthly charge shall be applied where more than one meter is installed for service to a single industry or commercial business located at single or adjoining sites. The additional monthly charge shall be applied to the total average winter water use measured at all meters that supply water to a single industry or commercial at single or adjoining sites. 
(d)  The charges to the customer may be adjusted by the city manager or designee when it can be established that the customer incurred a water leak during the period used to calculate the average winter use. 
(e)  For all bills for wastewater service that become due and payable on or after January 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, a standard escalator of 2.25 percent will take effect on the existing rates. The governing body may take action, by resolution, to adjust or eliminate the escalator for that particular year.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 4046,  II, III, adopted Aug. 4, 2009, repealed former  38-367, and enacted a new  38-367 as set out herein. Former  38-367 pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 
Sec. 38-368. - Revenues. 
    All revenues collected through sewer user charges and placed in the OM&R accounts shall be used only for the purpose of meeting annual revenue requirements for OM&R. Revenues transferred from any other account to meet annual OM&R revenue requirements must be repaid the following year by adjusting user charges, if necessary. 
(Code 1996,  15-437; Ord. No. 3224,  1) 
Sec. 38-369. - Surcharge. 
(a)  Any user shall be assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer user charge, if the wastewater discharged by this user has BOD concentrations greater than 300 mg/l and/or suspended solids concentrations greater than 350 mg/l and/or any other pollutant not found or in greater concentrations than found in normal domestic wastewater. The users surcharge shall be calculated using the following formulas: 
(1)  Pounds of BOD treated/year = Average monthly BOD influent concentration at the city WWTP times average daily flow to the city WWTP in million gallons per day times 365 days/year times 8.34 pounds/gallon. 
(2)  Pounds of TSS treated/year = Average monthly TSS influent concentration at the city WWTP times average daily flow to the city WWTP in million gallons per day times 365 days/year times 8.34 pounds/gallon. 
(3)  Cost/pound to treat both BOD and TSS = Wastewater department total expenses divided by sum of pounds of BOD treated/year plus pounds of TSS treated/year. 
(4)  Proportion cost/pound to treat BOD compared cost/pound to treat TSS using 1.4/1.0 ratio. The result is the BOD surcharge rate and the TSS surcharge rate. 
(5)  Pounds of BOD excess = actual BOD concentration above 300 mg/l times monthly sewer user's flow rate in million gallons times 8.34 pounds/gallon. 
(6)  Pounds of TSS excess = actual TSS concentration above 350 mg/l times monthly sewer user's flow rate in million gallons times 8.34 pounds/gallon. 
(7)  BOD surcharge = Pounds of BOD excess times BOD surcharge rate. 
(8)  TSS surcharge = Pounds of TSS excess times TSS surcharge rate. 
(b)  It is the city's responsibility to determine the average monthly BOD and TSS concentrations existing the sewer user's system. The city will obtain samples on a weekly basis (no less than three/month) and have it analyzed by a certified testing laboratory for BOD and TSS concentrations. The results will be averaged to determine the monthly concentration that the surcharge will be based on. The city reserves the right to discard erroneous results from the monthly average. 
(c)  The BOD and TSS surcharge rates will be increased annually by 3.5 percent, beginning January 1, 2008.

SECTION 4. - COMPENSATION. 
    As further consideration for the granting of this Franchise, and in lieu of any city occupation, license, or permit fees, or revenue taxes, the Franchisee shall pay to the City during the term of this Franchise five percent (5%) of the gross cash receipts from the sale of natural gas and transportation services to all consumers within the corporate limits of the City, such payments to be made monthly for the preceding monthly period.

SECTION 6. - USE OF RIGHT-OF-WAY. 
    The use of rights-of-way under this Franchise by the Franchisee shall be subject to all rules, regulations and policies now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City in the reasonable exercise of its police power. In addition, the Franchisee shall be subject to all rules, regulations and policies now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City relating to permits, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, and other requirements on the use of the rights-of-way; provided however, that nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of or be construed as waiving the right of the Franchisee to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, in such manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law, any such rules, regulation or policy proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the City and, further provided other than the items enumerated in Section 5 herein, that such rules, regulations or policies shall not require the payment of additional fees or additional costs for the use of the rights-of-way.

SECTION 8. - IMPROVEMENTS FOR HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE. 
    If requested by the City, in order to accomplish construction and maintenance activities directly related to improvements for the health, safety and welfare of the public, the Franchisee shall promptly remove its facilities from the Public right-of-way or shall relocate or adjust its facilities within the Public right-of-way. Such relocation or adjustment shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible.

Such ordinance shall provide that the customer transporting gas through the facilities of the Franchisee shall be solely responsible for the payment of any applicable Franchise fee associated with the commodity value of the gas, but said Franchise may grant to the Franchisee the authority to collect on behalf of the City the total compensation to be made to the City by other parties using the Franchisee's facilities for distribution of transport gas. Such Franchise assessment shall be compatible with Franchisee's billing system. To the extent any transporter using the Franchisee's facilities fails to pay any amounts owed by transporters under the separate ordinance, Franchisee shall notify the City of such amount and City shall be solely responsible for collecting any sums owed. 
SECTION 10. - NATURAL GAS LIMITATIONS. 
    It is recognized that the natural gas to be delivered hereunder is to be supplied from a pipeline system transporting natural gas from distant sources of supply; and the Franchisee, by its acceptance of this Franchise as hereinafter provided, does obligate itself to furnish natural gas in such quantity and for such length of time, limited by the terms hereof, as the said sources and said pipelines are reasonably capable of supplying. 
SECTION 11. - INDEMNIFICATION. 
    Franchisee, its successors and assigns, in the construction, maintenance, and operation of its natural gas system, shall use all reasonable and proper precaution to avoid damage or injury to persons and property, and shall hold and save harmless the City from any and all damage, injury, and expense caused by the negligence of said Franchisee, its successors and assigns, or its or their agents or servants. This Section 11 is solely for the benefit of the City and the Franchisee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity. 
SECTION 12. - KCC FILING. 
    Within twenty (20) days after the passage and approval of this Ordinance, Franchisee shall file the same with the Kansas Corporation Commission.

SECTION 14. - REVIEW AND RENEGOTIATION. 
    Upon written request of either the City or the Franchisee, this Franchise may be reviewed after three (3) years from the effective date of this ordinance, and every three (3) years thereafter. Said request must be served upon the other party at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of each period set forth above, and shall state specifically the amendments desired. 
    The City and the Franchisee shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon mutually satisfactory amendments. Failure of the City and Franchisee to successfully renegotiate the materially affected provisions of this franchise under this section shall give rise to dispute resolution as follows: When the parties determine that they are at an impasse, the City and the Franchisee shall each select a representative who shall jointly select a third representative. The three representatives shall hear the positions of the City and the Franchisee and shall determine the matters in disagreement by a majority vote. Such decisions shall be presented to the City and Franchisee as the renegotiated language. Rejection of the dispute resolution by either the City or Franchisee shall give rise to the remedies provided by statute, or, at the option of the parties, the franchise shall remain in effect according to its then existing terms. 
    Amendments under this section, if any, shall be made by ordinance as prescribed by statute. Except as provided within this section the Franchise shall remain in effect according to its terms pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this subsection. This franchise shall, in all events, be subject to terms and provisions of this ordinance and the terms and provisions of K.S.A. 2002 Supp. 12-2001, and amendments thereto. Any and all ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with the terms hereof are hereby repealed or considered as having no effect. The compensation for this Franchise shall be as hereinafter set forth. 
    Upon written request of either the City or the Franchisee, the Franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time upon any of the following events: 
a)  Change in federal, state, or local law, regulation, or order which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City; or Franchisee, including, but not limited to, the scope of the grant to the Franchisee or the compensation to be received by the City. 
b)  Change in the structure or operation of the natural gas industry, which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or Franchisee, including, but not limited to, the scope of the grant to the Franchisee or the compensation to be received by the City. 
c)  Any other material and unintended change or shift in the economic benefit to the City or the Franchisee relied upon and anticipated upon entering into this Franchise. 
    The compensation provision of this Franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy through pipelines, and use the public rights of way or public property of the City without paying a Franchise fee or other payment substantially equivalent to the Franchise fee established herein, which results in a material and unfair disadvantage to the Franchisee. The use of right of provision of this Franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy through pipelines which use the public rights of way or public property of the City, and do not have requirements on the use of the public ways substantially equivalent to the requirements of this Franchise, which results in a material and unfair disadvantage to the Franchisee. Upon any such event, the City shall have up to ninety (90) days after written request of the Franchisee to restore competitive neutrality. Following notice to the City, Franchisee may suspend collection and payment of the Franchise fee to the City for the affected customers until the City resolves the competitive disadvantage. After the last above referred ninety (90) days period expires without resolution of the competitive disadvantage, the Franchisee shall have no liability to the City for any uncollected Franchise fees suspended as provided in the subsection. 
SECTION 15. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. 
    The Franchise is granted pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 12-2001 and amendments thereto. 
SECTION 16. - PUBLICATION EXPENSE. 
    All expenses of publishing this Ordinance shall be paid by the Franchisee. 
SECTION 17. - CONFLICTS. 
    Any and all ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with the terms hereof are hereby repealed or considered as having no effect as of the first cycle of the monthly billing cycle as referenced in Section 21 of this ordinance. 
SECTION 18. - SEVERABILITY. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Ordinance is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof. 
SECTION 19. - STATE REGULATIONS. 
    Should the Kansas Corporation Commission take any action with respect to this Franchise ordinance and any amendment thereto that precludes Franchisee from recovering from its customers any costs or fees provided for hereunder, the parties hereto shall renegotiate this ordinance in accordance with the Commission's ruling. 
SECTION 20. - ENTIRE AGREEMENT. 
    This Ordinance, when accepted as above provided, shall constitute the entire agreement between the City and the Franchisee relating to this Franchise and the same shall supercede and cancel any prior understandings, agreements, or representations regarding the subject matter hereof, or involved in negotiations pertaining thereto, whether oral or written, shall be binding upon the parties, including their successors and assigns, and shall not be amended or further obligations imposed without mutual consent of the parties hereto. 
SECTION 21. - EFFECTIVE DATE.

(b)  Said compensation shall be paid monthly and shall be due not later than thirty (30) days after the end of the remittal period. For purposes of this section, the term "remittal period" shall mean a period of one (1) month of gross receipts which shall be used in determining the amount of compensation due to the City not later than thirty (30) days after the end of said one (1) month period.

This section shall not be construed to create or grant to any third person any rights, contractual or otherwise.
