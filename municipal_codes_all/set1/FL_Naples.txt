PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Naples, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1994 Code, as supplemented through June 14, 2006, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1994 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein, as well as sections of the 1957 Code and the 1990 Comprehensive Development Code. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Robert D. Pritt, City Attorney, and Ms. Patricia Rambosk, Legal Coordinator, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the City of Naples Airport Authority Act, Laws of Fla. ch. 69-1326. The act, which became a law without the governor's approval, was filed in the office of the secretary of state July 3, 1969. Ord. No. 2876, §§ 1, 2, adopted Jan. 18, 1978, amended § 4(o) of Laws of Fla. ch. 69-1326, and provided that this act be constituted an ordinance of the city. However, Ord. No. 3152, enacted Dec. 20, 1978, repealed Ord. No. 2876 with the intent of ratifying and confirming the original provisions of Laws of Fla. ch. 69-1326. Therefore, this article has been restored to appear as it read prior to amendment by Ord. No. 2876. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of capitalization, headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

Sec. 1. - [Title.] 
    This act shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Naples Airport Authority Act." 
Sec. 2. - [Definitions.] 
    As used in this act the following words and terms shall have the following meanings unless the context shall indicate another or different meaning or intent. 
(a)  [ Airport facilities. ] The term "airport facilities" shall mean the airport facilities at the Naples Municipal Airport, located on the following described premises: 
North one-half of Section 2, Township 50 South, Range 25 East and the South one-half of Section 35, Township 49 South, Range 25 East, less right-of-way; 
including, but not limited to, landing fields, hangars, shops, terminals, buildings and all other facilities necessary or desirable for the landing, taking off, operating, servicing, repairing and parking of aircraft, and the unloading and handling of passengers, mail, express and freight, together with all necessary appurtenances and equipment and all properties, rights, easements and franchises relating thereto, including all lands and buildings located at the Naples airport which may be used for any industrial, commercial or business purposes or other uses which the authority may determine. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give the airport authority the right to control zoning at the airport facilities, said right being specifically reserved to the City of Naples. "Airport facilities" shall also include any other airport in Collier County which the airport authority has contracted to operate. 
(b)  [ Authority. ] The word "authority" shall mean the authority created by this act, or, if such authority shall be abolished, the board, body or commission succeeding to the principal functions thereof or to whom the powers given by this act to the authority shall be given by law. 
(c)  [ Cost. ] The word "cost" shall mean and include the cost of acquiring or constructing airport facilities, the cost of improvements, the cost of all rights, easements and franchises acquired, the cost of all machinery and equipment, financing charges, interest prior to and during construction and after completion of construction, cost of engineering and legal services, plans, specifications, surveys, estimates of cost and of revenues, other expenses necessary or incident to the determining of the feasibility or practicability of any such acquisition, construction or improvement, administrative expenses, and such other expenses, including reasonable provision for working capital, as may be necessary or incident to the financing herein authorized, to the construction and improvement of airport facilities and the placing of the same in operation by the authority. Any obligation or expense incurred by the authority prior to the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this act in connection with the acquisition or construction of the airport facilities or any improvement thereof may be regarded as a part of such cost. 
(d)  [ Improvements. ] The word "improvements" shall mean such repairs, replacements, additions, extensions and betterments of and to the airport facilities as are deemed necessary to place or to maintain such facilities in proper condition for the safe, efficient and economic operation thereof. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 79-516, § 1; Laws of Fla. ch. 90-468, § 1) 
Sec. 3. - [City of Naples airport authority.] 
    [ Created. ] There is hereby created a body politic and corporate to be known as the City of Naples airport authority for the purpose of operating and maintaining the airport facilities at the City of Naples municipal airport, located in Collier County, Florida, or any other airport in Collier County which the airport authority may contract to operate. The authority is hereby constituted a public instrumentality and the exercise by the authority of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be the performance of essential governmental functions. 
    [ Resolution determining need for authority to function. ] Said authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the city council of the City of Naples by proper resolution, shall declare that there is need for the authority to function. The determination as to whether there is such need for the authority to function may be made by the city council on its own motion. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the city council declaring the need for the authority. A copy of such resolution duly certified by the clerk shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding. 
    [ Commissioners. ] The city council by an affirmative vote of four (4) members of the council shall appoint five (5) persons as commissioners of the authority created for the city. Three (3) of the commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one (1), two (2) and three (3) years, respectively; and the remaining two (2) of such commissioners shall be designated to serve for terms of four (4) years each, from the date of their appointment. Thereafter commissioners shall be appointed as aforesaid for a term of office of four (4) years except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term. No commissioner of the authority may be an officer or employee of the city. A commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner. A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services, but he shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties. 
    [ Meetings; quorum; officers; employees; legal services. ] All meetings of the authority shall be public meetings and the powers of the authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof in office from time to time. Three (3) commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number. The mayor with the concurrence of the city council shall designate which of the commissioners appointed shall be the first chairman, but when the office of the chairman of the authority thereafter becomes vacant, the authority shall select a chairman from among its commissioners. The authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice-chairman, and it may employ a secretary (who shall be executive director), technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. For such legal services as it may require, the authority may call upon the chief law officer of the city or may employ its own counsel and legal staff. The authority may delegate to one (1) or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper. 
    [ Removal of commissioner. ] For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a commissioner of the authority may be removed by an affirmative vote of five (5) members of the city council but a commissioner shall be removed only after he shall have been given a copy of the charges at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing thereon and had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. In the event of the removal of any commissioner, a record of the proceedings, together with the charges and findings thereon, shall be filed in the office of the clerk. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 79-516, § 2; Laws of Fla. ch. 90-468, § 2)

With regard to the issuance of any obligations in excess of two million dollars, the city council of the City of Naples shall act in an advisory capacity.

(o)  To exercise and perform all of the powers and prerogatives conferred upon "political subdivisions" by F.S. ch. 333, with respect to the adoption, promulgation and enforcement of airport zoning regulations under the provision of said F.S. ch. 333. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 75-451, § 1; Laws of Fla. ch. 79-516, § 3; Laws of Fla. ch. 90-468, § 3) 
Sec. 5. - [Bonds.] 
    The authority is hereby authorized to issue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying the cost of improving, extending, enlarging or equipping the airport facilities. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates and shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form and the manner of the execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this act or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this act, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of this state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine to be for the best interests of the authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received more than at an acceptable rate to the airport authority, computed with relation to the absolute maturity or maturities of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity. 
    The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been authorized and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement securing such bonds, if the proceeds of such bonds, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. 
    The resolution providing for the issuance of bonds, and any trust agreement securing such bonds, may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional bonds as the authority may deem proper, and such additional bonds shall be issued under such restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such resolution or trust agreement. 
    Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or destroyed or lost. 
    Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this act without obtaining the consent of any political subdivision and without any other proceeding or the happening of other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this act. 
Sec. 6. - [Fixing of rates, fees and charges for use of services furnished by airport facilities.] 
    The authority is hereby authorized to fix and revise from time to time rates, fees and other charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by any airport facilities operated by the authority. Such rates, fees and charges shall be fixed and revised so that the revenues of the authority, together with any other available funds, will be sufficient at all times (a) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the airport facilities operated by the authority, including reserves for such purposes, and (b) to pay the principal of and the interest on all bonds issued by the authority under the provisions of this act as the same shall become due and payable and to provide reserves therefor. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the authority may enter into contracts relating to the use of or for the services furnished or to be furnished by the airport facilities. 
Sec. 7. - [Trust agreements; pledge of revenues, etc.] 
    In the discretion of the authority, each or any issue of bonds may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or such trust agreement may pledge the revenues to be received from any airport facilities of the authority but shall not convey or mortgage any of such facilities, and may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the maintenance, repair, operation, insurance and improvement of such facilities, the fixing and revising of rates, fees and charges and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and for the employment of consulting engineers in connection with such improvement or operation. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such resolution or trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, if any, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. Such resolution or trust agreement may contain such other provisions in addition to the foregoing as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. The authority may provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of any airport facilities to such officer, board or depository as it may designate for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such resolution or trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of operation. 
    All pledges of revenues under the provisions of this act shall be valid and binding from the time when such pledges are made. All such revenues so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledges without any physical delivery thereof or further action, and the lien of such pledges shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise, against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. 
Sec. 8. - [Suits by bondholder or trustee under trust agreement.] 
    Any holder of bonds issued under the provisions of this act or of any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under any trust agreement, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or such trust agreement, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceeding, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust agreement, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust agreement to be performed by the authority or by any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of rates, fees and charges for the use of or for the services and facilities furnished by the airport facilities. 
Sec. 9. - [Refunding bonds.] 
    The authority is hereby authorized to issue from time to time refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds of the authority then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption of such bonds. The authority is further authorized to issue from time to time bonds of the authority for the combined purpose of (a) refunding any bonds of the authority then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption of such bonds, and (b) paying all or any part of the cost of acquiring or constructing any additional airport facilities or of any improvements. The issuance of such bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights and remedies of the holders thereof, and the rights, powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the authority with respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
Sec. 10. - [Act as additional and alternative method.] 
    This act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative methods for the doing of the things authorized hereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of or as repealing any powers now existing under any other law, whether general, special or local; provided, however, that the issuance of bonds or refunding bonds under the provisions of this act need not comply with the requirements of any other laws applicable to the issuance of bonds. 
Sec. 11. - [Inconsistent laws or ordinances.] 
    All other general, special or local laws or ordinances or parts thereof inconsistent herewith, specifically including the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act, F.S. § 166.021, and any amendments thereto, are hereby declared to be inapplicable to the provisions of this act. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 79-516, § 4) 
Sec. 12. - [Severability of provisions of act.] 
    The provisions of this act are severable and if any of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions. 
Sec. 13. - [Levy of taxes on airport facility or income prohibited.] 
    As airport facilities are essential to the economic welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Naples and Collier County and will promote the economic, commercial, industrial and residential development of said city and county, and as the exercise of the powers conferred by this act to effect such purposes constitutes the performance of essential public functions and as such airport facilities acquired or constructed under the provisions of this act will constitute public property used for public purposes, no taxes or assessments shall be levied upon such airport facilities or upon the income therefrom, and any bonds issued under the provisions of this act, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation within the state. 
Sec. 14. - [County and city police powers.] 
    The City of Naples and Collier County shall have full police powers throughout the territory comprising the lands of the airport and the airspace thereover, and each may appoint guards or police to assist in the enforcement of such rules, regulations and ordinances as it may adopt pursuant to the authority of this act. 
Sec. 15. - [Rules and regulations; enforcement; jurisdiction of municipal court.] 
    Rules and regulations enacted and adopted by the City of Naples Airport Authority shall be enforced as are city ordinances. Violation thereof shall be a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as set out in section 1.4 of the Charter of the City of Naples, Florida. The [county court] is hereby vested with and granted jurisdiction for the trial of all offenders against any ordinance, rule or regulation which the said city shall adopt and enact pursuant to the authority of this act, and the process of said court shall be effective throughout the territory comprising the lands of the airport and the airspace thereover. 
Editor's note- The reference to municipal court has been deleted and county court has been inserted as municipal courts were abolished, offenses are tried in county courts. 
Sec. 16. - [Liberal construction of act.] 
    The provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes thereof. 
Sec. 17. - Airport facilities operated by the City of Naples Airport Authority; lien for fuel, landing and other fees. 
(1)  The City of Naples Airport Authority shall have a lien upon all aircraft landing upon any airport owned or operated by it for all charges for fuel, landing fees and other fees and charges for the use of the facilities of such airport by any such aircraft, when payment of such charges and fees is not made immediately upon demand therefor to the operator or owner of the aircraft by a duly authorized employee of the airport authority. The lien for the full amount of the charges and fees due to the airport authority attaches to any aircraft owned or operated by the person owing such charges and fees. Such lien may be enforced as provided by law for the enforcement of warehousemen's liens in this state. 
(2)  It is unlawful for any person to remove or attempt to remove any such aircraft from such airport after notice of the lien has been served upon the owner or operator thereof or after posting of such notice upon such aircraft. Any person who removes or attempts to remove any such aircraft from such airport after service or posting of the notice of lien as herein provided, and before payment of the amount due to the airport authority for landing fees and charges incurred by such aircraft, shall be guilty of a criminal offense and misdemeanor within the meaning of F.S. § 775.08 and shall be punished as provided by law.

Cross reference- Fire prevention and protection, ch. 24; parks and recreation, ch. 28. 

Sec. 2-841. - Statutory authority; applicability. 
(a)  The city council has authority to adopt this division through the Charter and through home rule powers pursuant to article VIII of the state constitution and F.S. chs. 163 and 166. 
(b)  Increasing the capacity of fire, police, and parks and recreation, facilities, in accordance with the comprehensive plan, is a recognized proprietary power of the city through F.S. § 166.021, and F.S 163.31801 and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(c)  Planning, through the comprehensive planning process, for the necessary expansion of new fire, police, and parks and recreation, and facilities created by new land development activity generating need is a responsibility of the city through F.S. § 163.3161 et seq., and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(d)  This division shall apply to the incorporated area of the city. 
(Code 1957, § 21A-31; Code 1994, § 118-181; Ord. No. 08-11954, § 1, 2-20-2008) 
Sec. 2-842. - Intent and purpose of division. 
(a)  The city council has determined and recognized that the growth rate which the city is experiencing will necessitate extensive facilities improvements and make it necessary to regulate new development in order to maintain fire, police, parks and recreation, and general government facilities at an acceptable level of service so as to maintain quality of life in the city. In order to finance the necessary new capital improvements and to purchase necessary equipment, several combined financing methods will be necessary, one of which will require new developments to pay a fire, police, and parks and recreation capital facility fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new fire, police, and parks and recreation facilities. 
(b)  Providing fire, police, and parks and recreation, and related facilities is a recognized proprietary power of the city through F.S. § 166.021, and is in the best interests of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(c)  Implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay a fire, police, and parks and recreation, capital facility fee; i.e., impact fee, that does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new fire, police, and parks and recreation facilities created by the new land development activity is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the comprehensive plan, as amended, and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(d)  The purpose of this division is to continue to enable the city to allow new development in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan and to regulate new development activity generating fire, police, parks and recreation, and general government activities so as to require it to share in the burdens of growth by paying its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of fire, police, and parks and recreation facilities improvements. Thus, new growth will help pay for itself, and the existing residents of the city will not have the full financial burden of providing increased fire, police, and parks and recreation capacity at the outset. 
(e)  It is the purpose of this division to establish a system to assist in providing increased capacity for the fire, police, and parks and recreation operations to accommodate the increased demand new development will have on the existing operations. New land development activity will be required to pay a fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated costs of new fire, police and parks and recreation facilities and other facilities than its presence necessitates. 
(f)  The city council hereby calculates the impact fee based on the most recent and localized data, which is contained in the impact fee rate study, entitled "Impact Fees" as prepared by Tischler Bise and dated January 25, 2008 and any amendments, updates, or supplements thereto prior to adoption of this ordinance, including without limitation the assumptions, conclusions and findings in such study. A copy of the study will be kept on file in the office of the city clerk.

Excluded from this provision are those organizations and their officers who, when acting in their official capacity, enter into or negotiate a collective bargaining contract with the city. Nor shall a public officer or employee have or hold any employment or contractual relationship that will create a continuing or frequently recurring conflict between the officer's or employee's private interests and the performance of the officer's or employee's public duties or that would impede the full and faithful discharge of the officer's or employee's public duties. 
(2)  While serving as a public officer or employee, no public officer or employee shall personally represent another person, group, or business entity before the governmental body.

Sec. 16-51. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accessory structures (type I) are nonhabitable structures that normally have a roof and a measurable floor area, or ground surface area, e.g. gazebos, sheds, chickees, boathouses, swimming pools, etc. 
    Accessory structures (type II) are nonhabitable structures that usually do not have a roof and a measurable floor area, e.g. fences, signs, driveways, sidewalks, exterior screen walls, etc. 
    Commercial means all other occupiable areas that are not classified as residential, including multifamily residential. 
    Detention facility is a facility used to temporarily store stormwater runoff and rainfall that recovers its storage volume by the controlled release of water through designed drawdown structures and mechanisms (see "retention facility" for contrast.) 
    Gross square footage is the total square footage of the structure measured to the outside of the exterior walls, or column lines where there are no walls. This is the same as the building footprint. Where the structure contains multiple floors (stories), the gross square footage is calculated to include the area of all floors (stories). 
    Impact fees are charges assessed and collected on newly developed property by local governments. The intent of the fee is to recover the cost incurred by providing public amenities required for the new development. 
    Impermeability is the relative inability of a material to allow the flow of water to pass through the material, typically associated with solid surfaces that prohibit rainfall or both rainfall and rainfall runoff from entering and passing through the material. 
    Impervious means impenetrable or impermeable by water. 
    Impervious area means the percentage of the lot land area covered by impervious surfaces such as buildings or structures, swimming pools, decks, lanais, patios, driveways, and also includes any surface covered by concrete, bricks, blocks, flagstones, paving, sealant, or any other impermeable material. Standard engineering coefficients of permeability shall be used for partially pervious materials. 
    Occupiable areas are, for the purpose of this article, defined as any enclosed space that can be occupied by humans. This would include every square foot of floor area under the same roof of residential and commercial buildings computed to the outside of the exterior walls, or column line for areas without exterior walls, of the structure. In a residential structure this would include attached garages, detached garages, carports, storage rooms, etc. 
    Paved areas are any exterior areas covered with human-made or natural materials to provide a walking and/or vehicle traversing surface as opposed to real grass or other vegetation. Materials could include but shall not necessarily be limited to concrete, asphalt, brick, stone, and astro-turf type surfaces. 
    Penalty fees are additional fees imposed upon the project for failure to comply with certain requirements of this article. 
    Permit fees means monies collected for the processing of permits and operation of the building and zoning division. 
    Plan review fees are fees collected at the time an application for a permit is submitted to the building and zoning division to cover the cost of reviewing the plans and specifications for code compliance. This fee will be charged for all construction projects involving habitable structures and accessory structures where plans have to be submitted. 
    Residential means one- or two-family units of occupiable areas. 
    Retention facility is a facility used to store stormwater runoff and rainfall that recovers its storage volume only when the water evaporates, transpirates, or percolates from the facility. 
    Re-development is any construction activity on a site where the aggregate of actions and/or costs to reconstruct, modify, alter, or improve the property, whether in one phase or in multiple phases, are anticipated to do any of the following: (1) increase the appraised value of the property more than 50 percent of its current appraised value: (2) replaces the existing building or reconstructs more than 50 percent of the area under existing roof; (3) raises more than 50 percent of the existing finished floor; or (4) modifies the existing site grading sufficiently to warrant concern that the new activities could create problems for offsite or adjacent property. 
    Surcharge fees are additional fees imposed by some level of government to be used for some specific purpose. 
    Temporary use permits are permits issued for special activities or events that do not meet local zoning requirements. These permits are issued for a specific time period determined by the building official based on the applicant's request.

DIVISION 3. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 16-81. - Generally. 
(a)  Definition. For purposes of this section, a variance shall be deemed to be a relaxation of the provisions of the Florida Building Code, the property maintenance code or the flood insurance criteria as set forth in article IV of this chapter, where such variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to special conditions and circumstances peculiar to the property, a literal enforcement of the provisions of such codes and the flood insurance criteria would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. 
(b)  Standards for approval; procedure. A variance shall not be granted unless and until: 
(1)  A written petition is submitted to the board of appeals demonstrating that special conditions and circumstances exist that justify the granting of the requested variance, that literal enforcement of the provisions of such codes or the flood insurance criteria would deprive the petitioner of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties, that granting the variance will not confer on the petitioner any special privilege that is denied to others, that literal enforcement of the provisions of such codes or the flood insurance criteria will work undue and unnecessary hardship on the petitioner, and that granting the variance will, for reasons stated in the petition, be in the public interest. 
(2)  Public notice shall be given and a public hearing held as required in chapter 2, article II, division 3. 
(3)  The board of appeals shall make findings as required by subsection (a)(2) of this section and shall further find that the variance is the minimum variance necessary to accomplish the intent and purpose of such codes and the flood insurance criteria as set forth in article IV of this chapter. 
(4)  The board of appeals shall further make a finding that granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the health of the neighborhood or the occupants of the structure, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
    In granting a variance, the board may attach reasonable conditions and safeguards in conformity with such codes and article IV of this chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the Florida Building Code, the property maintenance code or article IV of this chapter. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 3-85; Code 1994, § 86-205(a); Ord. No. 94-7210, § 1, 6-15-1994; Ord. No. 95-7451, §§ 1, 2, 6-7-1995; Ord. No. 95-7594, § 6, 12-20-1995; Ord. No. 97-8046, § 1, 8-20-1997; Ord. No. 99-8454, § 3, 1-20-1999; Ord. No. 99-8515, § 3, 4-7-1999) 
Sec. 16-82. - Variances and appeals to floodplain management regulations. 
(a)  Generally. The board of appeals shall hear and decide requests for appeals and requests for variances from the strict application of article IV of this chapter. Pursuant to section F.S. § 553.73(5), the board of appeals shall also hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the strict application of the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code. The article does not apply to Section 3109 of the Florida Building Code, Building. General requirements for variances to floodplain management regulations are as follows: 
(1)  Historic buildings. A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 12 Historic Buildings, upon determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(2)  Restrictions in floodways. A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in subsection 16-148(3). 
(3)  Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in article IV of this chapter, provided the variance meets the requirements of subsection 16-82(a)(2) of this chapter, is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
(4)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(b)  Method of approval. The board of appeals, as established in chapter 2, article II, division 3, shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the administration and enforcement of this article. 
(c)  Standards for approval. 
(1)  In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in article IV of this chapter, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this section, including without limitation: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents to flood damage and the effects of such damage on current and future owners; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed development that is subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(2)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (c)(1) of this section and the purposes of article IV of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of article IV of this chapter. 
(3)  Conditions for variances are as follows: Variances shall only be issued upon all of the following: 
a.  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site render any provision of article IV of this chapter or the elevation standards of the Florida Building Code inappropriate; 
b.  Determination by the board of appeals that: 
1.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford relief. 
2.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship. Exceptional hardship means the hardship associated with the land that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The community requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be placed upon an instrument that will be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
d.  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, receipt and submission of a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced flood elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

Sec. 16-115. - Stormwater construction standards. 
(a)  Any new development, redevelopment or substantial improvement of platted properties within the City of Naples shall be reviewed to assure compliance with the following minimum stormwater design criteria: 
LAND USE CONVEYANCE/
QUANTITY
(GOAL "A")STORAGE/
QUALITY
(GOAL "B") Single-Family (A) (B) Multi-Family (A) (B) Non-Residential/ 
Mixed Use (A) (B)  
TECHNICAL CRITERIA NOTES: 
(A)  Unless otherwise specified by previous South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) permits or district criteria, a storm event of a one-hour duration and five-year return frequency shall be used in computing the minimum off-site discharge rates from private properties to the city's stormwater system. The stormwater conveyance system should be designed sufficiently so that the conveyance shall pass the design flow while ensuring that the backwater head does not exceed the proposed berms, walls or other containment systems in a 25-year - 24-hour storm event. The side lot swales and other emergency conveyance facilities may be designed to pass the water forward to the public right-of-way. 
(B)  Unless otherwise specified by previous South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) permits or district criteria, water quality standards shall be determined based upon selecting the most appropriate pollutant removal presumption to the corresponding BMP technique. The BMP guidelines used must meet a presumed pollutant removal of 85 percent Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP). BMPs that do not effectively remove TN and TP such as "dry detention" will be discouraged. Innovative approaches and LID techniques that reduce percent impervious are encouraged. Although reductions in storage volume may be given to BMPs that use "retention" and exfiltration, under no circumstances will the design storage volume be allowed to be less than one-half inch of retention storage volume nor less than 1.25 inch of dry detention storage volume (based on total site area). The following special conditions shall apply in meeting the above standards: a) on single-family lots no more than one-half inch of detention or retention shall be stored underground in vaults, exfiltration pipes, or french drains; b) rainfall runoff from roof drains can be disregarded from the water quality calculations (GOAL "B") but not from the conveyance calculations (GOAL "A") since roof water is not a major source of pollutant concern but it is a major concern for release into the public system for flooding considerations. Directly connected impervious area (DCIA) is discouraged for purposes of GOAL "A"; c) retention systems shall be designed and located no less than 18 inches above the wet season water table; exfiltration and pervious pavement shall be designed to be a minimum of 24 inches above the wet season water table; d) where special filtering materials are utilized, where swimming pools and patio areas are designed for storage or where special retention provisions are provided consistent with SFWMD criteria or consistent with Chapter 62 of the Florida Administrative Code, the building official may credit such areas in the computation of total on-site storage. 
(b)  All implementation of stormwater improvements shall conform to the above standards and shall include compliance with the following special criteria: 
(1)  Plans and specifications signed and sealed by an appropriate design professional shall be submitted for review and approval prior to the issuance of city permits. Upon completion of the construction of stormwater improvements and prior to receiving a certification of occupancy or completion, a certification with record documents shall be submitted by the design professional stating that the work has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the plans and specifications. 
(2)  Establishment, re-establishment or maintenance of swales within the abutting city street right-of-way in accordance with the city's right-of-way standards handbook. 
(3)  Prohibition of stormwater discharge into a platted alley unless a drainage conveyance system exists within the alley with sufficient surplus capacity to handle the quantity of runoff proposed for discharge to the alley. 
(4)  Roof gutters are required as an erosion control technique that also follows the philosophy of reducing DCIA and shall be installed on all buildings. However, in special cases, where the side yard widths are greater than ten feet, the building official may allow an exemption as long as the roof directs less than 25 percent of the roof runoff to a side yard area, and erosion control is adequately addressed. 
(5)  Streets, driveways and sidewalks shall be designed to minimize potential for increasing the runoff from private property to the city's stormwater system. 
(6)  The property owner shall maintain the stormwater system in accordance with the stormwater plan certified at the time of issuance of a certification of occupancy. The building official reserves the right to reject any BMP or innovative technique proposed to meet the goals of the ordinance if the applicant does not provide adequate assurances through a maintenance plan that the system will be effectively maintained in perpetuity. 
(c)  The environmental protection of downstream water bodies is vital to this ordinance as part of GOAL "A". In rare instances where an existing property has elevations that will not grade back into the required stormwater master system, then as a minimum, the city requires some form of pretreatment before discharge to the canal, lake, bay or other water body. Innovative BMPs shall be employed to accomplish this including (but not limited to): interceptor swales, containment berms, rain gardens and interconnection into the seawall rock drain system.

Sec. 16-141. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Florida has authorized and delegated in F.S. ch. 166, the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Naples does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
( Ord. No. 12-13139, § 3, 6-13-2012 ) 
Sec. 16-142. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Naples are subject to periodic inundation from intense rain storms and tropical cyclone storm surge, which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
( Ord. No. 12-13139, § 3, 6-13-2012 ) 
Sec. 16-143. - General. 
(1)  These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Code of the City of Naples. 
(2)  The provisions of this article shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(3)  The purposes of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard and to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(b)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public money for flood control projects; 
(c)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, roadways, and bridges and culverts located in floodplains; 
(f)  Maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; and 
(g)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(h)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; and 
(i)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(4)  This article is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code.

(1)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(2)  The collapse or subsidence of land along a shore of a lake or other body of water as the result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (1) of this definition. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of the community, issued by FEMA, which delineates both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The study contains an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and other flood-related erosion hazards. The study may also contain flood profiles, as well as the FIRM and other related data and information. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodplain administrator means the person in a position designated by the city manager responsible for the administration, implementation and enforcement of this article. 
    Floodplain development permit or approval means an official document or certificate issued by the city, or other evidence of approval or concurrence, which authorizes performance of specific development activities that are located in flood hazard areas and that are determined to be compliant with this article. 
    Florida Building Code has the same meaning as in article III of this chapter. 
    Freeboard means the additional height, usually expressed as a factor of safety in feet, above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for many unknown factors, such as wave action, blockage of bridge or culvert openings, and hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed, which could contribute to flood heights greater than the heights calculated for a selected frequency flood and floodway conditions. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood hazard area requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 11 Historic Buildings. 
    Letters of map change (LOMC) means an official determination issued by FEMA that amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study. Letters of map change include: 
(1)  Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means an amendment to the currently effective FIRM that establishes that a property is not located in a specific flood hazard area. A LOMA is issued only by FEMA. 
(2)  Letter of map revision (LOMR) means an official amendment to the currently effective FIRM. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and/or elevations. 
(3)  Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) means a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer within the special flood hazard area. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
(4)  Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) means a formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after the completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the Florida Building Code, ASCE 24. 
    Mangrove stand means an assemblage of mangrove trees which are mostly low trees noted for a copious development of interlacing adventitious roots above ground and which contain one or more of the following species: Black mangrove (Avicennia Nitida); red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle); white mangrove (Languncularia Racemosa); and buttonwood (Conocarpus Erecta). 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is eight feet or more in width and greater than 400 square feet, and which is built on a permanent, integral chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term does not include a "recreational vehicle" or "park trailer". 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel, or contiguous parcels, of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value (of the structure) means the building value, which is the property value excluding the land value and that of the detached accessory structures and other improvements on site as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by an independent certified appraisal (other than a limited or curbside appraisal, or one based on income approach), actual cash value (replacement cost depreciated for age and quality of construction of building), within six months of permit submittal, or the current Collier County Property Appraiser's assessment plus 20 percent. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29) means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. NGVD 29 was the observed heights of local mean sea level at 26 tide gauges and by the set of elevations of all benchmarks resulting from the adjustment. Current mapping uses North American Vertical Datum (NAVD 88), or converts NGVD 29 to NAVD 88. 
    New construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after January 1, 1975. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after January 1, 1975. 
    Non-conversion agreement means a document required by this article whereby the property owner agrees to not modify a newly constructed enclosed area to make it more susceptible to flood damage, in a format as to be filed with the deed and other property records. 
    North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. NAVD is the only official civilian vertical datum for the continental United States. To convert NAVD 88 to NGVD 29, add 1.3 feet to the NAVD value. 
    Park trailer means a transportable unit which has a body width not to exceed 14 feet and which is built on a single chassis and is designed to provide seasonal or temporary living quarters when connected to utilities necessary for operation of installed fixtures and appliances. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river, including tributaries, stream, or brook. 
    Sand dunes or dunes means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach. It has the same meaning as in state regulations. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) see area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a one-year period, in which the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. For each building or structure, the one-year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this article. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any repair or improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State of Florida or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official prior to the application for permit for improvement, and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, or the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise not be permitted by this article or the Florida Building Code. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    Zone X means either (1) an area determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain or, (2) an area of the 500-year flood or 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with drainage areas less than one square mile. For purposes of this article, the flood elevation in Zone X shall be equivalent to 18 inches above the elevation of the average crown of the adjacent roads abutting the property. 
( Ord. No. 12-13139, § 3, 6-13-2012 ) 
Sec. 16-145. - Applicability 
(1)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas, including special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Naples. 
(2)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Collier County, Florida and Incorporated Areas, with an effective date of November 17, 2005, and a revision date of May 16, 2012, with the accompanying maps and other supporting data, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The FIS and accompanying maps are on file at the office of the City Clerk located at City Hall, 735 8th Street South, Naples, FL 34102. 
(3)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 16-148 of this article the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
(a)  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as a flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this article and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(b)  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as a special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(4)  Other laws. The provisions of this article shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However: 
a.  It is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances, or stormwater management regulations. 
b.  This article shall not impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. 
c.  Where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(6)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: 
a.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
b.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
c.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State of Florida Statutes. 
(7)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring the city to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this article. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Naples or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(8)  Violations and penalties. 
(a)  Any development that is not within the scope of the Florida Building Code but that is regulated by this article that is performed without an issued permit, that is in conflict with an issued permit, or that does not fully comply with this article, shall be deemed a violation of this article. A building or structure without the documentation of elevation of the lowest floor, other required design certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article or the Florida Building Code is presumed to be a violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(b)  For development that is not within the scope of the Florida Building Code but that is regulated by this article and that is determined to be a violation, the floodplain administrator is authorized to serve notices of violation or stop work orders to owners of the property involved, to the owner's agent, or to the person or persons performing the work. 
(c)  Any person who shall continue any work after having been served with a notice of violation or a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove or remedy a violation or unsafe condition, shall be subject to penalties as set forth in Article III of this Chapter and section 1-15 of this Code. 
(9)  Variances. Refer to article II, section 16-82 of this Code for variance requirements. 
( Ord. No. 12-13139, § 3, 6-13-2012 ) 
Sec. 16-146. - Duties and powers of the floodplain administrator. 
(1)  Designation. The city manager shall designate a person as the floodplain administrator. 
(2)  General. The floodplain administrator shall have the authority to render interpretations of this article consistent with the intent and purpose of this article and may establish policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions.

h.  Coordinate with and provide comments to the building official to assure that applications for building permits for buildings and structures in flood hazard areas comply with the requirements of this article. 
(4)  Determinations for existing buildings and structures. For applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures, including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures, the floodplain administrator, in coordination with the building official, shall: 
a.  Estimate the market value, or require the applicant to obtain an appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of the building or structure before the start of construction on the proposed work; in the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are made; 
b.  Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or structure; the determination requires evaluation of previously issued permits for improvements and repairs as specified in the definition of substantial improvement; and 
c.  Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance with the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code and this article is required. 
(5)  Modifications of the strict application of the requirements of the Florida Building Code.

c.  Require applicants who submit hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses to support permit applications to submit to FEMA the data and information necessary to maintain the flood insurance rate maps if the analyses propose to change base flood elevations, flood hazard boundaries, or floodway designations; such submissions shall be made within six months of such data becoming available; 
d.  Review required design certifications and documentation of elevations specified by this article and the Florida Building Code to determine that such certifications and documentations are complete; 
e.  Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency when the corporate boundaries of the City of Naples are modified; and 
f.  Advise applicants for new buildings and structures, including substantial improvements, that are located in any unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources System established by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348) and the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-591) that federal flood insurance is not available on such construction; areas subject to this limitation are identified on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as "Coastal Barrier Resource System Areas" and "Otherwise Protected Areas." 
(9)  Floodplain management records. Regardless of any limitation on the period required for retention of public records, the floodplain administrator shall maintain and permanently keep and make available for public inspection all records that are necessary for the administration of this article and the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, including flood insurance rate maps; letters of change; records of issuance of permits and denial of permits; determinations of whether proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; required design certifications and documentation of elevations specified by the Florida Building Code and this article; notifications to adjacent communities, FEMA, and the state related to alterations of watercourses; assurances that the flood carrying capacity of altered watercourses will be maintained; documentation related to appeals and variances, including justification for issuance or denial; and records of enforcement actions taken pursuant to this article and the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code. These records shall be available for public inspection at the City of Naples Building Department, 295 Riverside Circle, Naples, Florida 34102. 
( Ord. No. 12-13139, § 3, 6-13-2012 ) 
Sec. 16-147. - Permits. 
(1)  Permits required. Any owner or owner's authorized agent (hereinafter "applicant") who intends to undertake any development activity within the scope of this article, including buildings, structures and facilities exempt from the Florida Building Code, which is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area shall first make application to the floodplain administrator, and the building official if applicable, and shall obtain the required permit(s) and approval(s).

If any such person shall fail to appear and turn off an alarm within one hour after being notified by the police department, the owner or manager of the premises shall be charged a fee as set forth in appendix A to this Code for each such occurrence. 
(Code 1957, § 15-32; Code 1994, § 34-38; Ord. No. 10-12812, § 9, 11-17-2010) 
Sec. 20-34. - Fees for false alarms. 
(a)  Upon a response to any false burglar or robbery alarm by the police department, the police department shall charge and collect from the person having or maintaining such alarm on a premises owned or occupied by such person a fee as follows: 
(1)  For a response to false alarm at premises where no false alarm has occurred within the preceding six-month period, referred to as a "1st response," no fee shall be charged. However, the person having or maintaining such alarm shall, within three working days after notice, make a written report to the police department on a form to be provided by the police department, setting forth the cause of such false alarm, the corrective action taken, whether such alarm has been inspected by an authorized serviceperson and such other information as the police department may reasonably require to determine the cause of such false alarm and the corrective action necessary. 
(2)  For a 2nd response to a false alarm within six months after a 1st response, a fee as set forth in appendix A to this Code shall be charged and a written report shall be required as for a 1st response. 
(3)  For a 3rd response to a false alarm within six months after the 1st response and for each succeeding response within six months after the last response, a fee as set forth in appendix A to this Code shall be charged. If such 3rd false alarm or any such succeeding false alarm results from the failure of the owner or manager to take necessary corrective action, the police department may order the disconnection of such alarm system, and it shall be unlawful to reconnect such alarm system until such corrective action is taken, provided that no disconnection shall be ordered for any premises required by law to have an alarm system in operation. 
(b)  For the purpose of collecting the fees for false alarms, a notice shall be left with the owner, operator or agent of the premises or, in such person's absence, left at a conspicuous location on the premises, notifying the owner or agent that the police responded to the location for a false alarm and that a follow-up false alarm notice will be sent via mail, setting forth the requirements of this article, and the amount of the fees, and indicating whether this is the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or later response within a six-month period. The follow-up notice shall state that the fee may be paid within 15 days, as provided in section 20-35, and that, if not paid, the fees will become a lien on the property protected by the alarm system, unless within 15 days from the date of such false alarm an authorized person appears at police headquarters, during the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or at some other prearranged time, before an officer designated by the chief of police to receive such objections, to present an appropriate defense to the assessment of the fee. Such follow-up notice shall also state that any written or tangible evidence tending to support a defense should be presented at the same time. If the operator of the premises is leasing the premises from the owner thereof, the police department shall mail a copy of the notice to the owner of the property at the owner's address as it appears on the current tax roll. An appropriate defense shall be considered to be any cause that was completely and utterly beyond the control of the owner or operator to prevent, such as an act of God. Failure of the system to be in proper operating condition shall not be a proper defense. If no appearance is made and the fees are not paid, the lien shall be recorded as provided in section 20-35. 
(Code 1957, § 15-33; Code 1994, § 34-39; Ord. No. 10-12812, § 10, 11-17-2010)

    The fees imposed by this article are based exclusively upon the costs or a portion of the costs incurred by the city in responding to false burglar or robbery alarms and shall be deemed assessed on the day of the response. The fees may be paid within 15 days without interest. Thereafter, any unpaid fees shall accrue interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum and shall become a lien on the real and personal property protected by the alarm. Upon recording in the public records of the county a notice of lien setting forth the date of assessment, the legal description of the property and the name of the owner of the real property as it appears on the tax roll, the lien shall take precedence over any other lien against the property, except for liens for taxes, mechanics' liens and purchase money liens. The liens may be foreclosed against the real and personal property by the city at any time within 10 years after the date of assessment of the fee.

For the purpose of this subsection, excessive growth is defined as grasses or weeds exceeding 8 inches in height. 
(c)  Control of specific noxious plants. The city council has found growth of certain noxious plants to be a particular nuisance because they are invasive exotic plants which pose a risk to human health, safety and welfare. Therefore, on unimproved and improved lots in all zone districts, growth of Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), Australian pines (Casuarina spp.), downy rose-myrtle (Rhodomyrtus tomentosus), bischofia (Bischofia javanica), melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), earleaf acacia (Acacia auriculiformis), carrotwood (Cupaniopsis anacardioides), and Java plum (Syzygium cumini) vegetation which overhangs or grows across the property line shall be trimmed or removed by the owner. At the time of development of vacant land, or redevelopment of developed land, all specimens of the above-referenced noxious plants shall be removed from the site. All specimens of the above-referenced noxious plants shall be removed from vacant properties within platted, developed subdivisions (frequently referred to as infill lots), including areas zoned PD, within 5 years of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Regrowth shall be prevented through the proper use of approved herbicides or removal of trunks and roots. If, after the 5-year time period has elapsed, a property owner has not complied with this section, the city shall have the right to remove the noxious plants, using either city staff or outside contractors, and place a lien on the property to recover the cost of said noxious plant removal. As an alternative, the party responsible for the property may implement a city-approved noxious plant removal plan, to accomplish an orderly and cost-effective compliance with this section. Sale or planting of seeds, seedlings, juvenile, or adult specimens of the above-referenced noxious plants is prohibited. For the purpose of this section, redevelopment means the demolition of the main structure on a site, and its replacement by another structure. 
(d)  Refuse disposal by caretakers. All caretakers of individual properties not requiring a city certificate of competency maintaining property for 1 property owner, either single-family or multifamily, shall be considered to follow the owner-occupied maintenance guidelines in section 32-33.

All lawn maintenance, landscaping and tree trimming companies working for a property owner within the city limits are required to have a city certificate of competency and, effective July 1, 1992, shall be required to dispose of all refuse type II at a properly authorized disposal or recycling location, unless it is to be used as mulch on the property from which it was generated. Failure to properly dispose of refuse type II as required will result in a hearing before the code enforcement board with disciplinary action ranging from a 6-month probation for a first violation to revocation of competency card for a subsequent violation. 
(f)  Maintenance of right-of-way. For the purposes of this subsection, right-of-way shall include grass strips, alleys or alley easements up to and including the median point of the alley or alley easement, curbs, swale areas and stormwater management facilities and the rights-of-way up to the pavement of any public street.

e.  Whenever the owners and occupants of lots or agents for the owners of lots, unoccupied as well as occupied, shall refuse or neglect to correct the safety hazard within 10 days after notice, or without notice if the owner and occupant or agent cannot readily be found for the purpose of such notice or if the city determines that the obstruction poses an urgent threat to the public health and safety, the safety hazard shall be deemed a nuisance, and the city shall then perform the necessary work and shall assess the cost of such work against the property. Such assessment, if not paid, shall become a lien against the property.

(a)  Definitions. 
    A-weighted level (dBA) means the total broad band sound level of the noise spectrum as measured using the "A-weighted network" of a sound level meter (SML). The unit of measurement is the dBA. All sound level meter settings shall be for slow response, except for impulsive noise measurements which shall be fast response. 
    Ambient sound means the all-encompassing sound associated with a given environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many sources near and far. For the purposes of this section, ambient sound level is the level obtained when the sound level is averaged over a period of at least 15 minutes without inclusion of sound from occasional or occasional and transient sources, at the location and time of day near that at which a comparison is to be made. 
    Amplified sound means sound augmented by any electronic means that increases the sound level or volume. 
    Decibel (dB) means a unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micronewtons per square meter. 
    Impulsive sound means a noise which is characterized by brief excursions of sound pressure which significantly exceed the ambient sound level. 
    Nearest adjacent property line means the property line closest to the noise source. 
    Noise, or noise disturbance, means any sound that: 
    (1) Exceeds the maximum permitted sound levels set out in Table 1 of this section; or 
(2)  Is loud and raucous so as to unreasonably disturb, injure or endanger the comfort, repose, health, peace, tranquility or safety of reasonable persons of ordinary sensibilities; 
(3)  Constitutes a breach of the peace or a public nuisance;

Sec. 28-62. - Purpose and intent of article. 
    The purposes and intent of this article are as follows: 
(1)  To acquire, protect and manage environmentally sensitive lands that contain natural upland or wetland communities, native plant communities, rare and endangered flora and fauna, endemic species, endangered species habitat, a diversity of species, significant water resources, or outstanding aesthetic or other natural features, maximizing protection of unique or endangered habitats; 
(2)  To acquire, protect and manage environmentally sensitive lands that offer the best human social value, including equitable geographic distribution, natural resource based recreation, and protection of water resources, local ecological awareness, and enhancement of the aesthetic setting of the city; 
(3)  To acquire, protect and manage environmentally sensitive lands that serve to recharge the county's aquifers and protect its wetlands and surface water resources to ensure the delivery of clean and plentiful water supplies and provide flood control; 
(4)  To acquire, protect and manage environmentally sensitive lands containing the most biological value, including biodiversity, listed species habitat, connectivity, restoration potential, and ecological quality; 
(5)  To protect present conservation or preservation lands by acquiring, protecting and managing adjacent properties which, if not acquired, would threaten the environmental integrity of the existing resource, or which, if acquired, would enhance and buffer the environmental integrity of the resource, and add to resource connectivity; 
(6)  To restore the natural functions, as necessary, to any impacted and vulnerable habitats which would then contribute significantly to fulfilling this program's goals; 
(7)  To help implement the objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan which have been promulgated to preserve and protect environmental protection areas designated in the plan and other natural forest resources, wetlands, endangered species habitat, and vulnerable rare habitats; 
(8)  To identify the city's best and most endangered environmental lands for acquisition, protection and management by evaluating the biological and hydrological characteristics and viability of the resource, the vulnerability of the resource to degradation or destruction, and the feasibility of managing the resource to maintain its natural attributes; 
(9)  To manage acquired environmentally sensitive lands with the primary objectives of maintaining and preserving their natural resource values, and providing appropriate natural resource based recreational and educational opportunities, by employing management techniques that are most appropriate for each native community so that our natural heritage may be preserved and appreciated by and for present and future generations; 
(10)  To preserve lands that may not qualify as environmentally sensitive, but are otherwise worthy of restoration and preservation for the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; 
(11)  To acquire and manage interests in land such as conservation easements, scenic easements and any other interests that may assist in conservation or preservation of lands; 
(12)  To protect natural resources which lie within the boundaries of other conservation land acquisition programs, where funds would leverage significant other matching sources of funding for other agency acquisition projects that would not be available without such a local match, or which would result in considerably higher funding rank in another program and to enter into interlocal or other agreements for conservation and preservation; 
(13)  To cooperate actively with other acquisition, conservation, and resource management programs, including, but not limited to, such programs as program, the State of Florida Conservation and Recreation Lands program, the Land Acquisition Trust Fund, Florida Forever, and Save Our Rivers Program, where the purposes of such programs are consistent with the purposes of this program. 
(14)  To provide for acquisition, maintenance and preservation of a system of passive parks.

Sec. 28-67. - Criteria for evaluation of lands for acquisition and management. 
(a)  The evaluation of each acquisition proposal shall be based on satisfying at least 1 or more of the initial screening criteria below. Qualified sites shall then be further prioritized by secondary evaluative criteria listed below under subsection (b) of this section. The initial screening criteria are: 
(1)  Land with the most rare, unique and endangered habitats found in the city. 
(2)  Land offering the best human social values, including equitable geographic distribution, appropriate access for natural resource based recreation, and enhancement of the aesthetic setting of the city. 
(3)  Land which protects the most water resource values, including aquifer recharge, water quality, wetland dependant species habitat, and flood control. 
(4)  Land containing the most biological value, including biodiversity, listed species habitat, connectivity, restoration potential, and ecological quality. 
(5)  Land which enhances or protects the environment total value of current conservation lands through function as a buffer, ecological link, or habitat corridor. 
(6)  Any qualified land which meets at least 1 or more of the above criteria, and has matching funds available, is a significant bargain sale, or for which program funds availability would leverage a significantly higher funding rank in another acquisition program. 
(b)  Those proposed acquisition proposals which are initially qualified under the screening criteria shall be evaluated and ranked by the administrative staff using secondary ranking criteria based on site visit information which confirms or refutes the initial screening criteria evaluation, and based on comparative size (to prefer larger of similar parcels), vulnerability to destruction (to prefer most threatened of qualified parcels), overall resource ecological quality (to prefer highest quality of similar parcels) and the estimated feasibility and costs of management (to prefer most manageable parcels). 
(c)  The council shall approve and make a part hereof the attached initial list of target protection areas within which are located specific sites which generally satisfy the initial screening criteria and meet the goals of the program. Inclusion on this list is not a guarantee of any specific purchase. All specific proposals will be evaluated and ranked by the administrative staff for a recommendation of approval to the council. In accordance with the goals, policies and procedures of this article, the following list is the first list of target protection areas adopted for consideration. 
(1)  All designated conservation or preservation lands on the future land use map of the city's comprehensive plan with predominantly native vegetative cover. 
(2)  All natural resource protection areas, as shown on the future land use map. 
(3)  All undeveloped lands with predominantly native vegetative cover. 
(d)  The city manager shall prepare and periodically update, for presentation to the council, a Naples Conservation Lands Program manual or brochure, developed by administrative staff, which, upon approval by the council, shall be used as a guide for implementing the provisions of this article, and shall also include the initial and secondary criteria listed hereinabove for evaluating acquisition proposals. 
(Code 1994, § 46-83; Ord. No. 05-10818, § 1, 5-4-2005) 
Sec. 28-68. - Acquisition list. 
    The overall Naples Conservation Program Acquisition List shall consist of 2 specific lists: the target protection areas list and the active acquisition list. The council shall approve both in accordance with the procedures set forth below: 
(1)  The target protection areas list shall consist of lands representing the highest natural resource values (such as natural resource protection areas), but generally not specific parcels, and is initially approved by the council and updated periodically by the council. It is established and updated in accordance with program goals, procedures and criteria. 
(2)  The active acquisition list shall consist of criteria-qualified sites that have been selected from target protection areas, as well as qualified acquisition proposals submitted by the public, all of which have received positive responses from the property owners. The active acquisition list shall be updated periodically according to program procedures and criteria. Site acquisition proposals that receive the highest evaluations pursuant to the program criteria and for which acquisition is feasible will be placed on this list, pending approval by the council. 
(3)  Once approved by the council, the city shall actively pursue acquisition of projects on the active acquisition list. All sites shall be pursued on a voluntary basis only, without the use of the city's eminent domain powers. 
(4)  Projects will only be removed from the active acquisition list by successful purchase of the site, approval of the next succeeding list, withdrawal of positive interest by the property owner, or by resolution of the council. Projects removed may still be considered at a later time. 
(Code 1994, § 46-84; Ord. No. 05-10818, § 1, 5-4-2005) 
Sec. 28-69. - Nomination of acquisition proposals and candidate sites. 
(a)  Specific site consideration will be given to all individual properties which lie within the target protection areas list and which have generated a positive interest response to a letter of acquisition inquiry sent by the city's designated contact. 
(b)  Public and landowner applications nominating properties for acquisition may be submitted at any time, during or after the first annual public solicitation meeting (described below), by any person or organization, including the city, Collier County, or other regional, state or federal agencies. 
(c)  All nominations shall be made by filing an application with the city manager, which will then be forwarded to designated administrative staff for review. 
(d)  There will be an annual public meeting for the purpose of updating the council and the public and for soliciting proposals and applications. The first such meeting will take place by the end of the first year of implementation of the program. The first annual meeting will be conducted upon adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Future meetings will be held annually in conjunction with the city's budget cycle. 
(e)  If the applicant has an ownership interest in any real property covered by an application for proposed acquisition, such interest shall be disclosed in the same manner as required of zoning applicants, as required by the land development code and state law. This shall not apply to governmental applicants. 
(f)  If the applicant does not have an ownership interest in the real property covered by an application or if the applicant is a governmental agency, the name and address of the owner as listed in the property appraiser's records shall be provided with the application.

Sec. 28-70. - Procedure for selection of acquisition proposals for placement on the active acquisition list and subsequent purchase procedures. 
(a)  Administrative staff will send letters of inquiry to all property owners within the target protection areas. Positive responses will be forwarded to designated staff for preliminary review, using the initial screening criteria. 
(b)  After the first annual public solicitation of nominations, property owner and publicly nominated projects will be forwarded first to city staff for the mailing of inquiry letters. Designated staff using the initial screening criteria will review all positive responses. 
(c)  Nominated properties that do not fulfill the purposes of the program or do not satisfy the initial criteria will not be evaluated further. The city manager will notify the nominating person of the decision. If the nominating person disagrees with the decision of the city manager, that person may appeal the decision to the council by filing an appeal with the city manager within 30 days after the date of mailing of the decision. The council will conduct a hearing on the appeal and render a decision, which shall constitute final agency action. 
(d)  Proposals which satisfy the initial screening are then considered by the administrative staff for secondary criteria review and ranking. Staff shall consider with each proposal: boundary and location maps for each site, descriptions of the biological and hydrological characteristics, including initial criteria satisfied, a summary of its potential for appropriate use, development potential of the site and adjacent land, an assessment of the management needs and costs, the assessed value, and any potentially available matching funds. This acquisition proposal information shall be the initial criteria screening report. 
(e)  Upon completion of the initial criteria screening report, the council shall hold a public hearing to consider the recommendations regarding each site, the applicants' and landowners' comments, and comments from the public. A courtesy notice shall be provided to the owners of properties which are the subject of the hearing, although failure to notify said owners shall not invalidate these proceedings. The council shall evaluate all qualified proposals using the secondary ranking criteria, the initial criteria screening report, and public comments, then propose top-ranked proposals for the active acquisition list at this hearing. Subsequent meetings may be called to complete this task. 
(f)  The council shall vote on whether to approve all or part of the proposed active acquisition list and any additions that may be added to it. Additions may be added but any additional properties must be subjected to the entire evaluation process. 
(g)  After approval of the list, the administrative staff will prepare a project design report for each project, including appraisals, title research, history and purpose of project, and program qualifications. 
(h)  The council, after approval of the active acquisition list and the administrative staff's recommendations for negotiations, will instruct staff to negotiate for purchase for each listed project, with optional use of a 3rd party nonprofit organization negotiator, as authorized by the council. 
(i)  Upon successful completion of negotiations, staff will present to the council the proposed contract terms for review and approval. Staff will also forward the recommendations for contracts recommended for approval and for contracts that should not proceed as negotiated. 
(Code 1994, § 46-86; Ord. No. 05-10818, § 1, 5-4-2005) 
Sec. 28-71. - Management plans and use of environmentally sensitive lands. 
(a)  No later than 60 days from the date of acquisition, an interim management plan for any property acquired shall be submitted by staff to the council for approval and shall be implemented by the city manager pursuant to the council's direction. An interim management plan shall not be implemented for more than 2 years after acquisition of the property. Prior to the expiration of 2 years, either a new management plan shall be implemented or, by affirmative action of the council, the interim plan shall continue. 
(b)  A final management plan, with required review and updating every 10 years, shall be prepared, for each property, and shall: 
(1)  Identify such management activities as are necessary to preserve, enhance, restore, conserve, maintain, or monitor the resource, as appropriate; and 
(2)  Identify such uses as are consistent with the preservation, enhancement, restoration, conservation, and maintenance of the resource; and 
(3)  Estimate the annual costs of managing the project. 
(c)  If the final management plan is submitted within 60 days prior to closing, an interim management plan shall not be required. 
(d)  Annually, the 10-year management plans prepared during the preceding year shall be submitted to the council for review and update. Each 10-year management plan shall be updated at least every 5 years from the last date of council approval, and may be amended as often as required. 
(e)  All management plans shall be consistent with the purposes set forth herein. All properties acquired or managed through program shall be managed in accordance with the approved management plan for that property. 
(f)  No use, infrastructure, or improvement shall be permitted on any property acquired or managed under the program that is inconsistent with the purposes of the program or that is not provided by an approved management plan for the property. 
(g)  The city will seek cooperative management arrangements with other agencies and entities. 
(h)  Purchasing land using program funds permanently extinguishes all development rights except those strictly compatible with the purposes and goals of the program. 
(i)  Public access is an important element of management and this program. Examples of permitted uses, subject to compatibility with specific parcels, include: hiking, nature photography, bird-watching, kayaking, canoeing, swimming, hunting and fishing. The program will also make the acquired sites available, with minimal risk to the environmental integrity of the site, to educate Collier County's school-age population and the general public about the uniqueness and importance of the city's subtropical ecosystems and natural communities. 
(j)  Passive use parks will be an element of this program.

    Within the 90-day period immediately preceding or the 20-day period immediately following the date retirement begins, a member or former member may elect to be paid a pension under one of the optional forms of payment listed in this section in lieu of a level straight life pension. The amount of an optional form of pension payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of the level straight life pension. If a member or former member does not make a timely election of an optional form of payment, the member shall be paid a level straight life pension. The optional forms of payment shall be as follows: 
(1)  Option A, joint and survivor pension. Under option A, a retirant shall be paid a reduced pension throughout the retirant's life, with the provision that, upon death, the retirant's full reduced pension shall be continued throughout the future life of and paid to such person, having an insurable interest in the retirant's life, as a retirant shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board at the time of election of option A. 
(2)  Option B, modified joint and survivor pension. Under option B, a retirant shall be paid a reduced pension throughout a retirant's life, with the provision that, upon death, 1/2 of the retirant's reduced pension shall be continued throughout the future life of and paid to such person, having an insurable interest in the retirant's life, as the retirant shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board at the time of election of option B. 
(3)  Option C, social security integrated pension. Under option C, a retirant shall be paid an increased pension to the attainment of social security retirement benefits and a reduced pension thereafter. The increased pension shall approximate the sum of the reduced pension payable thereafter and the estimated social security primary insurance amount. This option shall be available only to: 
a.  Former members who retire pursuant to section 29-114; and 
b.  Members who retire on or after age 60 years pursuant to section 29-113. 
(4)  Option D, lump sum payment. Where a retirant or beneficiary is entitled to a pension, the monthly amount of which is computed to be $250.00 or less per month, the retirant or beneficiary, upon proof of good health, satisfactory to the board, may elect to receive or the board may elect to pay a lump sum payout. 
(5)  Option E, 10-year certain payout. A retirant may elect to receive a pension benefit paid out in equal monthly installments over a 10-year period and life thereafter; should the retirant die before the expiration of the 10-year period, the balance of the 10-year benefit shall be paid to the retirant's designated beneficiary.

(c)  Effective October 1, 2006, if an actively employed member has completed at least five years and six months of credited service at the time of death, the designated person or legal representative shall receive 100 percent of the contributions made to the plan for that member by the city, in addition to a refund of 100 percent of the member's contributions with regular interest. 
(d)  If a retirant and option A or option B beneficiary, if any, die before they have been paid an aggregate amount of pension equal to the member's accumulated contributions at the time of the member's retirement, the difference between the member's accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of pension paid shall be paid to such person as the member shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board. If there is no such designated person surviving the retirant and an option A or option B beneficiary, such difference shall be paid to the legal representative of the last to die of the retirant and an option A or option B beneficiary. 
(e)  Payment of refunds of accumulated contributions as provided in this section may be made in a single sum or in installments, as provided by the board.

The members' contributions shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law for any member shall be changed thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided in this section. Each of such amounts shall be deducted and when deducted shall be paid to the retirement system and shall be credited to the member's accumulated contributions. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any section in this article, any member may contribute to a voluntary deferred compensation (IRC section 457) plan in addition to participating in this retirement system.

(b)  Any section of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, if a member or retirant or beneficiary is paid a benefit from a former plan, the amount of any pension payable by this system shall be reduced by the amount of such former plan benefit. 
(Code 1957, § 18-54; Code 1994, § 50-249; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 1, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-128. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
    The city intends the pension fund to be a qualified plan under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and that the trust be an exempt organization under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code. The board of trustees shall administer the pension fund so as to fulfill this intent, including but not limited to the following: 
(a)  In the event the pension fund should terminate, or contributions to the system were completely discontinued, the rights of all employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination or discontinuance shall not be forfeited. The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city, or then current plan sponsor, if additional assets are required, in which event the city, or then current plan sponsor, shall continue to financially support the pension plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(b)  Maximum pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, the annual pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant shall not exceed the dollar limitation set forth below. If the benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(1)  Definitions used in this section. 
Annual pension means the benefits received by a participant under this plan expressed in the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable exceed the dollar limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the participant; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the participant, computed using a 5 percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table described in § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for that annuity starting date. 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the IRC and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this section, and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this section applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the IRC. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
Dollar limitation means $160,000.00 (subject to the annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as follows: 
a.  Except with respect to a participant who is a "qualified participant" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the IRC, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the IRC) beginning before age 62 the age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
1.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age 62, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 62 are equal to the dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the IRC for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a five percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the IRC that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
2.  The dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the IRC) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both annual amounts determined without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC. 
b.  For benefits beginning after the age of 65, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
1.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a straight life annuity commencing at age 65, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A) of the IRC (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the IRC that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
2.  The section 415(b)(1)(A) of the IRC dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) and § 1.415(d)-1 of the IRC for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan to the adjusted age 65 straight life annuity. The adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC. The adjusted age 65 straight life annuity means the annual amount of the straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial increases for commencement after age 65) as the participant receiving the distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 and without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC). 
3.  There shall be no age adjustment of the dollar limitation with respect to benefits beginning between the ages of 62 and 65. 
(2)  The limitations set forth in this section shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed $10,000.00 provided the participant has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(3)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the secretary of the Treasury under subsection 415(d) of the IRC. 
(4)  In the case of a participant who has fewer than ten years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is ten. 
(5)  Any portion of a participant's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under section 415 of the IRC. 
(6)  Should any participant participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the participant's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the participant's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the participant's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(7)  For a participant who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A-10(d), and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(8)  The determination of the annual pension under this section shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the IRC) social security supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the IRC and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant to § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(9)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of section 415 of the IRC, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under section 415 of the IRC and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this section and the provisions of section 415 of the IRC and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of section 415 of the IRC. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this section shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(c)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
(1)  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of 701/2 years; or 
(2)  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(d)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in this section. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
a.  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
2.  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
b.  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
1.  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in this section, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
i.  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
ii.  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
2.  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
c.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)a. and (2)b. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
a.  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
b.  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs a, b and c below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the IRC will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
a.  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
2.  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in this section, whichever is applicable; 
3.  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
4.  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
i.  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
ii.  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the IRC; 
iii.  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
iv.  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under this section, whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  For purposes of this subsection, distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse) before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with this section, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to this section. 
c.  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the single life table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations. 
(e)  Eligible rollover distributions: 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions: 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period often (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the IRC; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the IRC, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the IRC, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the IRC or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the IRC, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. An eligible retirement plan shall also mean, with respect to distributions made after December 31, 2001, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the IRC and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the IRC which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relation order, as defined in section 414(p) of the IRC. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes a participant or former participant. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in section 401(a)(31) of the IRC, payable under the plan shall be $1,000.00. 
(g)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17) of the IRC. In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000.00, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the IRC. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. 
Any reference in the plan to the limitation under section 401(a)(17) of the IRC shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(h)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

(4)  Member contributions. Upon the effective date of a member's commencement of participation in the DROP, the member's contributions to the retirement system shall be deposited into the member's DROP account. 
(5)  Benefit calculation.

Service thereafter shall not be recognized by the system or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the system. 
The average monthly earnings of the member shall remain as they existed on the effective date of commencement of participation in the DROP. Earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be recognized by the system or used for the calculation or determination of any benefits payable by the system.

(7)  DROP account earnings. 
a.  The member's deferred retirement option account shall be credited at a rate equal to the actual net rate of investment return realized by the system from the short term investment fund or money market mutual fund in which the system shall invest the member's DROP account. 
b.  A member's deferred retirement account shall only be credited with earnings during the member's participation in the DROP and until payout. 
(8)  DROP participation limit. A member may participate in the DROP for 84 months. Upon entering the DROP, the member shall irrevocably resign from city employment effective 84 months thereafter, although the member may earlier resign at any time during the 84 month DROP participation period.

During DROP participation, the member shall in all other respects be a city employee and subject to all of the obligations and benefits of city employment. 
(9)  Payout. 
a.  Upon the termination of a member's employment (for any reason, whether by expiration of the maximum DROP participation limit, retirement, resignation, discharge, disability or death), the retirement benefits payable to the member or the member's beneficiary (if the member selected an optional form of retirement benefit which provides for payments to the beneficiary) shall be paid to the member or beneficiary and shall no longer be paid to the member's deferred retirement option account. 
b.  Within 120 days following the termination of a member's employment, the balance in the member's DROP account shall be paid: 
1.  In full in a single lump sum payment, less withholding taxes; 
2.  As a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer "rollover" to another eligible plan; or 
3.  A combination of the 2 above. 
In case of death or disability, the 120-day payout deadline may be extended by the system's board of trustees until directions are received from the member's guardian or estate. 
Regardless of the option selected by the member, the board of trustees has the right to accelerate payments in order to comply with section 401(A)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the right to defer payments to comply with section 415 of the IRC. 
c.  Balances in a member's accounts after deduction of installment payments shall continue to be credited or debited with account earnings until the entire balance is paid out.

If a DROP member dies before said member's balances are paid out in full, the participant member's designated beneficiary shall have the same rights as the member to elect and receive the payout options set forth in subsection (9) of this section, above. DROP payments to a beneficiary shall be in addition to any retirement benefits payable to the beneficiary under any optional form of retirement benefits elected by the member. Members who are or have been DROP participants are not eligible for preretirement death or disability benefits.

(2)  The interest discount of 7.5 percent per annum, compounded annually. 
    Credited service means that period of continuous employment with the city as a firefighter for which the firefighter receives compensation or is entitled to compensation from the date of employment to the date of termination. Time spent in military service of the United States by the firefighter will be credited, provided the firefighter reenters the service of the city as a firefighter within the time period provided by state and federal law after date of release from such military service and returns to the retirement trust fund all amounts the firefighter might have withdrawn therefrom at the time the firefighter entered or while in such armed service. During the period of such armed service and until reemployment by the city, contributions to the retirement trust fund shall be waived and no payment of such contributions shall be required. 
    Final average compensation means the final average monthly compensation of the firefighter for the period of the highest three consecutive years of contributing service preceding retirement or the career average as firefighter, whichever is greater. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, effective June 1, 2013, final average compensation means the final average monthly compensation of the firefighter for the period of the highest five years of the final ten years preceding retirement or termination of employment, or the career average as a firefighter; provided, in no event shall the final average compensation of any firefighter who is employed on May 31, 2013 be less than the final average compensation determined in accordance with the preceding sentence as of that date. 
    Firefighter means a fulltime state certified firefighter employed by the city as a member of the city's fire-rescue department, including the chief of the fire-rescue department, the assistant chief and other firefighters of the fire-rescue department who are state certified as firefighters. 
    Prior service credit means a member may purchase service credit for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marine or service as a firefighter for the city or for any employer prior to employment by the city, by depositing into the trust fund the full actuarial costs of such service credit that would have occurred had the member been employed by the city as a firefighter, for the period of service credit purchased. Such payment for said service credit may be made as a lump sum or by payroll deductions, not to extend beyond three years, according to a schedule approved by the board of trustees. Payroll deduction payments shall require interest at the actuarial rate of return for the years purchased. Such purchase of service credit shall take effect upon attaining five years of credited service in the pension plan. If a member terminates service prior to attaining five years of credited service and receives a refund of member contributions, the amount paid for such prior service credit shall also be refunded, subject to the following: 
(1)  Prior service credit shall not be granted for service where the member is receiving or is entitled to receive a benefit from another governmental pension system. 
(2)  Prior service credit under this section shall only be provided for service as a firefighter, as defined in F.S. Ch. 175, with any firefighter service and/or for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, or the United States Merchant Marine, voluntary or involuntary, in accordance with F.S. Ch. 175. 
(3)  In determining prior service credit of any member for firefighter service or United States Armed Forces and Merchant Marine service, service credit of up to four years shall be added to the years of actual service with the city. 
(4)  Election to purchase credited service, for prior service with the city, prior service with any other firefighter agency or prior service in the United States Armed Forces or Merchant Marine, shall be made in writing to the board of trustees. The cost of credited service purchased for such prior service shall be the full actuarial cost of all credited service purchased hereunder computed as a lump sum payment into the plan. Actual payment may, at the member's option, be extended over a period of time not to exceed three years and shall be subject to interest at the actuarial rate of return for the years purchased. Such payment may be by direct in-service transfer from a firefighter's deferred compensation account (457 accounts) pursuant to section 457(e)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. Full payment of such purchased credited service must be completed prior to the member's actual retirement. 
    Salary means the base cash remuneration paid to the firefighter for services rendered, exclusive of overtime pay, holiday pay and fringe benefits. For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), Compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in code section 402(g)(3) of the IRC), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of sections 125 or 457 of the IRC. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in subsection (a) of section 29-242 hereof, compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of section 132(f)(4) of the IRC.

(2)  All payments from monies of the retirement trust fund shall be made by the finance director or by a custodian or funding agent designated by the board.

DIVISION 3. - MEMBERSHIP AND BENEFITS 

Sec. 29-231. - Contributions. 
    The retirement trust fund created in section 29-231 shall be maintained in the following manner: 
(1)  Contributions to the firefighters' pension and retirement trust fund shall be deducted in the amount of five percent from the salary of each firefighter hired prior to June 1, 2013, and three percent from the salary of each firefighter hired on or after June 1, 2013, so long as such firefighter shall be employed by the city. Any firefighter who enters the service of the city after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives shall be required to participate in the plan as a condition of employment, except for firefighters first entering service of the city at the rank of fire chief, who upon appointment to that position, may make an election to participate in this plan or another retirement plan which does not require a greater contribution by the city; provided, however, any officer who elects to participate in any other pension plan shall not be entitled to receive any benefit under F.S. Ch. 175 for any service rendered while a participant in such other pension plan. Notwithstanding any section in this article, any firefighter may contribute to a voluntary deferred compensation (IRC section 457) plan and may, if eligible, participate in the defined contribution supplemental retirement plan established by article III, division 4, of this chapter, in addition to participating in this plan. If the employer agrees to assume and pay member contribution in lieu of direct contributions by the member, such contributions shall accordingly be paid into the fund in behalf of the members. No member subject to such agreement shall have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer directly to the fund. All such contributions by the employer shall be deemed and considered as part of the member's accumulated contributions and subject to all sections of this plan pertaining to accumulated contributions of members. The intent of this language is to comply with section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(Code 1957, § 18-74; Code 1994, § 50-336; Ord. No. 93-7046, § 3, 11-3-1993; Ord. No. 98-8208, § 1, 3-18-1998; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 2, 9-15-1999; Ord. No. 07-11738, § 2, 8-15-2007; Ord. No. 09-12517, § 1, 9-2-2009; Ord. No. 13-13283 , § 2, 5-22-2013; Ord. No. 18-14265 , § 1, 12-5-2018) 
Sec. 29-232. - Requirements for retirement. 
(1)  The normal retirement date of each firefighter hired prior to June 1, 2013 will be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the firefighter has attained the age of 55 years, or attained the age of 50 years with 20 years of credited service, or who has completed 25 years of credited service and retires subsequent to March 31, 2000. Each member shall be 100-percent vested in accrued benefit upon attainment of normal retirement date. The normal retirement date for firefighters hired on or after June 1, 2013 will be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the firefighter has attained age 55 with eight years of credited service, or completed 25 years of credited service regardless of age. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, effective May 31, 2013 the accrued benefits of all firefighters who on that date are employed and have not attained age 55, or age 50 with 20 years of credited service, or completed 25 years of credited service as of May 31, 2013 shall be frozen. Such firefighters shall be fully vested in their frozen accrued benefit based on final average compensation and credited service as of May 31, 2013. The base monthly retirement income of such firefighters shall be payable in two parts: (1) the frozen accrued benefit based on credited service, final average compensation and plan provisions as of May 31, 2013; and (2) the accrued benefit based on credited service, final average compensation and plan provisions on and after June 1, 2013. 
(3)  The amount of the base monthly retirement income payable to a firefighter who retires before February 1, 1998, on or after normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of years and fractions thereof of credited service multiplied by three percent of final average compensation to a maximum of 75 percent. The amount of the base monthly retirement income for normal retirement benefits payable to a firefighter who has credited service after January 1, 1998, and retires on or after February 1, 1998, shall be an amount equal to the number of the firefighter's years and fractions thereof of credited service multiplied by four percent of average final compensation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (3), for credited service on and after June 1, 2013 the amount of the base monthly retirement income payable to a firefighter after the normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of years and fractions thereof of such credited service multiplied by three percent of final average compensation; provided, any firefighter who is employed on May 31, 2013 and as of that date has attained age 55, or age 50 with 20 years of credited service, or has completed 25 years of credited service, will continue to accrue benefits in accordance with the preceding sentence. In no event shall the combined monthly retirement income payable to a firefighter pursuant to the preceding two sentences exceed 100 percent of average final compensation. The maximums above shall not apply to any scheduled periodic or one-time cost-of-living benefit increases. 
(4)  The monthly retirement income payable for normal retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the firefighter's normal retirement date or on the first day of the month coincident with or next following actual retirement, if later, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the firefighter's death; except that, if the firefighter dies after retirement but before the firefighter has received retirement benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit to which the firefighter would have been entitled will be paid to the beneficiary as designated by the firefighter for a balance of such ten-year period or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, then such payment shall be made in accordance with subsection 29-238(b). If the firefighter continues in the service of the city beyond normal retirement date and dies prior to the date of actual retirement, monthly retirement income payments will be made for a period of ten years to a beneficiary designated by the firefighter, as if the firefighter had retired on the date on which death occurred or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, then such payment shall be made in accordance with subsection 29-238(b). 
(5)  Early retirement is retirement from the service of the city, with the consent of the board of trustees, as of the first day of any calendar month which is prior to the firefighter's normal retirement date but subsequent to the date as of which the firefighter has attained the age of 50. For early retirement, payment of retirement income will be governed as follows: 
a.  The early retirement date shall be the first day of the calendar month coincident with or immediately following the date a firefighter retires from the service of the city under this section prior to normal retirement date. 
b.  The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a firefighter who retires prior to normal retirement date under this section shall be an amount computed as described in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, such amount of retirement income to be actuarially reduced to take into account the firefighter's younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income payments. The actuarial reduction shall be equal to 0.25 percent per month for each month that early retirement precedes normal retirement. For purposes of calculating the actuarial reduction, normal retirement shall mean: for firefighters hired prior to June 1, 2013, the earlier of attaining the age of 55 or the date of completion of 20 years credited service with a minimum age of 50; and for firefighters hired on or after June 1, 2013, the earlier of attaining age 55 with eight years of credited service, or the date of completion of 25 years of credited service regardless of age. 
c.  The retirement income payable for the early retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the firefighter's early retirement date and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the retired firefighter's death, except that, if the firefighter dies before the firefighter has received retirement benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit to which the firefighter would have been entitled will be paid to the beneficiary designated by the firefighter for the balance of such ten-year period or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, the same monthly benefit for the balance of such ten-year period shall be payable to the person as set forth in section 29-238(b). 
(6)  Deferred retirement is retirement from the service of the city as of the first day of any calendar month subsequent to the firefighter's normal retirement date. For deferred retirement, payment of retirement income will be governed as follows: 
a.  The deferred retirement date shall be the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following the date a firefighter retires from the service of the city under this section. 
b.  The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a firefighter who retires subsequent to normal retirement date under this section shall be an amount computed as described in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section. 
c.  The retirement income payable for deferred retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the firefighter's deferred retirement date, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the retired firefighter's death, except that, if the firefighter dies before the firefighter has received retirement benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit to which the firefighter would have been entitled will be paid to the beneficiary designated by the firefighter for the balance of such ten-year period or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, such benefit shall be payable as provided in section 29-238(b). 
(7)  The pension formula and benefits provided for in this section and the board's recommendations for improvement thereto shall be reviewed in every odd-numbered year to determine whether changes in the cost of living indicate the need for revision to the pension plan for active or retired firefighters, or both. 
(8)  In no event may a member's retirement benefit be delayed beyond the later of the April 1 following the calendar year in which a member attains age 701/2 or April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which a member retires. Distributions under this plan will be made in accordance with regulations under Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirements of section 1.401(a)(9)-2 of the proposed regulations. Provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9) shall override any distribution options in the plan that may be inconsistent with such section. 
(9)  (a)  A cost of living adjustment (COLA) is added to the pension plan for firefighters retiring subsequent to March 31, 2000 and prior to October 1, 2002. The monthly retirement benefit for a retired firefighter, or to a joint pensioner designated by the firefighter, shall be increased by 2.25 percent each October 1 subsequent to the firefighter attaining the age of 55 years. In the case of benefits being made to a joint pensioner designated by the firefighter, the date of birth of the firefighter shall be used to determine eligibility for the adjustment. 
(b)  For firefighters retiring subsequent to September 30, 2002 and prior to July 1, 2005, the monthly retirement benefit payable to such firefighters or to any joint pensioners designated by such firefighters shall be increased, pursuant to procedures, methods and actuarial assumptions established by the board of trustees by 2.75 percent each October 1 subsequent to the firefighter attaining the age of 52 years. In the case of benefits being made to a joint petitioner designated by the firefighter, the firefighter must have retired subsequent to September 30, 2002 and prior to July 1, 2005, and the date of birth of the firefighter shall be used to determine eligibility for the adjustment. 
(c)  For firefighters retiring subsequent to June 30, 2005, the monthly retirement benefit payable to such firefighters or to a joint pensioner designated by the firefighter, shall be increased, pursuant to procedures, methods and actuarial assumptions established by the board of trustees by three percent each October 1 subsequent to the firefighter attaining the age of 50 years. In the case of benefits being made to a joint pensioner designated by the firefighter, the firefighter must have retired subsequent to June 30, 2005 and the date of birth of the firefighter shall be used to determine eligibility for the adjustment. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (9), there shall be no cost of living adjustment applied to benefits accrued on and after June 1, 2013; provided, the benefit of any firefighter who is employed on May 31, 2013 and as of that date has attained age 55, or age 50 with 20 years of credited service, or has completed 25 years of credited service, will continue to be adjusted as provided in paragraph (c) above. 
(10)  Supplemental 13th Check Retirement Benefit: There is hereby provided for all firefighter retirees who retired prior to or on March 31, 2000, in addition to all other benefits provided in this article, a one-time supplemental retirement benefit to be paid from the accrued "additional premium tax revenues" currently held in reserve, as defined in F.S. § 175.351(1). Payment of such one time supplemental retirement benefit shall be made to each such eligible firefighter retiree on or before December 31, 2010. The amount of such supplemental retirement benefit shall be equal to the monthly benefit paid to each participant for the month during which this ordinance is adopted. Such one time supplemental retirement benefit for eligible retirees shall be added to the next monthly benefit payment or paid separately as the trustees may decide. Should a retiree die between the adoption of this ordinance and December 31, 2010, payment of the supplemental retirement benefit shall be made to the retiree's designated beneficiary.

(3)  Such other amount and form of retirement payments or benefit as the board of trustees, in its sole discretion, may approve. The board reserves the right to require the retiring firefighter to pay the cost of actuarial services for computing an alternate benefit requested by the retiring firefighter. 
(4)  No form of benefit shall be permitted unless the present value of payment to be made to the participant is more than 50 percent of the present value of total payment to be made to the participant and the participant's beneficiaries. 
(b)  If a firefighter has elected an option with a joint pensioner and retirement income benefits have commenced, the firefighter may thereafter change designated joint pensioner up to two times as provided in F.S. § 175.333, without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. The amount of the retirement income payable to the member upon designation of a new joint annuitant shall be actuarially redetermined by the application of actuarial tables and calculations to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current benefit and that there is no impact to the plan. 
(Code 1957, § 18-76; Code 1994, § 50-338; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 2, 9-15-1999; Ord. No. 06-11152, §§ 5, 6, 3-1-2006; Ord. No. 07-11738, § 3, 8-15-2007; Ord. No. 10-12677, §§ 3, 4, 5-19-2010) 
Sec. 29-234. - Disability retirement. 
(a)  A firefighter may retire from the service of the city under this section if, prior to normal retirement date, the firefighter becomes totally and permanently disabled as defined in subsection (b) of this section, because of any cause other than a cause set out in subsection (c) of this section on or after the effective date of the plan. Such retirement shall be referred to in this section as disability retirement. 
(b)  A firefighter will be considered totally disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, a firefighter is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient service as a firefighter, and a firefighter will be considered permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, such firefighter is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other than as specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  A firefighter will not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the disability is a result of: 
(1)  Excessive and habitual use by the firefighter of drugs, intoxicants or narcotics; 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrection or while committing a crime; or 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while serving in any armed forces. 
(d)  No firefighter shall be permitted to retire under this section until examined by duly qualified physicians, psychologists and/or other medical, vocational and rehabilitation professionals, to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, and found to be disabled in the degree and in the manner specified in this section. Any firefighter retiring under this section shall be examined periodically by a duly qualified physician to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. The physician's, psychologist's and/or other medical, vocational and rehabilitation professional's determinations hereunder shall not be binding. 
(e)  The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a firefighter who retires prior to normal retirement date under this section shall be an amount computed as described in section 29-233(b), taking into account credited service to date of disability and final average compensation as of such date. The full accrued benefit, with no actuarial reduction, will be paid. No supplemental benefit as described in section 29-233(c) shall be paid in connection with or as part of the disability retirement benefits. 
(f)  The monthly retirement income to which a firefighter is entitled for disability retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the first day of the month following the date the board of trustees approved the payment of such retirement income. When the first payment is made, however, it will include benefits retroactive to the first day of disability. The last payment will be, if the firefighter recovers from the disability prior to normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery or, if the firefighter dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding the firefighter's death, or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled firefighter shall be paid to the beneficiary or, if no beneficiary is surviving, to the person provided in section 29-238(b). 
(g)  If the board of trustees finds that a firefighter who is receiving a disability retirement income is, at any time prior to normal retirement date, no longer disabled, as provided in this section, the board of trustees shall direct that the disability retirement income be discontinued. Recovery from disability as used in this subsection means the ability of the firefighter to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter. 
(h)  If a firefighter recovers from disability and reenters city employment as a firefighter, service will be deemed to have been continuous for the purpose of computing normal and deferred retirement or death benefits, but the period beginning with the first month for which the firefighter received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date the firefighter reentered the service will not be considered as credited service for the purpose of this plan. 
(i)  Any disability benefits payable to a firefighter at time of retirement shall be limited to an amount which, when combined with appropriate federal government benefits will not exceed the salary paid to the firefighter at the time of the occurrence of disability. 
(j)  Any firefighter who shall retire from the service of the city under this section as a result of a line of duty disability shall receive a minimum benefit equal to 42 percent of final average compensation and if as a result of a nonline of duty disability a minimum benefit equal to 25 percent of final average compensation. 
(k)  Any permanent disability, as defined in this section, which is the result of or caused by tuberculosis, hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, hypertension, heart disease or hardening of the arteries shall be presumed to have been incurred in the line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence or unless a physical examination of the member conducted upon initial hiring by the city revealed the existence of such condition at that time, and provided that a firefighter claiming disability due to tuberculosis or meningococcal meningitis provides the affidavit required by F.S. § 112.181(2).

(b)  Should any firefighter who separates from city service prior to June 1, 2013 with at least five years of credited service and has contributed to the firefighters' retirement trust fund for at least five years, elect to leave the firefighter's accrued contributions in the firefighters' retirement trust fund, such firefighter, upon attaining age 50 years or more, may retire based upon the benefit level, credited service and final average compensation which existed at the time of the firefighter's separation. 
(c)  Any firefighter who is employed on May 31, 2013 and separates from city service after that date with less than eight years of credited service and has contributed to the firefighters' retirement trust fund for less than eight years may elect to receive the frozen accrued benefit based on credited service, final average compensation and plan provisions as of May 31, 2013, upon attaining age 50; and a refund of all of the firefighter's contributions made to the firefighters' retirement trust fund on and after June 1, 2013, with interest at the rate of five and one-half percent per annum, less 1/2 of any disability payments made to the firefighter. In lieu of the frozen accrued benefit, such firefighter may elect to receive a payment equal to the greater of the firefighter's contributions made to the firefighters' retirement trust fund prior to June 1, 2013 or the actuarial present value of the frozen accrued benefit based on credited service, final average compensation and plan provisions as of May 31, 2013. 
(d)  Should any firefighter hired on or after June 1, 2013 leave the service of the city before accumulating eight years of credited service and before being eligible to retire under this article, such firefighter shall be entitled to a refund of all of the firefighter's contributions made to the firefighters' retirement trust fund, with interest at the rate of five and one-half percent per annum, less 1/2 of any disability payments made to the firefighter. 
(e)  Should any firefighter hired on or after June 1, 2013 separate from city service with at least eight years of credited service and has contributed to the firefighters' retirement trust fund for at least eight years, elect to leave the firefighter's accrued contributions in the firefighters' retirement trust fund, such firefighter, upon attaining age 50 years or more, may retire based upon the benefit level, credited service and final average compensation which existed at the time of the firefighter's separation. 
(f)  Any forfeitures arising shall be applied to reduce future contributions to the plan. No forfeited amount shall be applied to change benefit amounts for members. 
(Code 1957, § 18-78; Code 1994, § 50-340; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 2, 9-15-1999; Ord. No. 13-13283, § 4, 5-22-2013 ) 
Sec. 29-236. - Lump sum payment of small retirement income. 
    Notwithstanding any section of this article to the contrary, if the monthly retirement income payable to any person entitled to benefits under this article is $250.00 or less or if the single sum of the accrued retirement income is less than $5,000.00 as of the date of retirement or termination of service, whichever is applicable, the board of trustees, in its sole discretion, may specify that the actuarial equivalent of such retirement income be paid in a lump sum. 
(Code 1957, § 18-79; Code 1994, § 50-341; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 2, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-237. - Death benefits. 
(a)  Should any firefighter die prior to the earlier of the commencement of retirement benefits or normal retirement date, refund of 100 percent, with interest at the rate of 51/2 percent, of the contributions made to the retirement trust fund by such deceased firefighter shall be paid to the beneficiary or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, to the person as set forth in section 29-238(b). 
(b)  If a firefighter has completed at least 5 years of credited service at the time of the firefighter's death, the beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary is surviving, the person as set forth in section 29-238(b) shall have the option to elect a monthly benefit in lieu of the benefit outlined in subsection (a) of this section. If such an election is made, the benefit will commence on the first day of the month following the date of the firefighter's death. The monthly amount of the benefit shall be an amount computed as described in section 29-233(a)(2), with the recipient considered as a 100 percent joint pensioner, taking into account credited service to the date of the firefighter's death and final average compensation as of such date. The benefit shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the early commencement of the benefit and the age of the recipient of the benefits and shall be paid for the life of the recipient; however, should the recipient die before receiving payments for 10 years, the balance of the 10-year certain benefit shall be paid to the recipient's designated beneficiary 
(Code 1957, § 18-80; Code 1994, § 50-342; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 2, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-238. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each firefighter may, on a form provided for that purpose signed and filed with the board of trustees, designate a beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable for the firefighter's death, and each designation may be revoked by such firefighter by signing and filing with the board of trustees a new designation of beneficiary form. 
(b)  If there is no designated beneficiary living at the death of the firefighter when any benefit under this article shall be payable to a beneficiary, such benefit shall be payable to the firefighter's executors or administrators, provided that the board of trustees may at its option, but without any obligation to do so, pay such benefit as follows: To the firefighter's wife or husband, if living; if not living, to the firefighter's surviving children, equally; if none survives, to the firefighter's surviving parents, equally; if neither survives, to the firefighter's executors or administrators. Any survivor's share, however, may be paid to such adult or institution as has in the board's opinion assumed the custody and principal care of such survivor provided that no such payment shall be made after a legal guardian of the property of such survivor shall have been appointed and the board shall have received due notice of such appointment. The board reserves the right to assign any of its options, rights or elections set forth in this section to any company, providing an annuity contract for the benefit of the firefighter or beneficiary. Any payments made under this section, at the option of the board, shall not impose any liability whatsoever on the board or any member of the board.

    Upon termination of the firefighters' pension and retirement plan for any reason or upon written notice to the board of trustees that contributions under the plan are being permanently discontinued, the fund shall be apportioned and distributed in accordance with F.S. § 175.361. For the termination or partial termination of this plan, each participant's accrued pension benefit shall become nonforfeitable, i.e., 100 percent vested. The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city, or then current plan sponsor, if additional assets are required, in which event the city, or then current plan sponsor, shall continue to financially support the pension plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded.

However, the board of trustees, in its discretion, may employ its own legal counsel for such purposes, at the sole cost and expense of the board, and may retain such other independent advisers, such as investment advisers, actuaries, consultants, auditors and accountants as it deems necessary. If the board of trustees chooses to use the city's legal counsel or actuary, or any of the city's other professional, technical, or other advisers, it must do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board of trustees. 
(Code 1957, § 18-84; Code 1994, § 50-346; Ord. No. 97-7997, § 2, 6-18-1997; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 2, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-242. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, the annual pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant shall not exceed the dollar limitation set forth below. If the benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(1)  Definitions used in this section. 
Annual pension means the benefits received by a participant under this plan expressed in the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable exceed the dollar limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the participant; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the participant, computed using a five percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table described in § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for that annuity starting date. 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the IRC and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this section, and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this section applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the IRC. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
Dollar limitation means $160,000.00 (subject to the annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as follows: 
a.  Except with respect to a participant who is a "qualified participant" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the IRC, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the IRC) beginning before age 62 the age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
1.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age 62, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 62 are equal to the dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the IRC for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a five percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the IRC that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
2.  The dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the IRC) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both annual amounts determined without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC. 
b.  For benefits beginning after the age of 65, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
1.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a straight life annuity commencing at age 65, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A) of the IRC (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the IRC that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
2.  The section 415(b)(1)(A) of the IRC dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) and § 1.415(d)-1 of the IRC for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan to the adjusted age 65 straight life annuity. The adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC. The adjusted age 65 straight life annuity means the annual amount of the straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial increases for commencement after age 65) as the participant receiving the distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 and without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC); 
3.  There shall be no age adjustment of the dollar limitation with respect to benefits beginning between the ages of 62 and 65. 
(2)  The limitations set forth in this section shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed $10,000.00 provided the participant has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(3)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the secretary of the Treasury under Section subsection 415(d) of the IRC. 
(4)  In the case of a participant who has fewer than ten years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is ten. 
(5)  Any portion of a participant's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under section 415 of the IRC. 
(6)  Should any participant participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the participant's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the participant's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the participant's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(7)  For a participant who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A-10(d), and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(8)  The determination of the annual pension under this section shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the IRC) social security supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the IRC and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant to § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(9)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of section 415 of the IRC, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under section 415 of the IRC and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this section and the provisions of section 415 of the IRC and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of section 415 of the IRC. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this section shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(b)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
(1)  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of 701/2 years; or 
(2)  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in this section. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
a.  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
2.  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
b.  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
1.  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in this section, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
i.  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
ii.  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
2.  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
c.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)a. and (2)b. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
a.  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
b.  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs a, b and c below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the IRC will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
a.  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
2.  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in this section, whichever is applicable; 
3.  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
4.  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
i.  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
ii.  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the IRC; 
iii.  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
iv.  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under this section, whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  For purposes of this subsection, distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse) before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with this section, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to this section. 
c.  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  Eligible rollover distributions: 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions: 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period often ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the IRC; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the IRC, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the IRC, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the IRC or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the IRC, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. An eligible retirement plan shall also mean, with respect to distributions made after December 31, 2001, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the IRC and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the IRC which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relation order, as defined in section 414(p) of the IRC. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes a participant or former participant. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in section 401(a)(31) of the IRC, payable under the plan shall be $1,000.00. 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17) of the IRC. In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000.00, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the IRC. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. Any reference in the plan to the limitation under section 401(a)(17) of the IRC shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Sec. 29-243. - Errors. 
    Should the board determine that any person is receiving from the retirement system more or less than they are entitled to receive, the board shall correct such error and as far as practicable shall adjust the payment in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the person was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(Code 1994, § 50-348; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 2, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-244. - Assignments prohibited. 
    The right of a person to a pension, to the return of accumulated contributions, the pension itself, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or accruing to any person under this article and the monies belonging to the retirement system shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever and shall be unassignable except as is specifically provided in this section and in F.S. § 112.3173 and Article II, section 8(d) of the state Constitution, which provide for the forfeiture of retirement benefits upon conviction of felonies involving breach of public trust and other specified offenses by public officers and employees. The recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees to withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for any benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city's firefighters, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. The board of trustees may, upon the written request of the retiree of the pension plan, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for premiums for accident, health, and long-term care insurance for the retiree and the retiree's spouse and dependents. The pension plan, and its board of trustees, shall not incur any liability for participation in this permissive program should its actions be taken in good faith. 
(Code 1994, § 50-349; Ord. No. 05-10771, § 2, 3-2-2005; Ord. No. 10-12677, § 7, 5-19-2010) 
Sec. 29-245. - Supplemental share plan retirement benefit. 
(1)  Supplemental share plan retirement benefit. Effective October 1, 2009, there is hereby created a defined contribution plan component (supplemental share plan). The supplemental share plan retirement benefit satisfies the requirements under F.S. § 175.351(6) and shall consist of an individual share account for each active firefighter on or after the effective date hereof. The supplemental share plan retirement benefit shall be funded solely by premium tax revenues received by the city pursuant to F.S. Ch. 175; however, nothing herein shall be construed to require funding of, or guarantee a benefit under this section. The total initial amount to be allocated to the members' share accounts as provided herein, shall be $663,717.06. For plan years between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2017, all premium tax revenues received by the city pursuant to F.S. Ch. 175, in excess of $1,668,662.00 shall be allocated to the members' share accounts as provided herein. For plan years beginning October 1, 2017 and thereafter, the city and the union representing city firefighters have mutually agreed that no premium tax revenues shall be allocated to the supplemental share plan or member share accounts. At such time as the city and union mutually agree to allocate F.S. Ch. 175 premium tax revenues to the supplemental share plan, the parties will negotiate the amount of the allocation. Members' share accounts shall be credited with premium tax revenues and investment earnings or losses, and interest, and distributed as follows: 
(a)  Initial crediting. On or before April 1, 2011, the share account of each active firefighter on the city's payroll as of October 1, 2009, shall be credited retroactively an equally proportionate share of the accumulated excess premium tax revenues of $663,717.06, based upon a service based formula calculating each member's remaining years of credited service prior to their attainment of 25 years of credited service, as approved by the Professional Firefighters of Naples IAFF Local 2174 membership, and calculated by the fund actuary. Solely for purposes of calculating the initial crediting formula described in this section, military or prior service credit purchased by members shall not be included. 
(b)  Annual crediting. Effective January 1, 2011, and each January 1 thereafter following a plan year in which F.S. Ch. 175 premium tax revenues are allocated to the supplemental share plan, the share account of each active firefighter on the city's payroll as of the preceding September 30th shall be credited as follows: Each active firefighter who was employed on the preceding September 30th shall receive one share for each month of credited service, as defined in section 29-191, earned during the plan year ending on the same September 30th. The total number of shares thus determined shall be divided into the premium tax revenues allocated to the supplemental share plan during that plan year (or in the case of a supplemental distribution, revenues applicable to that plan year even if received after the end of the plan year), to determine the amount to be credited to the share account of each eligible share plan member. 
(c)  Investment earnings and losses or interest. Effective January 1, 2011, and each January 1 thereafter, the share account of each active firefighter shall be credited or debited with earnings or losses based upon the amount in the share account at the close of the immediately preceding calendar year at a rate equal to the pension plan's actual net rate of investment return for the preceding plan year. Members shall have the option to make up to three elections in writing to the board to have interest credited to their share account from a money market mutual fund, selected by the board of trustees, rather than credited or debited at the pension plan's actual net rate of investment return. All member share accounts will be credited with the pension plan's actual net rate of investment return unless otherwise elected by a member as provided for herein. 
(d)  Distribution of share accounts. An active firefighter with five or more years of credited service upon termination of employment shall be eligible to receive a distribution of 100 percent of the balance in his or her share account, together with all earnings and losses and interest credited to the share account through the date of termination of employment. No benefit shall be payable to an active firefighter who terminates covered employment with less than five years of credited service. The share account balances of such non-vested terminated members shall be redistributed among all eligible member's share accounts in the same manner as premium tax revenues in the following calendar year. The designated beneficiary of an active firefighter who has died shall receive the accumulated total of his share account balance. An active firefighter awarded a disability pension from the pension plan shall receive the accumulated total of their share account balance. There shall be no forfeiture of a member's share account based on the member's death, disability or termination of employment with five or more years of credited service. Such payment of share account benefits shall be by lump sum, which shall consist of the accumulated total balance of the active firefighter's share account, or, at the member's direction, the share account balance may be rolled over to another qualified plan in accordance with section 22-7 of the Internal Revenue Code, with an additional payment made for any amount credited in the year following termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 10-12807, § 2 11-3-2010; Ord. No. 18-14146 , § 2, 5-2-2018) 
Sec. 29-246. - Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(1)  A deferred retirement option plan ("DROP") is established for eligible firefighters, as provided in this section. 
(2)  Eligibility and participation: 
(a)  Firefighters shall be eligible to participate in the DROP upon attaining the normal retirement date in accordance with section 29-232. 
(b)  A member's election to participate in the DROP shall be irrevocable. 
(c)  An eligible member may participate in the DROP for a maximum of 60 months. An eligible member who wishes to participate in the DROP must provide at least 30 days' advance written notice to the city of his or her election to participate in the DROP. An employee who elects to participate in the DROP may elect to terminate DROP participation and city employment sooner than the maximum DROP period, with 30 days' advance written notice to the city. 
(3)  DROP plan features: 
(a)  An eligible member who elects to participate in the DROP will be considered to have retired for purposes of the plan. The member's monthly retirement benefit, determined in accordance with section 29-232, will be paid into his or her DROP account every month during the DROP period. No member contributions shall be required after a member enters the DROP, and the member will not accrue any additional creditable service or any additional benefits under the plan after entering the DROP. 
(b)  For eligible members who were employed on May 31, 2013, and as of that date had not attained age 55, age 50 with 20 years of credited service, or 25 years of credited service, the applicable cost of living adjustment component of the member's frozen accrued benefit based on credited service prior to June 1, 2013 will be applied to the member's monthly retirement benefit each October 1 after the member attains age 50. For eligible members who were employed on May 31, 2013, and as of that date had attained age 55, age 50 with 20 years of credited service, or 25 years of credited service, the applicable cost of living adjustment will be applied to the member's monthly retirement benefit each October 1 after the member attains age 50. No cost of living adjustment will be applied to the monthly retirement benefit of any member hired on or after June 1, 2013. 
(c)  A member who elects to participate in the DROP shall not be eligible for disability or preretirement death benefits under the pension plan. 
(d)  As a condition of participating in the DROP, the member must agree: 
1.  To separate from city employment at the conclusion of the DROP period, and to submit an irrevocable letter of resignation stating this prior to entering the DROP. 
2.  That participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and the member's employment will be "at will" during the DROP period. A DROP participant may be terminated at the discretion of the city manager upon receipt of an unsatisfactory performance evaluation. The member shall sign an agreement acknowledging their "at will" employment status prior to entering the DROP. 
3.  To submit an irrevocable written DROP election on forms provided by the city prior to entering the DROP. 
(e)  During a member's participation in the DROP, the member's monthly retirement benefit will be paid into the DROP account. A member's DROP account will earn interest at the rate of 1.3 percent per annum, compounded monthly. 
(f)  Within 30 days following a DROP participant's termination of city employment or death, the member, or in the event of the member's death the member's designated beneficiary, may submit a written election on a form approved by the board, to receive the member's entire DROP account balance, which shall be distributed to the member (or in the event of the member's death to the member's designated beneficiary or estate in accordance with paragraph (3)(f) below) in a cash lump sum, unless the member elects to have all or any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the member in a direct rollover. Any such direct rollover shall be accomplished in accordance with subsection 29-242(d) of the pension plan. In the event a member or designated beneficiary does not submit a written election to receive a distribution of the member's DROP account balance within 30 days following the member's termination of city employment or death, the DROP account shall be maintained but shall not earn interest. 
(g)  If a DROP participant dies before his or her DROP account is distributed, the participant's designated beneficiary shall have the same rights as the participant with respect to the distribution of the DROP account. If the member has not designated a beneficiary, the DROP account balance shall be paid to the member's estate. 
(h)  The forfeiture provisions of F.S. § 112.3173 shall apply to a member's DROP benefit.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 29-271. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Actuarial equivalence or actuarially equivalent means that any benefit payable under the terms of this trust fund in a form other than the normal form of benefit shall have the same actuarial present value on the date payment commences as the normal form of benefit. The determination of the actuarial present value of any form of benefit, including lump sum distributions, shall be based on: 
(1)  The RP-2000 Static Mortality Table (h) Unisex 50/50 for healthy lives projected to 2010 for healthy participants and the RP-2000 Static Mortality Table (d) Unisex 50/50 projected to 2010 for disabled participants; and 
(2)  The interest discount of 7.5 percent per annum, compounded annually. 
    Credited service means that period of continuous employment with the city as a police officer for which the police officer receives compensation or is entitled to compensation from the date of employment to the date of termination. Time spent in compulsory military service of the United States by the police officer will be credited, provided the police officer reenters the service of the city as a police officer within the time period provided by state and federal law after date of release from such military service and returns to the retirement trust fund all amounts withdrawn therefrom at the time the police officer entered or while in such armed service. During the period of such armed service and until reemployment by the city, the police officer's contributions to the retirement trust fund shall be waived and no payment of such contributions shall be required. 
    Final average compensation means the final average monthly compensation of the police officer for the period of the highest three years of contributing service preceding retirement or the highest five of the last ten years of service, whichever is greater. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, effective April 1, 2012 final average compensation means the final average monthly compensation of the police officer for the period of the highest eight years of contributing service preceding retirement; provided, in no event shall the average final compensation of any police officer who is employed on March 31, 2012 be less than the average final compensation determined in accordance with the preceding sentence as of that date. 
    Police officer means a full-time, state-certified police officer employed by the city as a member of the city's police department, including, the police chief, captains and other officers and police officers of the police department who are state-certified as police officers. 
    Prior service credit means a member may purchase service credit for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marine or service as a police officer for the city or any employer prior to employment by the city, by depositing into the trust fund the full actuarial costs of such service credit that would have occurred had the member been employed by the city as a police officer for the period of service credit purchased. Such payment for said service credit may be made as a lump sum or, at the member's option by payroll deductions, not to extend beyond three years, according to a schedule approved by the board of trustees. Payroll deduction payments shall require interest at the actuarial rate of return for the years purchased. Such purchase of service credit shall take effect upon attaining five years of credited service in the pension plan for members hired prior to April 1, 2012, and upon attaining eight years of credited service in the pension plan for members hired on or after April 1, 2012. If a member hired prior to April 1, 2012 terminates service prior to attaining five years of credited service, or if a member hired on or after April 1, 2012 terminates service prior to attaining eight years of credited service, and receives a refund of member contributions, the amount paid for such prior service credit shall also be refunded. 
(1)  Prior service credit shall not be granted for service where the member is receiving or is entitled to receive a benefit from another governmental pension system. 
(2)  Prior service credit under this section shall only be provided for service as a police officer, as defined in F.S. Ch. 185, and/or for voluntary or involuntary service in the Armed Forces of the United States, or the United States Merchant Marine. 
(3)  Prior service credit for police officer service and/or United States Armed Forces and Merchant Marine service, shall not exceed four years. Prior service credit purchased shall be added to the years of service with the city. 
(4)  Election to purchase credited service, for prior service with the city, prior service with any other law enforcement agency or prior service in the United States Armed Forces or Merchant Marine, shall be made in writing to the board of trustees. The cost of credited service purchased for such prior service shall be the full actuarial cost of all credited service purchased hereunder computed as a lump sum payment into the plan. Actual payment may, at the member's option, be extended over a period of time not to exceed three years and shall be subject to interest at the actuarial rate of return for the years purchased. Such payment may be by direct in-service transfer from a police officer's deferred compensation account (457 account) pursuant to section 457(e)(17) of the IRC. Full payment of such purchased credited service must be completed prior to the member's actual retirement. 
    Compensation or salary means the total remuneration including "overtime up to 300 hours" and "accrued leave lump sum payouts not to exceed $6,700.00" to a police officer for service rendered but not including any payments for extra duty or a special detail work performed on behalf of a second party employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, effective April 1, 2012 compensation or salary shall not include payments for accrued unused sick or personal leave, except as follows: unused sick and personal leave accrued prior to October 1, 2011 up to a maximum value of $6,700.00 will be used to calculate a member's frozen accrued benefit based on credited service up to and including March 31, 2012, provided that the amount of unused sick and personal leave accrued on March 31, 2012 is not less than the accrued balance on October 1, 2011. In the event the amount of unused sick and personal leave accrued on March 31, 2012 is less than the amount accrued on October 1, 2011, the lower amount will be used in the frozen benefit calculation. For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in section 402(g)(3) of the IRC), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of sections 125 or 457 of the IRC. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in subsection (a) of section 29-324, compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of section 132(f)(4) of the IRC.

Ch. 185. The board shall have full and unrestricted discretionary power and authority to hold, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any securities and investments in which any monies of the retirement trust fund have been invested, as well as the proceeds of such investments and monies belonging to the retirement trust fund, and may delegate this authority to one or more investment managers, who shall acknowledge in writing that they are named fiduciaries with respect to the retirement trust fund within the meaning of F.S. § 112.656 and who shall invest the retirement trust fund's assets in accordance with this article, applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and investment guidelines adopted by the board.

A duly attested copy of a resolution designating such persons and bearing upon its face specimen signatures of such persons shall be filed with the finance director, custodian or the funding agent. No such written authority to make payments from the monies of the trust fund shall be executed unless the payments shall have been previously authorized by a specific or continuing resolution adopted by the board.

Sec. 29-311. - Contributions. 
    Contributions to the police officers' pension and retirement system shall be deducted in the amount of five percent from the salary of each police officer hired before April 1, 2012, and three percent from the salary of each police officer hired on or after April 1, 2012, so long as such police officer shall be employed by the city. Any police officer who enters the service of the city after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives shall be required to participate in this plan as a condition of employment, except to an officer first entering service of the city at the rank of chief, who upon appointment to that position, may make an election to participate in this plan or another retirement plan which does not require a greater contribution by the city; provided, however, any officer who elects to participate in any other pension plan shall not be entitled to receive any benefit under F.S. Ch. 185 for any service rendered while a participant in such other pension plan. Notwithstanding any part of this section, any police officer may contribute to a voluntary deferred compensation (IRC section 457) plan and may, if eligible, participate in the defined contribution supplemental retirement plan established by article III, division 4, of this chapter, in addition to participating in this plan. The employer agrees to assume and pay member contributions in lieu of direct contributions by the member and such contributions shall accordingly be paid into the fund on behalf of the members. No member subject to such agreement shall have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer directly to the fund. All such contributions by the employer shall be deemed and considered as part of the member's accumulated contributions and subject to all sections of this plan pertaining to accumulated contributions of members. The intent of this language is to comply with section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Sec. 29-312. - Requirements for retirement. 
    Any police officer hired prior to April 1, 2012 who has attained the age of 50 or 25 or more years of credited service and has been a member of the retirement fund created in this article is eligible for normal retirement benefits. Any police officer hired on or after April 1, 2012 who has attained the age of 60 with eight or more years of credited service, or 30 or more years of credited service, and who has been a member of the retirement fund created in this article is eligible for normal retirement benefits. In such event, payment of retirement income will be governed by the following: 
(1)  The normal retirement date of each police officer hired prior to April 1, 2012 will be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the police officer has attained the age of 50 years or 25 years of credited service. The normal retirement date of each police officer hired by the city on or after April 1, 2012, will be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the police officer has attained the age of 60 with eight or more years of credited service or 30 or more years of service. Each member shall be 100 percent vested in accrued benefit upon attainment of normal retirement age. 
(2)  Effective October 1, 2006, the amount of the base monthly retirement income payable to a police officer who retires on or after normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of years and fractions thereof of credited service prior to April 1, 2012 multiplied by 3.63 percent of final average compensation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, effective March 31, 2012 the accrued benefits of all members who are employed and have not attained age 50 or 25 or more years of credited service (excluding prior service credit purchased on or after October 1, 2011) as of March 31, 2012 shall be frozen. Such members shall be fully vested in their frozen accrued benefit based on final average compensation and credited service as of March 31, 2012. The base monthly retirement income of members who are employed and have not attained age 50 or 25 or more years of credited service (excluding prior service credit purchased on or after October 1, 2011) as of March 31, 2012 shall be payable in two parts: (1) the frozen accrued benefit based on credited service and final average compensation as of March 31 2012; and (2) the accrued benefit based on credited service on and after April 1, 2012. The base monthly retirement income of members who are employed and have not attained age 50 or 25 or more years of credited service (excluding prior service credit purchased on or after October 1, 2011) as of March 31, 2012 shall be payable upon attaining age 50 or 25 years of credited service, or with an early retirement reduction upon attaining age 45 with 20 years of credited service, and separation from city employment. If such member terminates employment prior to the normal retirement date, he/she shall be eligible for a refund of contributions or benefit in accordance with section 29-317, in lieu of any other benefit under the plan. 
(3)  Effective April 1, 2012, the amount of the base monthly retirement income payable to a police officer who retires on or after the normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of years and fractions thereof of credited service on and after April 1, 2012 multiplied by three percent of final average compensation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the amount of the base monthly retirement income payable to any member who has attained age 50 or 25 or more years of credited service (excluding prior service credit purchased on or after October 1, 2011) as of March 31, 2012 shall be an amount equal to the number of years and fractions thereof of credited service multiplied by 3.63 percent of final average compensation. 
(4)  Any vested police officer (police officers hired prior to April 1, 2012 with at least five years of credited service; and police officers hired on or after April 1, 2012 with at least eight years of credited service) shall be entitled to purchase an additional benefit of 7.26 percent of final average compensation or such lesser amount as the police officer may choose. The police officer shall pay the full actuarial cost (as determined by the retirement system actuary) of such additional benefit purchased hereunder. Payment for this additional benefit must be completed prior to the police officer's actual retirement and may be made in one or more of the following manners: 
a.  Cash lump sum payment; 
b.  Direct transfer or rollover of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified or eligible plan, including direct in-service transfer from a police officer's deferred compensation account (457 account) pursuant to section 457(e) of the Internal Revenue Code; 
c.  Installment payments bearing interest at the retirement system's actuarially assumed rate of investment return under such conditions and terms as the retirement system's board of trustees may prescribe. 
(5)  In order to provide extra benefits during the years before the age of 62 when social security benefits first become available, a monthly cost of living adjustment (COLA) benefit shall be paid to any police officer receiving a normal or early retirement benefit who retired on or after January 1, 1998 and to the survivor of such a police officer who is receiving a survivor's benefit. The amount of the COLA benefit shall be a three percent annual increase to the pension benefit, effective on October 1st following the completion of at least one full year on retirement status and the attainment of age 55 and continuing each October 1st thereafter until the police officer attains (or, if deceased, who would have attained) age 62. The COLA benefit shall not be payable on or after the date on which a police officer attains the age of 62 or, if a police officer's death occurs prior thereto, the date on which a police officer would have attained the age of 62. In addition, commencing January 1, 2002 a one-time increase to the monthly benefits paid to all retirees and beneficiaries of retirees who have been receiving benefit payments for five or more years shall be paid in the amount of 0.5 percent for each full year of retirement, subject to a maximum increase of five percent. The city shall make deposits into the police officers' pension and retirement system equal to the full annual actuarial cost of such increase in the COLA benefit. 
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, effective April 1, 2012, there will be no cost of living adjustment (COLA) applied to benefits based on credited service on and after that date. 
(6)  The monthly retirement income payable for normal retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the first day of the month subsequent to actual retirement or as soon thereafter as possible, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the police officer's death; except that, if the police officer dies after retirement, but before the police officer has received retirement benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit to which the police officer would have been entitled will be paid to the beneficiary as designated by the police officer for the balance of such ten-year period or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, such payment shall be made in accordance with section 29-320(b). If the police officer continues in the service of the city beyond normal retirement date and dies prior to the date of actual retirement, monthly retirement income payments will be made for a period of ten years to a beneficiary designated by the police officer as if the police officer had retired on the date on which death occurred, or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, such payment shall be made in accordance with section 29-320(b). 
(7)  Early retirement is retirement from the service of the city, with the consent of the board of trustees, as of the first day of any calendar month which is prior to the police officer's normal retirement date. For police officers electing early retirement after October 1, 1999 early retirement must be subsequent to the date as of which the officer has attained the age of 45 years or has completed 20 years of credited service, whichever occurs earlier. For early retirement, payment of retirement income will be governed as follows: 
a.  The early retirement date shall be the first day of the calendar month coincident with or immediately following the date a police officer retires from the service of the city under this section prior to the normal retirement date. 
b.  The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a police officer who retires prior to the normal retirement date under this section shall be an amount computed as described in subsection (2) of this section, taking into account credited service to the date of actual retirement and the final average compensation as of such date, such amount of retirement income to be actuarially reduced to take into account the police officer's younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income payments. For police officers electing early retirement subsequent to October 1, 1999, the actuarial reduction shall be equal to 0.25 percent per month for each month that early retirement precedes the earlier of the age or credited service requirement for normal retirement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for police officers hired on or after April 1, 2012 the actuarial reduction for early retirement shall be equal to 0.4166 percent per month for each month (5.0 percent per year for each year) that early retirement precedes the earlier of age 60 or 30 years of credited service. 
c.  The retirement income payable for the early retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the police officers' early retirement date, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the retired police officers' death; except that, if the police officer dies before the police officer has received retirement benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit to which the police officer would have been entitled will be paid to the beneficiary designated by the police officer for the balance of such ten-year period, or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, the same monthly benefit for the balance of such ten-year period shall be payable to the person as set forth in section 29-320(b). 
(8)  Deferred retirement is retirement from the service of the city as of the first day of any calendar month subsequent to the police officer's normal retirement date. For deferred retirement, payment of retirement income will be governed as follows: 
a.  The deferred retirement date shall be the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following the date a police officer retires from the service of the city under this section. 
b.  The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a police officer who retires subsequent to the normal retirement date under this section shall be an amount computed as described in subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this section, taking into account credited service to the police officer's date of actual retirement and the final average compensation as of such date. 
c.  The retirement income payable for deferred retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the police officer's deferred retirement date, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the retired police officer's death; except that, if the police officer dies before the police officer has received retirement benefits for a period of ten years, the same monthly benefit to which the police officer would have been entitled will be paid to the beneficiary designated by the police officer for the balance of such ten-year period, or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, such benefit shall be payable as provided in section 29-320(b). 
(9)  The pension formula and benefits provided for in this section and the board's recommendations for improvement thereto shall be reviewed in every odd-numbered year to determine whether changes in the cost of living indicate the need for revision to the pension plan for active or retired police officers, or both. 
(10)  In no event may a member's retirement benefit be delayed beyond the later of the April 1 following the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the police officer retires. Distributions under this plan will be made in accordance with regulations under Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirements of section 1.401(a)(9)-2 of the proposed regulations. Provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9) shall override any distribution options in the plan that may be inconsistent with such section. 
(11)  The amount of the monthly pension being paid to certain eligible retirants or beneficiaries defined in this section shall be increased, effective January 1, 1990, by one percent for every two years of retirement, not to exceed a total of five percent. A retirant or beneficiary shall be an eligible retirant or beneficiary if the date of retirement is prior to October 1, 1987.

Sec. 29-315. - Optional forms of retirement income. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable for normal, or deferred retirement as specified in section 29-312, a police officer, upon written request to the board of trustees and subject to the approval of the board of trustees may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a larger monthly amount, payable to the police officer for lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the police officer during the joint lifetime of the police officer and a joint pensioner designated by the police officer, and following the death of the police officer, 100 percent, 75, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to the survivor for the lifetime of the survivor. 
(3)  Such other amount and form of retirement payments or benefit as the board of trustees, in its sole discretion, may approve. The board reserves the right to require the retiring police officer to pay the cost of actuarial services for computing an alternate benefit requested by the retiring police officer. 
(4)  No form of benefit shall be permitted unless the present value of payment to be made to the participant is more than 50 percent of the present value of total payment to be made to the participant and the participant's beneficiaries. 
(b)  If a police officer has elected an option with a joint pensioner and retirement income benefits have commenced, the police officer may thereafter change the designated joint pensioner up to two times as provided in F.S. § 185.341, without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. The amount of the retirement income payable to the member upon designation of a new joint annuitant shall be actuarially redetermined by the application of actuarial tables and calculations to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member's current benefit and that there is no impact to the plan.

Sec. 29-316. - Disability retirement. 
(a)  A police officer may retire from the service of the city under this section if, prior to normal retirement date, the police officer becomes totally and permanently disabled as defined in subsection (b) of this section because of any cause other than a cause set out in subsection (c) of this section on or after the effective date of the plan. Such retirement shall be referred to as disability retirement. 
(b)  A police officer will be considered totally disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, a police officer is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient services as a police officer, and a police officer will be considered permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, such police officer is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other than as specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  A police officer will not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the disability is a result of: 
(1)  Excessive and habitual use by the police officer of drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrection or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while serving in any armed forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(d)  No police officer shall be permitted to retire under this section until examined by a duly qualified physician, psychologist and/or other medical, vocational and rehabilitation professionals, to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, and found to be disabled in the degree and in the manner specified in this section. Any police officer retiring under this section shall be examined periodically by a duly qualified physician to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. The physician's, psychologist's and/or other medical, vocational and rehabilitation professional's determinations hereunder shall not be binding. 
(e)  The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a police officer who retires prior to normal retirement date under this section shall be an amount computed as described in section 29-315(b), taking into account credited service to date of disability and final average compensation as of such date. The full accrued benefit, with no actuarial reduction, will be paid. No supplemental benefit, as described in section 29-315(c) shall be paid in connection with or as part of the disability retirement benefits. 
(f)  The monthly retirement income to which a police officer is entitled for disability retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the first day of the month following the date the board of trustees approved the payment of such retirement income. When the first payment is made, however, it will include benefits retroactive to the first day of disability. The last payment will be, if the police officer recovers from the disability prior to normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery or, if the police officer recovers from the disability subsequent to normal retirement date or dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding the police officer's death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled police officer shall be paid to the beneficiary or, if no beneficiary is surviving, to the person provided in section 29-320(b). 
(g)  If the board of trustees finds that a police officer who is receiving a disability retirement income is, at any time prior to normal retirement date, no longer disabled, as provided in this section, the board of trustees shall direct that the disability retirement income be discontinued. Recovery from disability as used in this section shall mean the ability of the police officer to render useful and efficient service as a police officer. 
(h)  If a police officer recovers from disability and reenters city employment as a police officer, the police officer's service will be deemed to have been continuous for the purpose of computing normal and deferred retirement or death benefits, but the period beginning with the first month for which the police officer received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date the police officer reentered the service will not be considered as credited service for the purpose of this plan. 
(i)  Any disability benefits payable to a police officer at time of retirement shall be limited to an amount which, when combined with appropriate federal government benefits will not exceed the salary paid to the police officer at the time of the occurrence of the police officer's disability. 
(j)  Any police officer who shall retire from the service of the city under this section as a result of a line-of-duty disability shall receive a minimum benefit equal to 42 percent of final average compensation and, if as a result of a nonline-of-duty disability, a minimum benefit equal to 25 percent of final average compensation. 
(k)  Any permanent disability, as defined in this section, which is the result of or caused by tuberculosis, hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, hypertension, heart disease or hardening of the arteries shall be presumed to have been incurred in the line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence or unless a physical examination of the member conducted upon initial hiring by the city revealed the existence of such condition at that time, and provided that a police officer claiming disability due to tuberculosis or meningococcal meningitis provides the affidavit required by F.S. § 112.181(2).

Sec. 29-317. - Separation from municipal service; refunds. 
(a)  Should any police officer hired prior to April 1, 2012 leave the service of the city before accumulating five years of credited service before being eligible to retire under this article, such police officer shall be entitled to a refund of all of the police officer's contributions made to the police officers' retirement trust fund, with interest at the rate of five and one-half percent per annum, less 1/2 of any disability payments made to the police officer. Should any police officer hired on or after April 1, 2012, leave the service of the city before accumulating eight years of credited service, such police officer shall be entitled to a refund of all of the police officer's contributions made to the police officers' retirement trust fund, with interest at the rate of five and one-half percent per annum, less 1/2 of any disability payments made to the police officer. A police officer may voluntarily leave contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department, pending the possibility of being rehired by the same department, without losing credit for the time participated actively as a police officer. If the police officer is not re-employed as a police officer with the same department within five years, the contributions shall be returned. No interest shall be paid from the date of separation to the date of refund contributions. 
(b)  Should any separated police officer hired prior to April 1, 2012 who has at least five years credited service and has contributed to the police officers' retirement trust fund for at least five years elect to leave the services of the city and elect to leave accrued contributions in the police officers' retirement trust fund, such police officer, upon attaining age 50 years or more, may retire based upon the benefit level, credited service and final average compensation which existed at the time of the police officer's separation. Should any separated police officer hired on or after April 1, 2012, who has at least eight years credited service, and who has contributed to the police officers' retirement trust fund for at least eight years elect to leave the services of the city and elect to leave accrued contributions in the police officers' retirement trust fund, such police officer, upon attaining age 60 years or more, may retire based upon the benefit level, credited service and final average compensation which existed at the time of the police officer's separation. 
(c)  A refund of contributions under this section shall be in lieu of any other benefit under the terms of this trust fund.

Sec. 29-318. - Lump sum payment of small retirement income. 
    Notwithstanding any section of this article to the contrary, if the monthly retirement income payable to any person entitled to benefits under this article is $250.00 or less or if the single sum of the accrued retirement income is less than $5,000.00 as of the date of retirement or termination of service, whichever is applicable, the board of trustees, in its sole discretion, may specify that the actuarial equivalent of such retirement income be paid in a lump sum.

Sec. 29-319. - Death benefits. 
(a)  Should any police officer die prior to the earlier of the commencement of retirement benefits or normal retirement date, a refund of 100 percent, with interest at the rate of 51/2 percent per annum, of the contributions made to the retirement trust fund by such deceased police officer shall be paid to the beneficiary, or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, to the person as set forth in section 29-320(b). 
(b)  If a police officer has completed at least 5 years of credited service at the time of death, the beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary is surviving, the person as set forth in section 29-320(b) shall have the option to elect a monthly benefit in lieu of the benefit outlined in subsection (a) of this section. If such an election is made, the benefit will commence on the first day of the month following the date of the police officer's death. The monthly amount of the benefit shall be an amount computed as described in section 29-315(a)(2), with the recipient considered as a 100 percent joint pensioner, taking into account credited service to the date of the police officer's death and final average compensation as of such date. The benefit shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the early commencement of the benefit and the age of the recipient of the benefits and shall be paid for the life of the recipient; however, should the recipient die before receiving payments for 10 years, the balance of the 10-year certain benefit shall be paid to the recipient's designated beneficiary. 
(Code 1957, § 18-111; Code 1994, § 50-438; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 3, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-320. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each police officer may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board of trustees, designate a beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable if death occurs, and each designation may be revoked by such police officer by signing and filing with the board of trustees a new designation of beneficiary form. 
(b)  If there is no designated beneficiary living at the death of the police officer when any benefit shall be payable to a beneficiary, such benefit shall be payable to the police officer's executors or administrators, provided that the board of trustees may at its option, but without any obligation to do so, pay such benefit to the police officer's wife or husband, if living; if not living, to the police officer's surviving children, equally; if none survives, to the police officer's surviving parents, equally; if neither survives, to the police officer's executors or administrators. Any survivor's share, however, may be paid to such adult or institution as has, in the board's opinion, assumed the custody and principal care of such survivor, provided that no such payment shall be made after a legal guardian of the property of such survivor shall have been appointed and the board shall have received due notice of such appointment. The board reserves the right to assign any of its options, rights or elections set forth in this subsection to any company providing an annuity contract for the benefit of the police officers or beneficiary. Any payments made under this subsection, at the option of the board, shall not impose any liability whatsoever on the board or any member of the board.

    Upon termination of the police officers' pension and retirement plan for any reason or upon written notice to the board of trustees that contributions under the plan are being permanently discontinued, the fund shall be apportioned and distributed in accordance with F.S. § 185.37. For the termination or partial termination of this plan, each participant's accrued pension benefit shall become nonforfeitable, i.e., 100 percent vested. The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city, or then current plan sponsor, if additional assets are required, in which event the city, or then current plan sponsor, shall continue to financially support the pension plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded.

However, the board of trustees, in its discretion, may employ its own legal counsel for such purposes, at the sole cost and expense of the board. If the board of trustees chooses to use the city's legal counsel or actuary, or any of the city's other professional, technical, or other advisers, it must do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board of trustees. 
(Code 1957, § 18-115; Code 1994, § 50-442; Ord. No. 97-7997, § 3, 6-18-1997; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 3, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-324. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, the annual pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant shall not exceed the dollar limitation set forth below. If the benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(1)  Definitions used in this section. 
Annual pension means the benefits received by a participant under this plan expressed in the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable exceed the dollar limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the participant; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the participant, computed using a five percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table described in § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for that annuity starting date. 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the IRC and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this section, and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this section applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the IRC. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
Dollar limitation means $160,000.00 (subject to the annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as follows: 
a.  Except with respect to a participant who is a "qualified participant" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the IRC, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the IRC) beginning before age 62 the age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
1.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age 62, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 62 are equal to the dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the IRC for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the IRC that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
2.  The dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) of the IRC) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both annual amounts determined without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC. 
b.  For benefits beginning after the age of 65, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
1.  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a straight life annuity commencing at age 65, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A) of the IRC (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a five percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) of the IRC that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
2.  The section 415(b)(1)(A) of the IRC dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) and § 1.415(d)-1 of the IRC for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan to the adjusted age 65 straight life annuity. The adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC. The adjusted age 65 straight life annuity means the annual amount of the straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial increases for commencement after age 65) as the participant receiving the distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 and without applying the rules of section 415 of the IRC); 
3.  There shall be no age adjustment of the dollar limitation with respect to benefits beginning between the ages of 62 and 65. 
(2)  The limitations set forth in this section shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed $10,000.00 provided the participant has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(3)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the secretary of the Treasury under Section subsection 415(d) of the IRC. 
(4)  In the case of a participant who has fewer than ten years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is ten. 
(5)  Any portion of a participant's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under section 415 of the IRC. 
(6)  Should any participant participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the participant's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the participant's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the participant's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(7)  For a participant who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A-10(d), and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(8)  The determination of the annual pension under this section shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the IRC) social security supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the IRC and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant to § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(9)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of section 415 of the IRC, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under section 415 of the IRC and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this section and the provisions of section 415 of the IRC and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of section 415 of the IRC. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this section shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(b)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
(1)  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of 701/2 years; or 
(2)  April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in this section. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
a.  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
2.  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
b.  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
1.  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in this section, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
i.  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
ii.  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
2.  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
c.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)a. and (2)b. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
a.  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
b.  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs a, b and c below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the IRC will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
a.  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
2.  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in this section, whichever is applicable; 
3.  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
4.  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
i.  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
ii.  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the IRC; 
iii.  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
iv.  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under this section, whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  For purposes of this subsection, distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse) before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with this section, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the IRC and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to this section. 
c.  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  Eligible rollover distributions: 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions: 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period often ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the IRC; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the IRC, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the IRC, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the IRC or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the IRC, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. An eligible retirement plan shall also mean, with respect to distributions made after December 31, 2001, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the IRC and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the IRC which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relation order, as defined in section 414(p) of the IRC. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes a participant or former participant. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in section 401(a)(31) of the IRC, payable under the plan shall be $1,000.00. 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17) of the IRC. In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000.00, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the IRC. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. Any reference in the plan to the limitation under section 401(a)(17) of the IRC shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(Code 1994, § 50-443; Ord. No. 94-7318, § 1, 12-7-1994; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 3, 9-15-1999; Ord. No. 10-12678, § 6, 5-19-2010) 
Sec. 29-325. - Errors. 
    Should the board determine that any person is receiving from the retirement system more or less than they are entitled to receive, the board shall correct such error and as far as practicable shall adjust the payment in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the person was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(Code 1994, § 50-444; Ord. No. 99-8642, § 3, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 29-326. - Assignments prohibited. 
    The right of a person to a pension, to the return of accumulated contributions, the pension itself, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or accruing to any person under this article and the monies belonging to the retirement system shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever and shall be unassignable except as is specifically provided in this section and in F.S. § 112.3173 and article II, section 8(d) of the state constitution which, provide for the forfeiture of retirement benefits upon conviction of felonies involving breach of public trust and other specified offenses by public officers and employees. The recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees to withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for any benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city's police officers, and to make any payments for child support or alimony.

Sec. 30-12. - Regulations. 
(a)  Limitation of use, continuity of service. 
(1)  Unless authorized by the city, water, sewer and reclaimed water service purchased from the city shall be used by the consumer only for the purposes specified in the application for service, and the property owner shall not sell or otherwise dispose of such service supplied by the city. Unless authorized by the city, service furnished to the property owner shall be rendered directly to the property owner through the city's connection, and under no circumstances shall the property owner or property owner's agent or any other individual, association, or corporation install equipment for the purpose of disposing of said service. In no case shall a property owner, except with the written consent from the city, extend an installation across a street, alley, lane, court, property line, avenue, or any other way, in order to furnish service for adjacent property, even though such adjacent property is owned by them. In the event there is an unauthorized owner extension, sale or disposition of service, the property owner's service will be subject to discontinuance until such unauthorized extension, sale or disposition is discontinued and full payment is made of bills for service, calculated on proper classification and rate schedules and reimbursements in full are made to the city for all extra expenses incurred for clerical work, testing and inspections. 
(2)  The city will use reasonable diligence to provide continuous service, but shall not be liable to the property owner or occupants for failure or interruption of continuous water service. The city shall not be liable for any act or omission caused directly by strikes, labor troubles, accident, litigation, breakdowns, shutdowns for emergency repairs, or adjustment, acts of sabotage, enemies of the United States, wars, state, municipal or other governmental interference, acts of God or other causes beyond its control. 
(3)  Property owners shall maintain that portion of the water and reclaimed water lines on their property located beyond the city water meter, and all loss of water through breaks or leakage to the premises shall be the responsibility of, and paid by, the property owner.

A blockage between the property line and the sewer main (lateral) shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
(b)  Property owner's liability for damage to equipment. The property owner is liable to the city for any damage done to the city's equipment used in providing service to the property owner, except damage done by city employees. 
(c)  Property owner's responsibility for utility service; bad debts. 
(1)  The property owner is responsible for all utility services provided to the property. In the event service is discontinued for non-payment, service will be restored only after property owner has fully complied with provisions of this article. 
(2)  Unpaid fees constitute a lien against the property. In the event utility services have been discontinued for non-payment and any or all services are requested to be reinstated for the property in the future, this debt plus associated charges must be paid before water or sewer service will be furnished. 
(3)  Bad debts as a result of bankruptcy or court actions will be written off in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
(d)  Dates bills due and delinquent; discontinuance of service for non-payment; reinstatement following discontinued service. 
(1)  Bills for service are due by the date set forth on the utility bill and are delinquent thereafter. Service shall be discontinued when delinquent for non-payment of bills. 
(2)  When service has been discontinued for non-payment of bills, service will be renewed upon payment of all unpaid bills, plus a reinstatement fee and a late payment fee as provided in appendix A, fees and charges schedule, to this Code. Fee for service performed, at the request of the customer, outside of the normal service hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Fridays, and on holidays, shall be as set forth in appendix A, fees and charges schedule, to this Code. 
(3)  If the meter has been locked and the lock has been tampered with and the street cock has been turned on prior to full payment of all fees, the meter may be locked or removed from the property. Should the property owner request renewal of service for the property, service will be restored upon full payment of: (1) all past due bills plus a late payment fee where applicable, and (2) a meter removal/lock fee [appendix A, fees and charges schedule, to this Code]. 
(4)  If service has been discontinued for non-payment of bills and an illegal water connection is made, service will be renewed upon payment of all unpaid bills, time and material cost to remove the illegal connection, the cost of the estimated amount of water consumption loss, plus the fine specified in appendix A, fees and charges schedule, to this Code. 
(5)  Billing for potable water, sewer, and reclaimed water service shall begin upon registration of consumption on the meter, or 90 days from date of meter installation, whichever occurs first. Billing for sewer service shall commence upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or 90 days following the issuance of a notice to connect to the sewer system, whichever occurs first. 
(6)  The property owner shall immediately notify the city of any additional dwelling or business units connected to the city's service lines if the units have not been included in previous applications. For violation of this section, the city's service may be discontinued. 
(7)  Non-sufficient funds (NSF) checks returned by the city's bank will not normally be reprocessed for payment. The amount of the NSF check plus an appropriate NSF charge [appendix A, fees and charges schedule, to this Code] and where applicable any other fees and charges will be placed on the account for rebilling. 
(e)  Billing payment when meter becomes defective; right of entry of authorized agents or employees. 
(1)  Should the meter on any premises become defective, so that the amount delivered for the billing cycle cannot be ascertained, the property owner shall pay an amount equal to the average amount charged for the four preceding bi-monthly bills unless the actual amount of water can be determined. 
(2)  Duly authorized agents and employees of the city shall, at all times have access to any property for the purpose of examining the condition of fixture, service pipe installation and such other purposes as may be proper to protect the interest of the city, reading or repairing the water meters located thereon, or turning the supply of utility service to the premises off or on. 
(f)  Utility bill complaints. Normally, high water bill complaints will not be cause for inspection by the city unless all plumbing fixtures, piping and outlets have been examined by a licensed plumber who has certified that there are no leaks. If an investigation is made by the city and the findings reveal the initial meter reading was accurate and the meter is functioning properly, a re-read charge [appendix A, fees and charges schedule, to this Code] will be assessed against the property owner. The property owner, upon request that the meter be tested for accuracy, shall be charged for meter tests when it has been determined that the meter is functioning properly (appendix A, fees and charges schedule, to this Code). 
(g)  Unpaid fees to constitute a lien. In the event that the fees, rates or charges for the services and facilities of any utilities shall not be paid as and when due, any unpaid balance thereof and all interest accruing thereon shall be an automatic lien on any parcel or property affected thereby. Except as may be provided by general law, such liens shall be superior and paramount to the interest on such parcel or property of any owner, lessee, tenant, mortgagor or other person except the lien of county taxes and shall be on a parity with the lien of any such county taxes. In the event that any such fees, rates or charges shall not be paid as and when due and shall be in default for 30 days or more the unpaid balance thereof and all interest accrued thereon, together with attorneys fees and costs, may be recovered by the city in a civil action, and any such lien and accrued interest may be foreclosed or otherwise enforced by the city by action or suit in equity as for the foreclosure of a mortgage on real property. 
(h)  After reasonable attempts to collect bad debts have been exhausted, bad debts may be taken off the books in accordance with established procedures. Write off of bad debt does not constitute a forgiveness of the debt, and debts are to be paid before utility service can be provided to the debtor. 
(i)  No free service. No utility service shall be furnished or rendered free of charge to any person, firm, corporation or governmental body.

Sec. 30-162. - Compliance with regulatory requirements. 
(a)  Generally. The provisions of these regulations shall not be deemed as alleviating compliance with applicable state and federal regulations. Specific user charge and industrial cost recovery requirements, promulgated pursuant to Public Law 92-500, shall be considered as a part of these regulations upon official adoption. All nonresidential users will be required to comply with pretreatment standards as outlined in 40 CFR 403. 
(b)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards status. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under these regulations for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under these regulations. The administrator shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12, or latest revision thereof. 
(c)  Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards. Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean the average of the lowest 50 percent of the removal measured according to 40 CFR 403.7(b)(2), promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(d)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in these regulations. 
(e)  City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in this article. 
(f)  Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state, unless specifically allowed in the categorical pretreatment standards established by EPA. 
(g)  Accidental discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by these regulations. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city manager for review, and shall be approved by the city manager before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan 4 months after enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of these regulations shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city manager. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of these regulations. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(h)  Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the city manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(i)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(d)  Surcharge for abnormal strength waste discharge. Abnormal strength wastes are those that do not meet the limitations set forth in this article. 
(1)  Computation. The surcharge in dollars shall be computed by multiplying the total mg/l of BOD and suspended solids above 500 mg/l times the metered water used during the billing period in millions of gallons times a treatment surcharge factor. The surcharge factor shall be derived annually from the following formula: 
Surcharge 
Factor =  Cost of treatment per 1,000,000 gallons 
500  
Where: 
Cost of treatment per 1,000,000 gallons equals operational costs of the city sewage treatment plants for the preceding fiscal year (including pro rata administrative costs) divided by the total sewage flow through all plants in millions of gallons. 
500 equals maximum normal BOD plus suspended solids content expressed in milligrams per liter. 
The surcharge in dollars for fats, waxes, grease, oil and solvent-soluble substances shall be computed by multiplying the total fats, waxes, grease, oil, and solvent-soluble substances above the legal limits as set forth in this section times the metered water used during the billing period in millions of gallons times the treatment surcharge factor. 
(2)  Relativity of fees. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by these regulations and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the city.

(a)  Wells. Except where permitted by city council action, it shall be unlawful to drive, jet, dig, or drill a well within the city water service franchise area, having a depth greater than 25 feet, measured from the ground surface to the bottom of the well. It is the intent of this subsection to prohibit the construction of wells which would penetrate the underground aquifer from which the municipal supply is derived. Since the depth from ground surface to the top of this aquifer varies somewhat in different areas of the city, the fixture of 25 feet represents an average value, and is subject to reasonable interpretation by the city manager, at the time the permit is requested, based upon records and information available in the files of the city or local, state, and federal regulatory agencies. The city manager's decision in every case shall be final. 
(b)  Sand point wells. It shall be unlawful to drive, jet, dig or drill a sand point well within the city water franchise area having a depth greater than 20 feet measured from the ground surface to the well point.

ARTICLE VII. - WATER AND SANITARY SEWER EXTENSIONS AND CONNECTIONS, SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES AND CONNECTION FEES[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-12289, § 1, adopted December 3, 2008, effective April 1, 2009, amended Art. VII, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Art. VII pertained to fees and charges. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 30-371. - Intent and purpose of division. 
(a)  The city council has determined and recognized that the growth rate within the city's urban service area is experiencing will necessitate extensive facilities improvements and make it necessary to regulate new development in order to maintain water and sanitary sewer facilities at an acceptable level of service so as to maintain quality of life in the utility service area. In order to finance the necessary new capital improvements and to purchase necessary equipment, several combined financing methods will be necessary, one of which will require new development to pay a system development charge which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new water and sanitary sewer facilities. 
(b)  Providing water and sanitary sewer service in the city's urban service area is a recognized proprietary power of the city through F.S. § 166.021 and Chapter 180 and is in the best interests of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(c)  Implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay a water and sanitary sewer capital development charge that does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new water and sanitary sewer facilities created by the new land development activity is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the comprehensive plan, as amended, and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(d)  The purpose of this article is to continue to enable the city to allow new development in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan and to regulate new development activity generating water and sanitary sewer demand so as to require it to share in the burdens of growth by paying its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of water and sanitary sewer facilities improvements. Thus, new growth will help pay for itself, and the existing water and sanitary sewer customers of the city will not have the full financial burden of providing increased water and sanitary sewer capacity at the outset. 
(e)  It is the purpose of this article to establish a system to assist in providing increased capacity for the water and sanitary sewer operations to accommodate the increased demand new development will have on the existing operations and to recover costs associated with the extension and connection to the utility system. New land development activity within the city's urban service area will be required to pay a fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated costs of new water and sanitary sewer facilities and other facilities than its presence necessitates.

(Ord. No. 08-12289, § 1, 12-3-2008, eff. 4-1-2009; Ord. No. 14-13442, § 3, 4-2-2014 ) 
Sec. 30-373. - Water and sanitary sewer system development charges (impact fees); connection fees; and hydrant service fees. 
(a)  Special assessments. Owners of properties that have been assessed for sanitary sewer collection lines and water distribution lines serving their property shall pay a system development charge as set forth in Appendix A to this Code prior to connection. 
(b)  Connection to the system. All development within the city's utility service area (urban service area) who desire to connect to the water or sanitary sewer system shall pay the system development charges, system connection charges, an application fee, and a plan review and inspection fee as set forth in Appendix A to this Code for a given parcel of property prior to the issuance of a building permit. System development charges shall be imposed and calculated for alterations, expansion, or replacement of residential and non-residential structures and uses provided such alteration, expansion, or replacement results in an increase in the size of the water meter, the number of units, or intensity of use(s) 
(1)  For single-family residence and non-residential development, the equivalent residential unit based upon the size of the water meter shall determine the system development charge for water and sewer service. 
(2)  For multi-family residence, the number of dwelling units shall determine the system development charge for water and sewer service. 
(c)  The cost of extensions to the city's water distribution system and sanitary sewer collection system and charges provided in Appendix A shall be paid by the applicant. At the sole discretion of the city, the extension shall be constructed by the city or the city may grant permission to the applicant to construct the extension provided such construction meets the requirements of the city. 
(1)  When an extension is performed by the city and the cost paid in advance by the applicant is less than the actual project cost, the applicant shall pay the additional cost. If the actual cost is less, the applicant shall be refunded the difference between the payment and the actual cost. 
(2)  For new connections to the extended system within three years following the completion of construction, such new connections shall be required to pay their pro-rata share of the cost of the extension plus appropriate system development and connection charges to the city. The city shall then refund to the original extension applicant the pro-rate share of the cost of the extension collected within the three-year period. 
(d)  Developer installed systems. Where developers install transmission, distribution or collection systems at their own expense, there shall be no connection charge to individual lot owners. Should the city require an applicant to install a larger distribution or collection line than the size proposed by the developer or required by the city, the city will pay the difference between the cost to install the original line and the larger line. 
(e)  Meters. 
(1)  All water meters will be furnished by the city and shall remain the property of the city. 
(2)  Meters must be left accessible to city employees at all times. 
(3)  When any customer who has a water meter makes application for the installation of a larger meter to replace a smaller meter, the appropriate system development and tapping charge as set forth in Appendix A shall apply. There shall be no refunds or credits given to any customer requesting a smaller meter, and no tapping charge will be assessed against a customer requesting a smaller meter.

Sec. 30-376. - Alternative system development charges. 
(a)  The system development charges may be determined by an alternative charge calculation of the fiscal impact of the development on the water and sanitary sewer facilities if: 
(1)  Any person commencing a development which increases demand on the water and sanitary sewer facility chooses to have the impact fee determined by the alternative fee calculation; pays to the city in full the impact fee calculated pursuant to the applicable impact fee rate schedule; pays a nonrefundable alternative fee calculation review fee of $2,500.00 initially, and the actual cost upon completed review if in excess of $2,500.00; or any other review fee amount then established by the city council by ordinance or resolution; and 
(2)  The applicant believes that the nature, timing or location of the proposed development makes it likely to generate impacts costing less than the amount of the system development charges set forth in section 30-373 of appendix A, and 
(3)  The applicant commences the alternative charge calculation process by requesting in writing to the city manager, and attends a pre-application meeting within 180 days of the issuance of the building permit for the development. 
(b)  The alternative charge calculation shall be undertaken through the submission of an impact analysis for the water and sanitary sewer facilities, which shall be based on data, information, methodology and assumptions contained in this article, or an independent source, including local studies for alternative system development charge calculations performed by others within the immediately preceding three years, provided that the independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed pursuant to a methodology generally accepted by professionals in the field of expertise for the water and sanitary sewer facilities and based upon standard sources of information relating to facilities planning, cost analysis and demographics and generally accepted by professionals in the field of expertise for the water and sanitary sewer facilities. Technical details of approach, methodology, procedures, and other matters relating to the alternative fee calculation may be addressed in an administrative procedures manual. 
(c)  The alternative system development charge calculation shall be submitted by the applicant for the proposed development and shall be prepared and certified as accurate by persons accepted by the city as qualified professionals in the field of expertise for the water and wastewater facilities, and shall be submitted to the city manager. 
(d)  If the city manager determines that the alternative charge calculation is acceptable, and the city's cost to accommodate the proposed development is substantially different than the system established pursuant to this article, the amount of the system development charges shall be reduced to a dollar amount consistent with the amount determined by the alternative charge calculation. 
(e)  In the event the applicant disagrees with a decision of the city manager that effectively results in a denial of the alternative charge calculation, the applicant may file a written appeal petition with the city council not later than 30 days after receipt of notice of such a decision by the city manager. In reviewing the decision, the city council shall use the standards established herein. The appeal petition must advise the city council of all issues and shall explain the precise basis the applicant asserts that the decision(s) of the city manager is/are alleged to be incorrect.

The official, after a hearing, shall make a determination as to whether a parking violation has been committed and upon finding that the violation has occurred, shall impose the applicable fine in this section as a civil penalty, plus court or hearing costs, and the surcharge in this section. Any person who fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed by the city manager, a designated official, or court, is deemed to have been convicted of a parking ticket violation, and the city manager, designated official or court shall take appropriate measures to enforce collection of the fine. 
(j)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, or general law, all money received by the clerk of the county court as a result of parking citations issued by the city shall be paid to the city as provided by general law. 
(k)  At any hearing of the case involving illegal parking in which the owner of said vehicle is being tried under this article, it shall be sufficient evidence upon which the court may rely to establish the name of the registered owner of such vehicle if a parking enforcement officer shall state under oath that the officer has made inquiry of the department of highway safety and motor vehicles or office of the county tax collector and has been advised by them of the identity of such registered owner. Otherwise, the court may defer the final determination of such case until a certified record or appropriate certificate can be obtained from the office of the department of highway safety and motor vehicles or the county tax collector's office indicating the registered owner of the vehicle on the date in question.

(a)  It is unlawful for any person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle within, or to obstruct, any such specially designated and marked parking space provided in accordance with F.S. § 553.5041, unless the vehicle displays a disabled parking permit issued under F.S. §§ 316.1958 or 320.0848 or a license plate issued under F.S. §§ 320.084, 320.0842, 320.0843, or 320.0845, and the vehicle is transporting the person to whom the displayed permit is issued. The violation may not be dismissed for failure of the marking on the parking space to comply with [F.S.] § 553.5041 if the space is in general compliance and is clearly distinguishable as a designated accessible parking space for people who have disabilities. Only a warning may be issued for unlawfully parking in a space designated for persons with disabilities if there is no above-grade sign as provided in F.S. § 553.5041. 
(1)  Whenever a parking enforcement officer, or the owner or lessee of the space finds a vehicle in violation of this subsection, that officer, owner, or lessor shall have the vehicle in violation removed to any lawful parking space or facility or require the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle immediately to remove the unauthorized vehicle from the parking space. Whenever any vehicle is removed under this section to a storage lot, garage, or other safe parking space, the cost of the removal and parking constitutes a lien against the vehicle. 
(2)  The officer shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle with a violation of this section. The owner of a leased vehicle is not responsible for a violation of this section if the vehicle is registered in the name of the lessee. 
(3)  All convictions for violations of this section must be reported to the department of highway safety and motor vehicles. 
(4)  A parking enforcement officer has the right to demand to be shown the person's disabled parking permit and driver's license or state identification card when investigating the possibility of a violation of this section. If such a request is refused, the person in charge of the vehicle may be charged with resisting an officer without violence, as provided in [F.S.] § 843.02. 
(b)  It is unlawful for any person to obstruct the path of travel to an accessible parking space, curb cut, or access aisle by standing or parking a vehicle within any such designated area. The violator is subject to the same penalties as are imposed for illegally parking in a space that is designated as an accessible parking space for persons who have disabilities. 
(c)  Any person who is chauffeuring a person who has a disability is allowed, without need for a disabled parking permit or a special license plate, to stand temporarily in any such parking space, for the purpose of loading or unloading the person who has a disability. A penalty may not be imposed upon the driver for such temporary standing. 
(d)  (1)  A vehicle that is transporting a person who has a disability and that has been granted a permit under F.S. § 320.0848(1)(a), may be parked for a maximum of 30 minutes in any parking space reserved for persons who have disabilities. 
(2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1), a theme park or an entertainment complex as defined in F.S. § 509.013(9), which provides parking in designated areas for persons who have disabilities, may allow any vehicle that is transporting a person who has a disability to remain parked in a space reserved for persons who have disabilities throughout the period the theme park is open to the public for that day.

    Motor vehicles displaying a special license plate or parking permit issued to a person who has a disability by any other state or district subject to the laws of the United States or by a foreign country that issues disabled parking permits that display the international symbol of accessibility are recognized as displaying a valid license plate or permit, that allows such a vehicle special parking privileges under F.S. § 316.1955, and section 36-100 of this Code, if the other state or district grants reciprocal recognition for residents of this state who have disabilities. However, when an individual is required by law to have a Florida driver's license or a Florida vehicle registration, a special motor vehicle license plate or parking permit issued by another state, district, or country to persons who have disabilities is not valid and the individual whose vehicle displays such an invalid plate or permit is subject to the same penalty as an individual whose vehicle does not display a valid plate or permit. A parking enforcement officer may not ticket a vehicle for a violation of F.S. § 316.1955, or this Code, without first determining whether the vehicle is transporting a resident of another state who is the owner of the out-of-state placard.

(b)  The driver of a vehicle that is parked as provided in subsection (a) may not be penalized for parking, except in clearly defined bus loading zones, fire lanes, or access aisles adjacent to the parking spaces for persons who have disabilities, or in areas posted as "No Parking" zones or as emergency vehicle zones, or for parking in excess of the posted time limits. 
(c)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), when a state, county, or municipal parking facility or lot is being used in connection with an event at a convention center, cruise-port terminal, sports stadium, sports arena, coliseum, or auditorium, the parking facility may charge a person whose vehicle displays such a parking permit a parking fee in the same manner and amount as it charges other persons. 
(d)  A parking facility that restricts the number of consecutive days that a vehicle may be parked may impose that same restriction on a vehicle that displays a disabled parking permit issued to a person who has a disability. 
(e)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), when an on-street parking meter restricts the duration of time that a vehicle may be parked, a vehicle properly displaying a disabled parking permit is allowed a maximum of four hours at no charge. 
(f)  A parking facility that leases a parking space for a duration that exceeds one week is not required to reduce the fee for a lessee who is disabled. 
(g)  An airport that owns, operates, or leases parking facilities, or any other parking facilities that are used for the purpose of air travel, may charge for parking vehicles that display a disabled parking permit or license tag issued under F.S. §§ 316.1958, 320.084, 320.0842, 320.0843, 320.0845, or 320.0848. However, the governing body of each publicly owned or publicly operated airport must grant free parking to any vehicle with specialized equipment, such as ramps, lifts, or foot or hand controls, or for utilization by a person who has a disability or whose vehicle is displaying the Florida toll exemption permit. 
(h)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), the city may charge for parking in a facility or lot that provides timed parking spaces for any vehicle that displays a disabled parking permit, except that any vehicle with specialized equipment, such as ramps, lifts, or foot or hand controls, for use by a person who has a disability, or any vehicle that is displaying the Florida toll exemption permit, is exempt from any parking fees.

(Ord. No. 17-13971 , § 1, 6-7-2017) 
Sec. 38-106. - Protection of city trees. 
(a)  Requirements for utility pruning. Utilities must conform to current ANSI A300 standards when performing line clearing work in canopy street zones to balance the requirement to preserve the canopy and maintain safe, reliable electric service. 
(1)  Franchised utilities must notify the department by e-mail or mail 30 business days prior to any maintenance utility line clearing work in canopy streets. 
(2)  Franchised utilities must have an ISA certified arborist directing the pruning of trees in a canopy street. 
(3)  Utility pruning should only provide minimum safe clearance to protect energized power lines with consideration for the combined movement of the conductors near trees in severe weather, the species of the tree, and the voltage of the conductor. 
(4)  The city recognizes that Florida Power and Light (FPL) has a right and responsibility, as provided by Florida State Statute and Electric Tariff Rules, to clear vegetation away from power lines in order to ensure the safe transmission of electricity to customers and the above-listed provisions are intended to be cooperative efforts between the city and FPL. This section does not apply to the extent preempted by F.S § 163.3209. 
(b)  Location of city trees. All city trees that may be disturbed by proposed activities shall be physically located on-site and shown on the site plan submitted for any project or site development and as a part of the tree removal request in the tree alteration permit application process. 
(c)  Drip line preservation. During development, construction activity, and utility construction, the critical root zone of a city tree shall be protected from activities that may disturb or injure the tree (such as cut and fill activities, building pad placements, road bed construction, construction material storage, driving or parking of equipment, trenching, etc.). The permit applicant may provide specific arboricultural analysis to demonstrate that there is no likelihood of adverse impact to a city tree; however, the department shall make the sole determination of where tree protection barriers shall be placed around a tree. 
(d)  Canopy and root pruning. When activities disturb the area within the drip line of a city tree, or when pruning must be performed on the crown of a city tree, the following arboricultural techniques are required: 
(1)  When the tree roots within the drip line may be disturbed, the affected roots must be severed by clean pruning cuts where the activity impacts the roots. Root pruning shall be completed by an ISA certified arborist. Roots can be pruned by utilizing trenching equipment that is specifically designed for this purpose or by hand digging a trench and pruning roots with a chain saw, pruning saw or other equipment designed for tree pruning. Roots within the drip line must be pruned to a depth of 12 inches below existing grade or to the depth of the disturbance if less than 12 inches from the existing grade. When underground utilities are to be installed through the drip line, root pruning requirements may be waived if the lines are installed via tunneling or directional boring as opposed to trenching. 
(2)  All pruning of protected trees shall conform to the current ANSI A300 standards and be completed by an ISA certified arborist. There shall be no stub cuts, or lions-tailing of the crown of the tree. 
(3)  It shall be a violation of this section to perform the techniques of topping or other pruning techniques that remove the vertical leader stems or other pruning that results in an unnecessary reduction of shade of protected trees in the permit area. 
(e)  Tree protection barrier requirements. During development activities or any other potential disturbance that will impact the area within the drip line of any city tree, protective barriers shall be placed around each city tree, by the applicant, to prevent the destruction or damaging of roots, stems, or crowns of such trees. Barriers shall remain in place and intact until the work is completed, however, barriers may be removed temporarily to accommodate construction needs, provided the city approves the temporary removal in writing and that the manner and purpose for such temporary removal will not harm the tree. The city reserves the right to deny the temporary removal of tree protection barriers. The following are the minimum requirements for protective barriers: 
(1)  Protective posts shall be placed so as to protect all areas within the drip line boundary for each city tree affected, except in right-of-way or utility placement areas where space to install the barricade may be limited, posts may be placed so as to protect a minimum of 50 percent of the area within the drip line approved by the city manager. 
(2)  Posts shall be a minimum of two inches by four inches, or larger, wooden post, two-inch outer diameter or larger or other post material of equivalent size; shall be connected with a minimum of at least a one inch by four inches wooden board rail; and shall be clearly flagged. The maximum distance allowed between upright posts is eight feet. Wooden posts and boards shall be painted forest green once installed. 
(3)  Posts shall be implanted deep enough into the ground to be stable and extend a minimum height of four feet above the ground. 
(4)  Where development activity is permitted within 50 percent of the radius within the area of the drip line of a protected tree (as measured by the longest radius from trunk to drip line), the department may require additional tree protection provisions be incorporated in the activity permit. 
(5)  No storage or movement of equipment, material, debris, or fill soil is allowed within the drip line of any city tree. 
(6)  No equipment shall be cleaned, or waste materials such as paints, oils, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, or any other material shall be stored, within the drip line of any city tree. 
(7)  No damaging wires, signs or permits shall be fastened to any city tree unless approved by the department. 
(8)  Silt barriers, hay bales, or similar effective erosion silt control barriers shall be required in any area where erosion or siltation may cause damage to city trees as determined solely by the department. 
(9)  When elevation changes are proposed within the drip line of any city tree, the applicant shall be required to install retaining walls or drain tiles. The applicant shall have the choice of the type or design. These root protection measures shall be in place prior to the deposition of fill, or excavation of soil from the drip line. 
(10)  Should a private party conduct work within the drip line of a city tree and fail to install the required tree protection barrier, the city reserves the right to install the required tree protection barrier and charge the private party conducting the work for the city's materials and labor associated with the installing of the barricade. A sample tree protection barricade is set out below. 

(f)  Inspections. The department shall conduct periodic inspections of the site during the permitted activity in order to ensure compliance with this section. 
(g)  The city manager is authorized to allow a variation from the strict requirements of this section where an equivalent or superior method of preserving a tree is clearly demonstrated. 
(Ord. No. 17-13971 , § 1, 6-7-2017)

    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be punishable as provided in section 1-15, and in addition to or in the alternative: 
(1)  The city manager may, unless otherwise prohibited by law, withhold the issuance of any required certificate of occupancy, permit or inspection on any property until the provisions of this chapter, including all conditions of any permits issued under this chapter, have been complied with. 
(2)  The city manager may issue a stop work order to any person, firm, owner, contractor or agent performing construction work upon the property upon which a protected tree is located. 
(3)  The city manager may issue a stop work order to any person, firm, owner, contractor or agent performing any work on a city tree or upon the critical root zone of a city tree which violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter. 
(4)  The city manager may prosecute criminally if the violation is found to be willful or intentional or where the violator ignores or disobeys a stop work order or an order to treat or remove a lethally diseased tree or an order to cease and desist from selling or installing unpermitted or diseased trees. 
(5)  Each individual city tree or protected tree unlawfully altered or caused to die shall constitute a separate offense. 
(6)  Each day of violation is a separate offense. 
(7)  Each individual city tree or protected unlawfully altered or caused to die is presumed to be an irreparable or irreversible harm. 
(8)  The city manager may order mitigation. If any city tree, not meeting the removal criteria provided in this chapter, has been removed in violation of the provisions of this chapter, said tree shall be replaced on a caliper inch-for-inch basis. The term "inch-for-inch" means that for each caliper inch of tree improperly removed or destroyed, replacement trees having the minimum replacement tree size described in this chapter shall be required and the total caliper in inches of all replacement trees shall equal or exceed the combined caliper inches of all trees improperly removed. If the applicant can demonstrate that the planting of replacement trees on a property would be impractical due to the existence of other trees of a species protected by this chapter within 30 feet of all available land for the planting of trees on said property, the number of replacement trees may be reduced, and the applicant shall be required to pay to the city tree bank account the sum of $200.00 for each inch of caliper of those replacement trees that are not required to be planted as a result. Additionally, for each tree improperly removed, a fine of $500.00 shall be deposited into the tree bank account. If a permit was not obtained as required pursuant to this chapter, the city may issue a stop work order until the required permit has been issued, and the fee for same shall be $100.00. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize the commencement of any tree work under this chapter without required permit for same. 
(9)  In addition to the remedies provided in this section, this chapter may be enforced as otherwise provided in this Code for the enforcement of any code violation. 
(10)  The violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(11)  Additionally, the city may take such other lawful action in any court of competent jurisdiction as it is necessary to prevent, remedy or abate any violation, noncompliance or nuisance. Such other lawful actions shall include, but shall not be limited to, an equitable action for injunctive relief or an action at law for damages.

The office of the city attorney shall be authorized to take all steps legally necessary to protect and defend the public right of access and use declared by this Code.

Chapter 44 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 44-1. - Title. 
    This code shall be known as and may be referred to as the "City of Naples Land Development Code," and may also be referred to as the "land development code." 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 1-1; Code 1994, § 82-1) 
Sec. 44-2. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  This land development code contains standards intended to ensure that neighbors and adjacent and neighboring properties are protected from potential negative impacts in developing and using a parcel of land. This land development code also contains standards intended to preserve and protect the health, safety and general welfare of the community. In addition, it is the intent of the land development code to protect the character and property values of the city, to protect the assets of the city and their economic value as it relates to the city as a tourist-oriented community, and to maintain and enhance the attractive nature of the city. 
(b)  As required by F.S. § 163.3202, this land development code contains specific and detailed provisions necessary or desirable to implement the adopted city comprehensive plan and regulates the subdivision of land, the use of land and water, signage, stormwater management and environmentally sensitive lands. The land development code also provides for the protection of potable water wellfields and ensures that public facilities and services meet or exceed the standards established in the capital improvement element of the comprehensive plan. In addition, the concurrency management system requires that proposed development is conditioned on the availability of public facilities and services. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 1-2; Code 1994, § 82-2) 
Sec. 44-3. - Relationship to existing regulations. 
    To the extent that the provisions of this land development code are the same in substance as the previously adopted provisions that they replace in the city's Code of Ordinances, including the zoning and subdivision ordinances, they shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments unless otherwise specifically provided. In particular, a situation that did not constitute a lawful nonconforming situation under the previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this land development code merely by the repeal of the zoning ordinance. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 1-3; Code 1994, § 82-3) 
Sec. 44-4. - Interpretation. 
(a)  In the interpretation and application of this land development code, all provisions shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(b)  No use, structure, condition or development shall exist upon any property unless permitted in its district and location pursuant to this code or by applicable general law. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 1-4; Code 1994, § 82-4; Ord. No. 08-12308, § 1, 12-17-2008) 
Sec. 44-5. - Effect on existing covenants and restrictions; conflicting regulations. 
    This land development code is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this land development code conflicts or overlaps with other regulations, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall apply. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 1-5; Code 1994, § 82-5) 
Sec. 44-6. - Severability. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this land development code are severable, and, if any such section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases of this land development code, since such provisions would have been enacted without the incorporation into this land development code of such unconstitutional or invalid section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 1-6; Code 1994, § 82-6) 
Sec. 44-7. - Rules of construction generally. 
    For the purpose of this land development code, words used in the present tense shall include the future. The singular number shall include the plural, and the plural the singular.

In timeshare lodging facilities, each unit may contain living and sleeping accommodations, sanitary facilities and kitchen or cooking facilities. Timeshare lodging, interval ownership, interval occupancy and similar uses shall be construed to be the same. The city council finds that timeshare lodging is distinguished from transient lodging in that: 
(1)  Occupancy is usually for weekly periods of time or longer. 
(2)  The units are not primarily intended for rent to the public. 
(3)  The units are usually larger in size than traditional hotel or motel units, and may be subject to a greater intensity of human occupancy. 
(4)  The facility is normally subject to a higher occupancy rate. 
(5)  Each unit typically includes complete living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation facilities. 
(6)  The facility and neighboring properties are subject to unique impacts as a result of marketing activities. 
(7)  The management characteristics have the potential of being substantially different from those of transient lodging facilities. 
(8)  Ownership is diffused rather than concentrated. 
(9)  Occupancy is not intended for the overnight tourist or traveler. 
(10)  Recreation facilities are usually more extensive and used more intensely. 
The distinguishing features listed in this definition are not intended to be all-inclusive. 
    Trail means Tamiami Trail-U.S. 41. 
    Transient lodging facility means a hotel, motel, motor lodge, tourist court, or similar building or group of buildings in which sleeping accommodations and sanitary facilities are offered to the public and intended for rental to transients with daily, weekly or seasonal charge. A transient lodging facility includes a unit, group of units, dwelling, building, or group of buildings, within a single complex of buildings rented to guests more than three times in a calendar year for periods of less than 30 days or one calendar month, whichever is less; or which is advertised or held out to the public as a place regularly rented to guests for periods of less than 30 days or one calendar month, whichever is less. It does not include condominium common elements. A transient lodging facility is distinguished from multifamily dwellings (such as apartments) where rentals are for periods of a month or longer and occupancy is by residents rather than transients. 
    Type of school means schools providing the same level of education, i.e. elementary, middle, high school, or other combination of grade levels. 
    Upland conservation area means native vegetation area consisting of pine and scrub oak communities. 
    Upland vegetation includes disturbed wetland sites, primarily Australian pine and palmetto areas. 
    Vegetative communities means ecological communities based on certain soils, vegetation and animals, i.e., coastal strands, oak hammocks and cypress swamps. 
    Vital areas is a land use designation which includes marine grass beds, tidal swamps and marsh areas, fresh water swamps and marsh areas, gulf beaches and dunes, and class II waters. 
    Water accelator means a process to soften water with the use of chemicals. 
    Water-dependent means development directly carried out on, in or adjacent to a body of water; usage requires access to water. 
    Water recharge areas means land or water areas through which groundwater is replenished. 
    Water-related means developments or activities not directly dependent on water access, which may provide goods and services associated with water-dependent uses. All motels and hotels within the city are considered water-related due to their proximity to the beach or bay. 
    Water resource means any and all water on or beneath the surface of the ground, including natural or artificial watercourses, lakes, ponds or diffused surface water, and water percolating, standing or flowing beneath the surface of the ground. 
    Water well area means the location of city water wells used for potable water consumption activities. 
    Wellfield means an area consisting of several water well sites which is used for extracting water out of the ground. 
    Xeriscape means drought-resistant or drought-tolerant landscaping. 
    Yard. 
(1)  Generally. Front, rear and side yards are identified as follows: 
a.  A yard which abuts a street or the gulf is a front yard. 
b.  All navigable waterfront yards other than gulf-front are rear yards. 
c.  All yards which abut an alley and are parallel to the front yard are rear yards. In the event of a lot which has more than one alley abutting it, the city manager shall determine which yard shall be the rear and side yards. 
d.  Rear yards, other than as described in subsections (1)a through c of this definition, occur only in the interior of a block and are parallel or nearly parallel to the front yard. 
e.  Yards, other than those described in subsections (1)a through c of this definition, which are perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to a front yard are side yards. 
(2)  Corner and double-frontage lots. Corner lots and double-frontage lots which are not on an alley and are not on navigable waters have two front yards, two side yards and no rear yards. A lot encircled by streets has only front yards. 
(3)  Irregular lot shapes. In the event of irregular lot shapes, or on double-frontage lots, for the purpose of determining permitted fence heights, the city manager shall determine yard locations which shall as closely approximate the rules set out in this definition as is practical. 
(4)  Sketch identifying typical yards. The sketch following this section illustrates a variety of lot types and indicates which are front, side and rear yards.

Sec. 46-33. - Site plan review and site plan with deviations. 
(a)  Intent. The site plan review process shall provide for the administrative review of new multiple family or non-residential projects in the city according to the building code, fire safety code, Land Development Code and other applicable regulations administered by the city prior to the submission of plans for building permit review or other zoning petitions except design review. 
(b)  Applicability. Site plan approval is required prior to and as a prerequisite for the issuance of a building permit for any of the following located in any non-residential zoning district or multifamily zoning district: 
(1)  A new principal building or structure; 
(2)  An addition to an existing structure that is greater than 1,000 square feet; or 
(3)  Landscaping, lighting, paving and restriping projects exceeding 10,000 square feet. 
(4)  Single-family residences and structures located in single-family residential districts are excluded from this division. 
(c)  The required contents of the submittal shall be determined by the city and published with the site plan petition forms. Required contents may include all documents deemed necessary for the thorough review of the project for compliance with applicable regulations. 
(d)  Petitions shall be reviewed and approved, approved with conditions or denied within 60 days of submittal. Petitions for site plan review may be submitted simultaneously with other zoning petitions. However, other zoning petitions may not be presented to the planning advisory board or city council prior to receiving site plan approval, when required. The city council shall have final review and approval authority for site plans and amendments to site plans for development within a PD, planned development. 
(e)  No certificate of occupancy or final building inspection approval, for any property described in this division, shall be issued until such construction has been found to be in conformity with the approved plans. 
(f)  Standards for review. The purpose of site plan review is to: 
(1)  Determine the impact of the project on level of service standards and consistency with the comprehensive plan, code and applicable regulations. 
(2)  Encourage logic, imagination, innovation and variety in the design process. 
(3)  Make certain that the proposed development is compatible with its surrounding area. 
(4)  Ensure appropriate planning and to require the necessary improvements with respect to: 
a.  Vehicular entry and exit drives. 
b.  On-site vehicular circulation. 
c.  Accessways for emergency and service vehicles. 
d.  The impact of traffic generated by the project on traffic patterns and volumes on adjoining and nearby streets and the adequacy of such streets to accommodate such traffic. 
e.  The adequacy of public utilities. 
f.  The adequacy of buffers between the project and adjoining dissimilar uses. 
g.  Off-site improvements necessitated by the traffic or other aspects of the proposed project. 
(g)  Site plan with deviations. Where a site plan complies with the zoning requirements relative to density, permitted and conditional uses and is consistent with the comprehensive plan but departs from the zoning district's dimensional requirements, the site plan may be forwarded to the city council for approval of a site plan with deviations. As part of the site plan with deviation approval, the city council may grant conditional use permit approval provided that the proposed development meets the standards for conditional use permit approval. 
(1)  Procedures and notice. Following the completion and administrative review of a site plan pursuant to this section, the petitioner may submit a petition for a site plan with deviations which shall be reviewed according to the following procedures: 
a.  The application and required exhibits submitted pursuant to this division shall be reviewed as to form and informational content. 
b.  A recommendation shall be prepared and presented with the applicant's petition to the planning advisory board at a public hearing, within 44 days of receipt of a complete petition.

d.  The city manager shall notify owners, as they appear in the tax collector's tax rolls, of property located within 500 feet of the outer limit of the property described in the petition, by regular mail at least 14 days prior to the meeting of the planning advisory board at which the petition is to be considered. However, failure to notify all owners of property located within 500 feet by mail through inadvertence will not render the hearing void as long as other public notice requirements have been met. 
e.  The city council shall hear the petition, in accordance with procedures for quasi-judicial proceedings, and take final action by resolution. At the public hearing the city council shall consider the staff report, the recommendations of the planning advisory board, any other relevant testimony and evidence and review the petition according to the standards for approval. 
(2)  Standards for approval. Petitions for site plans with deviations shall be reviewed for consistency with the following standards:

b.  The development shall comply with applicable city plans and planning policies, and shall have a beneficial effect both upon the area of the city in which it is proposed to be established and upon the city as a whole. 
c.  The total land area within the development and the area devoted to each functional portion of the development shall be adequate to serve its intended purpose. 
d.  Streets, utilities, drainage facilities, recreation areas, building heights, sizes and yards, and vehicular parking and loading facilities shall be appropriate for the particular use involved. 
e.  Visual character and community amenities shall be equal or better in quality than that required by the development standards for the district. 
f.  Areas proposed for common ownership shall be subject to a reliable and continuing maintenance guarantee. 
g.  Deviations shall be clearly delineated in the petition and shall be the minimum required to achieve the goals of the project and comply with these standards. 
h.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Time limits. The following time limitations shall apply to site plans with deviations: 
a.  Upon the effective date of a resolution approving a site plan with deviations, construction shall commence within 48 months. "Construction," for purposes of this section, shall mean obtaining a building permit for a structure or structures authorized in the approved consolidated development plan and initiating substantial site and structural improvements, not including land clearing, land filling and soil compaction. 
b.  The city manager may grant a one-year extension of the commencement date upon a determination that plans have been submitted for building permit review, prior to the commencement date, which substantially match the approved site plan documents. Thereafter, the city council, by resolution, may grant a one-year extension of the commencement date upon a determination that a good faith effort to commence construction has been made. 
(4)  Amendments. Minor changes to the site plan with deviations approved by city council may be approved administratively provided that these changes meet code, comply with the conditions imposed by city council and do not consist of increases in floor area of greater than ten percent. Minor changes cannot increase or extend the aspect of the project that deviates from the Code. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 3-82; Code 1994, § 86-202; Ord. No. 95-7594, § 4, 12-20-1995; Ord. No. 99-8615, § 3, 9-1-1999; Ord. No. 01-9126, § 1, 3-21-2001; Ord. No. 08-12280, § 2, 12-3-2008; Ord. No. 19-14322 , § 3, 4-3-2019) 
Sec. 46-34. - Approval of conditional uses. 
(a)  Conditional use defined; time limits; conformance with approved plans. A conditional use is a use that would not be appropriate generally or without restriction throughout a particular zoning district, but may, if controlled as to number, area, location and relation to the neighborhood and based upon the design and character of a particular development proposal, be appropriate. Any conditional use granted by the city council shall expire 12 months after the date of approval of such conditional use unless a building permit based upon and incorporating the conditional use is issued within the 12-month period, or, if a building permit is not required, the expiration date shall be 12 months from the date of approval if by that date the use for which the conditional use was granted has not been commenced. An approved conditional use which ceases operation for a period of 12 months shall expire. In either event, the petitioner may appeal to the city council for an extension of time. A conditional use, as approved by the city council, may be expanded unless specifically conditioned otherwise, and permitted uses may be added to the property, as long as all expansions meet the requirements of the Land Development Code and do not expand the parcel of property as described in the resolution approved by the city council for the conditional use. In addition, the city manager must determine, after a review of the guidelines and standards listed in subsection (d) of this section, that no changes are being made to the site plan which would adversely affect the project or surrounding neighborhood. For uses which are not dependent upon the issuance of a building permit, a conditional use is valid for the petitioner only. An approved conditional use may be revoked at any time by city council under the guidelines of subsection (e) of this section, upon making a finding that the operation of the conditional use has resulted in the violation of city ordinance or in the violation of the conditions of approval of the conditional use. 
(b)  Method of approval. Conditional uses listed in a particular zoning district may be permitted by resolution of the city council after an application for such conditional use has been submitted to the planning advisory board and after a duly authorized public hearing on the question has been held and the planning advisory board has voted to recommend approval or disapproval. 
(c)  Review and approval procedure. 
(1)  Conditional use petitions may be obtained at the city offices and may be initiated by the owner of the subject property or the owner's designated representative. This petition must be completed and returned to the city manager, along with the required fee and the necessary supportive materials as required by the city manager, including a development and site plan, at least 44 days prior to the planning advisory board meeting at which the petition is to be considered. Petitions received later than 44 days in advance of any scheduled board meeting will be placed on the agenda of the next meeting. 
(2)  The city manager shall review the petition, and if it determines the petition to be in order, notice of public hearing before the planning advisory board shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 15 days prior to the public hearing, setting forth the date, time and place that the petition will be considered by the planning advisory board. 
(3)  The completed petition shall be circulated by the city manager to various department heads, as applicable. The department head or the department head's designee shall carefully consider whether or not the specific rules governing district and supplementary district regulations relative to the department head's specific areas of responsibility have been met, and shall carefully consider the guidelines or standards for conditional uses where applicable. Each department head shall make written comments and recommendations, and shall include the reasons therefor. 
(4)  Prior to the public hearing, the city manager shall notify owners of property located within 500 feet of the subject site, informing them of the date, time, place and reason for the public hearing. In addition, the city manager shall place a sign in a prominently visible location on the subject property which contains information as to the date, time, place and reason for the hearing. Failure to notify all owners of property within 500 feet of the subject site shall not render the hearing void. 
(5)  At the public hearing, the planning advisory board shall hear the petitioner or the petitioner's designated representative and all other interested parties who appear and request that they be heard, shall consider the recommendation of the department heads, and shall consider the standards or guidelines set out in subsection (d) of this section. As soon as practicable after the public hearing, the board shall submit its recommendation to the city council, in writing, together with the minutes of the hearing, whether to approve, disapprove or approve the conditional use with conditions. 
(6)  After consideration of the recommendation of the planning advisory board, and after the petitioner has been given an opportunity to be heard, and only after making a specific finding that the standards or guidelines set out in subsection (d) of this section have been met, the city council may, by a majority vote of the members present and voting, and by resolution, grant or deny the conditional use or grant it conditional upon such alternate and additional restrictions, stipulations and safeguards as may be deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance. Such conditions, when required by the city council, shall be made a part of the conditional use. Violation of such conditions which are made a part of the terms under which the conditional use is granted shall be considered a violation of this Land Development Code. Conditions in addition to those imposed by the planning advisory board may be imposed by the city council. The planning advisory board and the city council shall cite their reasons in accordance with the guidelines or standards set out in subsection (d) of this section for granting, denying or conditioning the conditional use request. 
(7)  The city council reserves the right to require a model or other visualization before approval of any conditional use. 
(d)  Standards for approval. In its deliberations concerning the granting of a conditional use, the planning advisory board and the city council shall carefully consider the following guidelines and standards: 
(1)  Ingress and egress to the subject property and the proposed structures thereon, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic generation flow and control, and access in case of fire or catastrophe, shall be adequate and not potentially detrimental to existing or anticipated uses in the vicinity and particularly not detrimental to property immediately adjacent to the subject site. 
(2)  Off-street parking and loading areas, where required or requested by the property owner, shall be adequate and well-designed, and relate well, in terms of proximity, access and the like, to the uses intended to be serviced, with particular attention to the items listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section and the smoke, noise, glare, dust, vibrations, fumes, pollution or odor effects related to the vehicular use area or the conditional use, and such shall not be detrimental to the adjoining properties in the general area. 
(3)  Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items listed in subsections (d)(1) and (2) of this section, shall be adequately screened so as not to be visible from adjacent properties or a public right-of-way and shall be located in such a way as not to be a nuisance, by virtue of smoke, noise, glare and the like, to adjacent properties. 
(4)  Utilities, whether public or private, shall be adequate and not detrimental with reference to location, availability, adequacy and compatibility. 
(5)  Screening, buffering or separation of any nuisance or hazardous feature, with reference to type, dimensions and character, shall be fully and clearly represented on the submitted plans and shall be adequate to protect adjacent properties. 
(6)  Proposed signs and exterior lighting shall be considered with reference to glare, traffic safety and compatibility and harmony with surrounding properties and shall be determined to be adequate, safe and not detrimental or a nuisance to adjacent properties. 
(7)  A determination shall be made that the proposed development will not hinder development of the nearby vacant properties with a permitted use in the subject zone district. 
(8)  The land and buildings which are involved shall be adequate, in terms of size, shape, type of building and the like, to ensure compatibility with the proposed conditional use. 
(9)  The proposed development shall be compatible and appropriate with respect to adjacent properties and other property in the district and geographic area. 
(10)  The collective impact of similar non-residential conditional uses shall not result in a single service district or have a negative effect on adjacent property values. 
(e)  Revocation procedures for conditional uses that are not dependent upon the issuance of a building permit. City council may revoke a previously approved conditional use upon making the following findings in a public hearing: 
(1)  The operation of the conditional use has resulted in a violation of city ordinance or the conditions upon which the conditional use was approved, as substantiated by a ruling of the code enforcement board under the guidelines of chapter 2, article VII; or 
(2)  The operation of the conditional use has proven to be detrimental to the general welfare of the residents of the city.

Sec. 46-35. - Expanding, enlarging or changing a nonconformity. 
(a)  Nonconformity defined; continuation generally. 
(1)  A nonconformity is a lot, structure or use of land, or any combination thereof, which was lawful before government action but no longer meets the regulations contained in this Land Development Code because of said government action. Government action includes, but is not limited to: 
a.  An ordinance amendment; 
b.  A "use permitted" which is changed to a conditional use or a use that is no longer a permitted use; 
c.  Annexation; 
d.  Rezoning; or 
e.  condemnation of land for the public benefit. 
(2)  Except when other provisions of this Land Development Code specifically require elimination of nonconformities, a nonconformity may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this section. Repairs, maintenance and improvements on nonconformities may be carried out provided that such work does not increase the nonconforming aspect and does not conflict with the requirements of this section. 
(3)  Nothing in this section shall eliminate required compliance with applicable laws or ordinances relative to the safety and sanitation of a building occupied by a nonconforming use. 
(4)  If any nonconformity is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, explosion, collapse, wind or other like catastrophe it may be replaced to the density, height, parking, landscaping, and setback conditions which existed at the time of the catastrophe, provided that permits for the rebuilding are issued within one year of the catastrophe unless an extension of time has been approved by the city council. The burden of proof of the catastrophic conditions of the property rests with the property owner. Other applicable city, state, and federal regulations must be met in replacements proposed under this section. 
(5)  If for any reason a nonconforming use of land or of a structure ceases for a period of more than 12 months, the land or structure shall not thereafter be put to a nonconforming use. An affected property or business owner may request the city council to approve up to two six-month extensions of time, which may be granted for good and sufficient cause. 
(6)  Single-family residences: 
a.  Additions to nonconforming single-family residences, housing conforming uses, shall be permitted if the addition complies fully with setback and all other applicable regulations. 
b.  If a lot contains both a principal residence and a guest unit which is deemed nonconforming, the principal residence may be demolished and rebuilt while retaining the right to the guest unit, provided that the demolition permit is issued simultaneously with a building permit for the construction of a new principal residence and said building permit does not expire. All requirements of section 56-91 (guest units) shall remain in effect. 
(7)  Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Land Development Code, any nonconforming lot of record which was in single and separate ownership on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this Land Development Code is derived, or amendment which made the lot of record nonconforming, may be used as permitted by the district regulations of the zone in which the lot is located. This provision shall apply even though such lot of record fails to meet the requirements for width or area, or both, that are generally applicable to it, provided that all yards and other requirements not involving area of width of lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which the lot of record is located. 
(8)  When two or more contiguous, vacant, nonconforming lots of record are in single ownership so as to form a single parcel, it may be divided and sold separately only if such division will result in parcels which meet the requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. 
(9)  Any nonconformity which becomes conforming shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconformity. 
(b)  Method of approval. Except as otherwise provided by this section, no nonconformity shall be expanded, enlarged or changed to a different nonconformity except upon recommendation of the planning advisory board, after a public hearing with due public notice, and approval of the city council. The city manager shall notify owners of property located within 500 feet of the property involved in the petition, informing them of the date, time, place and reason for the public hearing. Failure to notify all owners of property located within 500 feet by mail will not render any action taken on such petition void. Action on nonconformity petitions may be taken by resolution adopted by a majority vote of the councilmembers present without a public hearing by the city council, but only after the petitioner has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard. The city council reserves the right to require a model or other visualization before approval of any expansion, enlargement or change in a nonconformity. 
(c)  Site plan; standards for approval. Since the size and nature of the expansion of a nonconformity may vary widely, a site plan and preliminary building plans indicating the proposed expansion or change shall be presented with each request for such expansion or change. Prior to granting an expansion or change of nonconformity, the board and the city council shall ensure that: 
(1)  The expansion, enlargement or change of the nonconformity will not damage the character or quality of the neighborhood in which it is located, or hinder the proper future development of the surrounding properties. 
(2)  Any nuisance feature involved is not increased. 
(3)  Excessive vehicular traffic is not generated on residential streets. 
(4)  An automobile parking or traffic problem is not created. 
(5)  Appropriate drives, walks and buffers are installed. 
(6)  Historic or natural resources are protected. 
    If such insurances are not possible, the requested expansion, enlargement or change shall be denied. 
(d)  Special regulations of seawalls and related structures that are located waterward of platted lots or unplatted parcels are contained in subsection 52-92(d)(11).

Sec. 46-36. - Variances to coastal construction control line. 
(a)  Compliance with state law; exemptions. Any grant of a variance under this section by the city council shall not relieve the applicant from complying with the provisions of F.S. § 161.053. The classes or types of construction activities set forth in subsection 52-33(c) seaward of the coastal construction setback line do not require a variance from the city council, but they must receive a permit in accordance with prescribed procedures from the city manager. 
(b)  Method of approval. The city council may, upon petition of affected riparian upland owners, and after due public notice and hearing, grant a variance to the setback line established in this Land Development Code. The city council shall, within 60 days from the date of the petition, hold a public hearing thereon. A notice of the public hearing shall be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, setting forth the time and place of such hearing. The 60-day requirement set out in this subsection is directory and not mandatory. The city council may, at such hearing, recess or continue the hearing from time to time as is necessary. 
(c)  Review of petitions; contents of petitions. The following procedures shall be followed in the filing and processing of an application for variances to the coastal construction setback lines established by section 52-33: 
(1)  A petition shall be filed with the city manager, and shall be accompanied by a qualified attorney's opinion verifying that the petitioner owns the fee simple title to the property described in the petition. 
(2)  The city manager shall review the petition to determine if the petition is complete and in compliance with the requirements of this Code. Upon determining that the petition is complete and in compliance with this Code, the city manager shall cause notice of public hearing to be advertised in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. 
(3)  If it is determined that the petition is incomplete or insufficient, the petitioner shall be so notified and the petitioner shall be required to submit an amended petition. Notification to the petitioner that the petition is incomplete or insufficient shall stay the 60-day requirement set forth in subsection (b) of this section, and the city council shall, within 60 days from the date of the amended petition, hold a public hearing, after it has been determined that the amended petition is in compliance with this Code. 
(4)  All administrative and advertising costs pertaining to such petitions shall be borne by the petitioner. 
(5)  A petition for a variance from the coastal construction control line shall contain the following: 
a.  A description of the petitioner's property. 
b.  A description of the established setback line from which the petitioner requests a variance. 
c.  A description of the setback line as requested by the petitioner. 
d.  The grounds upon which the petitioner relies for the granting of the requested variance. The petitioner must clearly justify such a variance, and shall show that the effect upon the beach area environment and upland properties and the impact and interaction of the petitioner's proposed construction line will not adversely affect the following factors, natural elements and forces: 
1.  Ground elevations. 
2.  Historical storm and hurricane tides. 
3.  Predicated maximum wave uprush. 
4.  Beach and offshore ground contours. 
5.  Erosion trends. 
6.  Vegetation line. 
7.  Dune and bluff line. 
8.  Building and zoning requirements of the city and other ordinances of the city. 
9.  The master plan of the city. 
The city council reserves the right to require a model or other visualization before approval of any coastal construction control line variance. 
(d)  Standards for approval; maintenance of pedestrian access. 
(1)  No variance shall be granted unless the petitioner shall make an affirmative showing by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner's proposed construction line shall not adversely alter the natural state of the beach area protected by the present setback line; that it shall not accelerate, increase or aggravate natural erosion; that it shall not endanger upland properties; that beach and sand dune erosion shall be controlled; and that it shall not adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Whenever a variance is granted to permit construction which may have the effect of impeding the pedestrian movement of persons on the beach, the petitioner shall provide and maintain improvements which allow pedestrian traffic to cross over or around the facilities. Such improvements shall be maintained in a safe, accessible and stable condition, and the public's right to use of such improvements shall not be obstructed or discouraged by the petitioner or subsequent owners in title. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 3-85; Code 1994, § 86-205(b); Ord. No. 94-7210, § 1, 6-15-1994; Ord. No. 95-7451, §§ 1, 2, 6-7-1995; Ord. No. 95-7594, § 6, 12-20-1995; Ord. No. 97-8046, § 1, 8-20-1997; Ord. No. 99-8454, § 3, 1-20-1999; Ord. No. 99-8515, § 3, 4-7-1999) 
Sec. 46-37. - Variances to zoning requirements. 
(a)  Definition. A variance is a relaxation of the zoning and land development provisions of this Land Development Code where such relaxation will not be contrary to the public interest and where, due to special conditions and circumstances peculiar to the property, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Land Development Code would result in unnecessary and undue hardship, or would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of property. 
(b)  Filing; hearing procedures. 
(1)  A written petition must be submitted to the city manager in a form provided by the city manager demonstrating that the standards for variances as set forth in this section have been or will be met and that the filing fees as provided in the fee schedule have been paid. The petition shall be signed by or consented to in writing by all of the owners of the property for which the variance is requested. Proof of ownership is required. If a representative is designated by the owner the designated representative shall be deemed to have the same authority over the petition as the owner. 
(2)  The city manager shall determine whether the petition is complete and sufficient. To be sufficient, the petition must be complete, accompanied by any required exhibits, and must, on its face, demonstrate that the standards for granting of a variance set out in subsection (c) have been or will be met. If the petition is not sufficient, the city manager shall notify the applicant in writing of the insufficiency within 30 days after submittal. Upon determination that the petition is sufficient, the city manager shall act upon an administrative variance petition as provided in subsection (d) or forward the variance petition to the planning advisory board for public hearing; shall provide public notice as provided in this section and where applicable, in general law; and shall prepare a staff report containing analysis and recommendations. 
(3)  The city manager will also notify owners, as they appear on the tax collector's tax rolls, of property located within 500 feet of the outer limit of the property described in the petition, by regular mail at least 14 days prior to the meeting of the planning advisory board at which the petition is to be considered. However, failure to notify all owners of property located within 500 feet by mail through inadvertence will not render the hearing void as long as other public notice requirements have been met. 
(4)  Petitions will normally be placed on the agenda of the next regular planning advisory board meeting occurring at least 44 days after the petition is found by the city manager to be sufficient. The board shall hear the petition in accordance with procedures for quasi-judicial proceedings and, as soon as practicable after the public hearing, submit to the city council the minutes of the hearing and the board's recommendation in writing that the city council grant the variance with or without conditions, deny the variance, or take other action as is appropriate under the circumstances. 
(5)  Upon receiving the recommendation from the planning advisory board and after providing public notice, the city council shall hear the petition, in accordance with procedures for quasi-judicial proceedings and take final agency action by resolution, which may include granting the variance with or without conditions, denying the variance or taking other action as is appropriate under the circumstances, including without limitation, remanding the petition to the planning advisory board for further hearings. Unless otherwise provided by the city council, the petition will be considered by the city council at a regular or special meeting occurring no sooner than 15, nor later than 35 days after transmittal from the planning advisory board, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable. 
(6)  At the hearing, the city council shall consider the staff report, the recommendations of the planning advisory board and any other relevant testimony and evidence. The city council reserves the right to require a model or other visualization before approval of a variance. The granting of a variance shall only be upon a specific finding that the standards enumerated in subsection (c) have been met. 
(7)  A variance may be granted conditional upon such alternate and additional restrictions, stipulations and safeguards as may be deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the intent and purpose of this Land Development Code. 
(8)  In any variance petition the city council may refer, or authorize the planning advisory board to refer, an petition to a special master for hearing and recommended order in accordance with the provisions of section 46-41. 
(9)  Where an applicant claims that the petition must be granted as a matter of law, such as being due to a vested right, estoppel, a Bert Harris Act or a taking claim, the claim and evidence supporting it must be presented to the planning advisory board, and to the city council, or it is deemed waived. 
(10)  Except as may be clearly provided in general law or in a specific provision of this Land Development Code, variances are not available for the purpose of allowing a use or structure that is not permitted in a district. 
(11)  A variance is not a matter of right. The city council reserves the right to deny a variance for any lawful reason. 
(c)  Variance criteria. 
(1)  General. 
a.  If, upon consideration of the variance criteria set out in this subsection and (c)(2) below, it is determined that the case for approving a variance clearly outweighs the case for denial, the variance may be approved, providing that: 
1.  The variance does not permit the establishment or enlargement of any use or structure devoted to a use which is not permitted in the district in which the variance is requested; 
2.  The variance will be consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Specific. 
a.  Prior to approving, approving with conditions or denying a variance, city council shall consider and determine, based upon substantial competent evidence, the following criteria: 
1.  Whether the plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances not created by the applicant, an agent of the applicant or a predecessor in title of the applicant; 
2.  Whether special conditions or circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land or structure involved, and which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same neighborhood or district; 
3.  Whether the failure to grant the variance would result in unnecessary and undue hardship to the property; 
4.  Whether the failure to grant the variance would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the property; 
5.  Whether the variance will promote, or will not be inimical to, the health, safety and welfare of the community; 
6.  Whether the variance will be otherwise consistent with and in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Land Development Code; 
7.  Whether the variance is the most practical or logical solution to the need for relaxation of the literal requirements of this Land Development Code; 
8.  Whether the variance will be injurious to the surrounding neighborhood or adjacent properties. 
9.  Whether the construction resulting from the variance will be compatible in character and scale with the surrounding neighborhood, preserve natural resources, and preserve historic structures by maintaining the architectural character of the original building in keeping with the period in which it was built. 
(d)  Variances; administrative. 
(1)  Except as may be prohibited by general law, the city manager is authorized to grant administrative variances, upon petition and payment of the filing fees provided in the Fee Schedule, where the deviation from the regulations is minimal, that is, not exceeding ten percent. The city manager shall consider and apply the same standards in considering an administrative variance as would be applied by the planning advisory board and city council. 
(2)  The city manager shall provide prior notice to adjacent property owners when considering petitions to vary residential setbacks, height, and spatial perception; shall provide notice to other owners within 500 feet of the outside limits of the property 30 days prior to making a final determination on the petition; and may refer any administrative variance petition to the planning advisory board and city council. 
(3)  Administrative variances shall only apply to the existing structure, and shall not apply to any reconstruction or future construction on the property. The administrative variance may be recorded with the Collier County Clerk of Court. 
(e)  Violations. In addition to any other penalty provided in this chapter, a violation of any condition of a variance may be a cause for voiding the variance or placing further conditions upon a variance. Such action may be taken by council upon notice to the owner, and hearing.

Sec. 46-38. - Vacation of street, alley, easement or subdivision plat. 
(a)  Method of approval. Following a public hearing, the city council may, in its discretion, by resolution, approve the vacation of a public street, alleyway, dedicated easement or subdivision plat, or portion of plat, if it is determined that there is no present necessity, or reasonably foreseeable necessity, for the retention of the street, alleyway, easement, subdivision plat, or portion of plat, and that the right to convenient access of adjoining property owners will not be affected thereby. 
(b)  Review of petitions. 
(1)  Petitions to vacate any public street, alleyway, dedicated easement, subdivision plat, or portion of plat, either in whole or in part, may be initiated by the city council, the city manager, or by any person affected thereby. 
(2)  Such petitions shall be filed with the city manager, and shall be accompanied by a legal description of the property, easement, or a copy of the plat or portion of plat proposed to be vacated, certified by a land surveyor licensed in the State of Florida. Petitions to vacate any plat, either in whole or in part, shall be accompanied by an attorney's opinion verifying that the person making application for the vacation owns the fee simple title to the whole or part of the tract covered by the plat sought to be vacated. A legal description of all public or private easements shall accompany the petition. 
(3)  A filing and processing fee as set forth in appendix A to this Code shall be borne by the petitioner. 
(4)  The city council shall hold a public hearing to consider the vacation. Notice of the hearing shall be published in accordance with the notice provisions contained in F.S. § 166.041(3)(a). However, where the vacation is also a vacation or annulment of a plat, as provided in F.S. § 177.101, the notice shall be published as required in that section. The city manager shall notify owners of property located within 500 feet of the property involved in the petition, informing them of the date, time, place and reason for the public hearing. Failure to notify all owners of property located within 500 feet by mail will not render any action taken on such petition void. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 3-87; Code 1994, § 86-207; Ord. No. 99-8615, § 5, 9-1-1999; Ord. No. 13-13295, § 1, 6-5-2013 )

A temporary use permit may be cancelled by the building official at any time the terms of the permit are violated. 
(c)  Special event activities. Special event activities shall be defined as, but not limited to, any organized public activities held or conducted on a temporary basis which are apart from, or in addition to, activities and uses normally associated with and permitted at a specific location.

Sec. 46-40. - Enforcement. 
    The administration and enforcement of zoning regulations is as follows: 
(1)  The city manager shall administer, interpret and enforce the zoning ordinance. The city manager may be provided with the assistance of such other persons as the city manager may direct. If the city manager shall find that any of the provisions of this Land Development Code are being violated, the person responsible for such violation shall be notified in writing, indicating the nature of the violation, stating the action necessary to correct it and specifying the time permitted for correction of the violation. The city manager shall require discontinuation of the illegal use of the land, building or structure; removal of illegal structures, additions or alterations; and discontinuance and correction of any illegal work being done; and shall take all other lawful action necessary to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of the zoning ordinance. 
(2)  No land use or structure shall be initiated, erected, moved, added to or structurally altered unless a zoning clearance therefor has been issued if required by the zoning ordinance. 
(3)  All applications for building permits shall include such information as may be required by the city manager. 
(4)  Building permits issued on the basis of faulty permit applications shall be voided by the city manager. 
(5)  When permits are issued through administrative error, the error shall be called to the attention of the permit holder as soon as the error is discovered by the city manager. If the error is not voluntarily corrected, the matter shall be immediately referred to the city council, which shall take such lawful action as is appropriate and necessary. 
(6)  Any building or structure for which there is a valid building permit which was issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this Land Development Code is derived may be constructed and used in accordance with plans and specifications upon which the valid building permit was granted, except that the various sections of this Land Development Code relating to nonconforming buildings and structures and amortization shall apply to all such buildings, structures or permits. 
(7)  Revocation of permits authorized; notice of hearing. 
a.  Any permit or approval issued pursuant to this Land Development Code (or any permit or approval for any development or use of land issued by the city prior to the adoption of this Land Development Code) may be revoked by the city council, after notice and hearing, for violation of the terms and conditions upon which such permit or approval was issued or for violation of the requirements, conditions, and limitations of this Land Development Code (or prior regulations) applicable to the development or use for which such permit or approval was issued. This remedy is in addition to any other remedy or penalty provided in this Code. 
b.  The city manager may apply to the city council for revocation of any permit or approval described in this section upon first notifying the owner of the property for which such permit or approval was issued, and the permittee if different from the property owner, of the city manager's intention to seek such revocation. Such notice shall be given in the same manner in which notices of violation are given pursuant to the city's code enforcement procedures and shall be served at least 14 days prior to the city council meeting at which the application for revocation will be heard. If it is necessary to the public health, welfare, and safety that an application for revocation of any permit or approval be considered by the city council without 14 days' advance notice, the city council may waive the specific notice requirements provided for in this section upon finding that reasonable attempts, under the circumstances, have been made to notify the property owner, and the permittee if different. 
c.  After hearing all relevant evidence, testimony, and opinion concerning the requested revocation, the city council may render its decision immediately or may continue the hearing to allow the property owner or permittee to rectify any violation. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 3-90-2; Code 1994, § 86-210; Ord. No. 95-7594, § 9, 12-20-1995; Ord. No. 02-9778, § 1, 9-4-2002) 
Sec. 46-41. - Claims for vested rights. 
(a)  Public hearing process. An applicant claiming that certain property rights have been vested prior to the effective date of a city-initiated rezone ordinance adopted on or after August 1, 1998, or prior to the effective date of a Charter amendment adopted by referendum on February 1, 2000, and set forth in section 14.1 of the Charter, limiting building height in certain districts, or claiming that there is a basis upon which the city should be estopped from applying the new regulations to a property, will be provided a public hearing which will ensure adequate procedural due process including notice, public hearing, the right to present and rebut evidence, and a formal record. 
(b)  Application procedure and deadline. 
(1)  An application for determination of vested rights shall be submitted in the form established by the city manager. A completed application for determination of vested rights shall be filed, if at all, within the following time periods: 
a.  As to rezones, 6 months of the effective date of the regulation. 
b.  As to height limitations contained in section 14.1 of the Charter, 3 months of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(2)  Failure to file such application for a property within the applicable period shall forever waive and bar all claims for vested rights or equitable estoppel for such property, it being the express intent of the city that such development rights be amortized over the applicable period, plus, if applicable, the additional 1-year limitation period established in subsection (h) of this section. 
(3)  An application fee in an amount to be determined by the city council shall accompany and be part of the application. The application shall, at a minimum, include: 
a.  Name, address, and telephone number of the owner and authorized agent, if other than the owner; 
b.  Street address, legal description, and acreage of the property; and 
c.  All factual information reasonably available to or within the knowledge of the owner and applicant to address the criteria established in subsection (g) of this section. 
(c)  Determination of completed application. After receipt of an application for determination of vested rights, the city manager shall, within 21 calendar days of receipt, determine whether the application submitted is complete. If it is determined that the application is not complete, the city manager shall notify the applicant in writing of the deficiencies within 10 days thereafter. The application shall not be processed until all deficiencies have been remedied. The burden is upon the applicant to assure that a completed application is filed within the applicable time period set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  Review and recommendation by city manager. After receipt of a completed application for determination of vested rights, the city manager shall review and evaluate the application based on the criteria in subsection (g) of this section. Based on the review and evaluation, the city manager shall prepare a written recommendation to the city council that the application should be denied, granted or granted with conditions by the city council. Such recommendation shall include findings of fact for each of the criteria established in subsection (g) to the extent that information is presented or obtained or inclusion is feasible or applicable. 
(e)  Review and determination of vested rights determination by city council. Except as provided in subsection (l) of this section, upon receipt by the city council of the application for determination of vested rights and the written recommendation of the city manager, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the application. At the hearing, the city council shall take evidence and sworn testimony in regard to the criteria set forth in subsection (g) of this section. The parties before the city council shall include the city, through its applicable staff member, the owner, agent or applicant, and the public. Testimony shall be limited to the matters directly relating to the standards set forth in subsection (g) of this section. The city attorney may represent the city in the proceedings. The city attorney may also represent and advise the city council during the hearing; provided, however, the city attorney shall not act as counsel to the city staff and the city council at the same hearing. The owner of the property and its authorized agents may offer such evidence at the public hearing as is relevant to the proceedings and criteria. The order of presentation before the city council at the public hearing shall be as follows: 
(1)  Owner or applicant presentation, witnesses and evidence; 
(2)  The city's summary of the application, written recommendation, witnesses and other evidence; and 
(3)  Public witnesses and evidence. 
(f)  Issuance of vested rights determination by city council. After the completion of the public hearing under subsection (e) of this section, the city council shall consider the application for determination of vested rights, the recommendation of the city manager, and the evidence and testimony presented at the public hearing, based on the criteria set forth in subsection (g) of this section, and shall deny, grant, or grant with conditions the application for determination of vested rights for the property or properties at issue. The determination shall be in writing and shall include findings of fact for each of the applicable criteria established in subsection (g) of this section, conclusions of law for each of such criteria, and a determination denying, granting, or granting with conditions, in whole or in part, the vested rights. 
(g)  Criteria for vested rights. This section is intended to adhere to and apply existing state case law and statutory law as they relate to the doctrine of vested rights and equitable estoppel as applied to a local government exercising its authority and powers in city-initiated rezones or Charter-mandated height limitations. The criteria herein provided shall be considered in rendering a vested rights determination under this section. It is intended that each case be decided on a case-by-case factual analysis. An owner shall be entitled to a positive determination of vested rights only if such owner demonstrates by substantial competent evidence that all 3 of the following requirements of the 3-part test under Florida common law have been met: 
(1)  Upon some act or omission of the city; 
(2)  A property owner relying in good faith; 
(3)  Has made such a substantial change in position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the rights acquired. 
Existing state case law applicable to the case may be presented to and considered by city council. 
(h)  Limitation on determination of vested rights. A determination of vested rights which grants an application for determination of vested rights shall expire and be null and void: 
(1)  Unless construction on the subject property is commenced pursuant to a final development order, final subdivision plat, or final site development plan, within 1 year after the issuance of the determination of vested rights under this section; or 
(2)  Where substantial permanent buildings have been or are being constructed or installed pursuant to a valid, unexpired, final development order of the city, within 1 year after issuance of the determination of vested rights under this section. 
In either case, such development, whether pursuant to a final development order, final subdivision plat, or final site development plan, shall continue in good faith until project completion. Failure to obtain a building permit within 1 year after the issuance of the determination of vested rights under this section shall render said vested rights to expire and become null and void. The aforementioned 1-year time limitation on the determination of vested rights shall be stayed during any time periods within which commencement of construction is prohibited or deferred by the city solely as a result of lack of adequate public facilities to serve the property. 
(i)  Public notice. Due public notice for vested rights hearings held pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be given. For purposes of this section due public notice shall mean at least 15 days' notice of the time, place and subject of such hearing published 1 time in the section where legal notice of general ordinances is placed, in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. Notice of a vested rights public hearing held pursuant to this section shall be prominently posted on the property for which the vested rights determination is sought and shall be sent to property owners within 500 feet of the property lines of the subject property at least 15 days prior to the scheduled public hearing. Said notice shall briefly state the time and place of the hearing, the nature of the matter to be discussed and that written comments may be filed with the city manager. 
(j)  Public participation. Affected parties may submit written comments and pertinent factual information and data to the city manager. Said comments and pertinent factual information and data shall be reviewed by the city manager, and, when relevant, shall be submitted to the city council as an attachment to the city manager's recommendation to the city council. Such written comments and pertinent factual information and data shall be submitted to the city manager at least 4 weekdays prior to the hearing. 
(k)  Applicability. This section shall be applicable to any vested rights claim based on a city-initiated rezone ordinance adopted by the city council on or after August 1, 1998, or to any vested rights claim based on a Charter-mandated building height limitation adopted by referendum on February 1, 2000 (Charter section 14.1). 
(l)  Special master. Due to the highly technical and legal nature of some vested rights determinations, the city council may engage 1 or more special masters to conduct evidentiary hearings, make findings and submit recommendations to the council; and upon agreement of the parties, to mediate and make recommendations to council. 
(1)  Selection of special master. The city council will select and appoint the special master. The city council may invite proposals from qualified persons to act as a special master, may keep and select from a list of qualified applicants, may engage a retired judge, or may request the chief judge of the circuit court for the 20th Judicial Circuit to make the selection. 
(2)  Qualifications. The special master must be admitted to practice law in the state, and in good standing; must demonstrate substantial experience in Florida land use law, local government law and administrative hearing procedures; must not have a conflicting engagement and must be available for the conduct and completion of hearings and issuance of written recommendations as required below. 
(3)  Conduct of hearings. The special master is delegated the power and duty of conducting the hearings referred to in this section, taking testimony and other evidence and submitting a report with written recommendations to the city council. It is expected that the hearing process will begin within 30 days after engagement; and that the final report with recommendations will be submitted to the city council within 60 days thereafter. The hearings shall be conducted as quasi-judicial hearings. The report shall specifically contain a recommendation as to whether the applicant has established vested rights, or a basis for equitable estoppel concerning the proposed development. 
(4)  Final agency action. 
a.  Within 60 days after receipt of the special master's report, the city council will conduct a hearing on the vested rights or estoppel claim, and within 30 days thereafter, will take final agency action as provided below. 
b.  The action by the city council will be based upon the application, the staff recommendations, testimony and other evidence adduced at the special master hearing and the findings and recommendations contained in the special master's report. The city council reserves the right to receive additional testimony and evidence, but will do so only where necessary to ensure that due process is accorded. 
c.  After considering the matter, the city council will do 1 of the following concerning the recommendation of the special master, by appropriate legislation: 
1.  Accept the recommendation as submitted and adopt it. 
2.  Modify the recommendation as submitted and adopt it as modified. 
3.  Reject the recommendation as submitted and adopt its own determination. 
d.  If the city council does not take final action within the time limits set forth in subsection a above, unless time limits are waived, the matter will be scheduled for the next regular council meeting after expiration of the time. If, after that meeting, the city council has not taken action, the application shall be deemed to be rejected as of that meeting date and shall constitute final agency action. 
e.  All time deadlines may be waived by mutual consent of the applicant and the city.

ARTICLE V. - TRANSPORTATION PROPORTIONATE FAIR-SHARE 

Sec. 48-96. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-97. - Applicability. 
    The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in the City of Naples that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city concurrency management system, including transportation facilities maintained by FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of section 48-98. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in F.S. Ch. 163.3180, regarding exceptions and de minimis impacts. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-98. - General requirements. 
(a)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the City of Naples by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
(2)  The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the City of Naples CIE or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the City of Naples Transportation Concurrency Management System. The provisions of subsection (b) may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the local government CIE or an adopted long-term schedule of capital improvements. 
(b)  The City of Naples may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the City of Naples Transportation Concurrency Management System, but is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or a long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS, where the following apply: 
(1)  The City of Naples adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the capital improvements element or long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the City manager or designee, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)1., consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. Financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
(2)  If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the City of Naples Capital Improvements Element are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system, the City of Naples may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
    The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the comprehensive plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term concurrency management system at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(c)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the City of Naples for locally maintained roadways and those of Collier County for the county road system and the Florida Department of Transportation for the state highway system. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-99. - Intergovernmental coordination. 
    Pursuant to policies in the Intergovernmental Coordination Element of the City of Naples comprehensive plan and applicable policies in the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council Regional Plan, the City of Naples shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including Collier County and FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-100. - Application process. 
(a)  Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of section 48-98. 
(b)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system, then the Florida Department of Transportation and Collier County will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(c)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the City of Naples that includes any application fee as may be included in the city's schedule of fees and the following: 
(1)  Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
(2)  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
(3)  Legal description and survey of property; 
(4)  Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
(5)  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
(6)  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); and 
(7)  Copy of concurrency application. 
(d)  The city manager or designee shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in section 48-98, then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The Naples City Council may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(e)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the strategic intermodal system requires the concurrency of the Florida Department of Transportation. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the Florida Department of Transportation for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(f)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the City of Naples or the applicant with direction from the City of Naples and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the Florida Department of Transportation for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a strategic intermodal system facility, no later than 60 days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than 30 days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(g)  The City of Naples shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the Naples City Council. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-101. - Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(b)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(c)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
"The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS." 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = s [(Development Trips;sub \sub;) / (SV Increase;sub \sub;)] x Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the Concurrency Management System; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per section 48-98; 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(d)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the City of Naples shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the capital improvement element, the metropolitan planning organization/transportation improvement program or the Florida Department of Transportation Work Program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(1)  An analysis by the City of Naples of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city council. In order to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be adjusted by an inflation factor; or 
(2)  The most recent issue of FDOT transportation costs, as adjusted based upon the type of cross-section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT district. 
(e)  If the City of Naples has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(f)  If the City of Naples has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the Collier County Property Appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the City of Naples and at no expense to the City of Naples. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the City of Naples at no expense to the City of Naples. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the City of Naples estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact the FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-102. - Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by Collier County's Impact Fee Ordinance. 
(b)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due per the Collier County Impact Fee Ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the Collier County pursuant to the requirements of the Collier County Impact Fee Ordinance. 
(c)  Major projects not included within Collier County's Impact Fee Ordinance or created under section 48-98(b)(1) and (2) which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the Collier County's discretion for impact fee credits. 
(d)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within Collier County's Impact Fee Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-103. - Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(a)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) the applicant shall receive a city certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within 12 months or timeframe provided in the local CMS of the execution of the agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(b)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of execution of the Agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to section 48-101 and adjusted accordingly. 
(c)  All developer improvements authorized under this ordinance must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(d)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(e)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(f)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the City of Naples will be non refundable. 
(g)  The City of Naples may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-104. - Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the City of Naples Capital Improvement Element, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the local government, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the Florida Department of Transportation Transportation Regional Incentive Program. 
(b)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the capital improvement element, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 48-98(b)(2). 
    Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, and then the City of Naples may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program. Such coordination shall be ratified by the City of Naples through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(c)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under section 48-101, the City of Naples shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods: 
(1)  An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution, a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the City of Naples. 
(2)  An account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility. 
(3)  The City of Naples may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the City of Naples and the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-105. - Optional provisions. 
(a)  Cross jurisdictional impacts. 
(1)  In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the City of Naples may enter an agreement with Collier County or the Florida Department of Transportation to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this section to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. This article may be amended as necessary in the future to reflect any such agreements. 
(2)  A development application submitted to the City of Naples subject to a transportation concurrency determination meeting all of the following criteria shall be subject to this section: 
a.  All or part of the proposed development is located within one mile of the area which is under the jurisdiction, for transportation concurrency, of Collier County or the Florida Department of Transportation; and 
b.  Using its own concurrency analysis procedures, the City of Naples concludes that the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five percent or more of the adopted peak hour level of service maximum service volume of a regional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation ("impacted regional facility"); and 
c.  The impacted regional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard, adopted by Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation, when the traffic from the proposed development is included. 
(3)  Upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to subsection (2)a.-c., the City of Naples shall notify the applicant and Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
a.  Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation shall have up to 90 days in which to notify the City of Naples of a proposed specific proportionate fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of F.S. § 163.3180(16). Should Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this section, then the provisions of this section would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair share requirements of the City of Naples. 
b.  If the subject application is subsequently approved by the City of Naples, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation has been satisfied. The City of Naples may require Collier County or Florida Department of Transportation to declare, in a resolution, ordinance, or equivalent document, its intent for the use of the concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant. 
(4)  Proportionate share program for transportation concurrency exception areas, transportation concurrency management areas and multimodal transportation districts. Within any local transportation concurrency management areas, and/or multimodal transportation districts, and/or transportation concurrency exception areas, the City of Naples hereby establishes a proportionate fair-share assessment, based on the expected costs and transportation benefits of all the programmed improvements within that district, and based on the expected trip generation of the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 06-11421, § 1, 11-1-06) 
Sec. 48-106. - Method for cost escalation. 
    This section contains a method to estimate growth in costs, through the computation of a three-year average of the actual cost growth rates. This will provide a growth rate that should be smoothed to avoid overcompensating for major fluctuations in costs that have occurred due to short term material shortages. 
Cost n = Cost 0 x (1 + Cost___growth 3yr ) n 
Where: 
Cost n  = The cost of the improvements in year n; 
Cost 0  = The cost of the improvement in the current year; 
Cost___growth 3yr  = The growth rate of costs over the last three years; 
N = The number of years until the improvement is constructed. 
    The three-year growth rate is determined by the following formula: 
Cost___growth 3yr  = [Cost___growth -1 + Cost___growth -2 + Cost___growth -3 ]/3 
Where: 
Cost___growth 3yr  = The growth rate of costs over the last three years; 
Cost___growth -1  = The growth rate of costs in the previous year; 
Cost___growth -2  = The growth rate of costs two years prior; 
Cost___growth -3  = The growth rate of costs three years prior.

ARTICLE VI. - PUBLIC SCHOOLS FACILITIES CONCURRENCY 

Sec. 48-120. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to ensure that the level of service standard established for each school type is achieved and maintained, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.31777, 163.3180(13) and 1013.33. 
(Ord. No. 10-12649, § 2, 4-7-2010) 
Sec. 48-121. - Uniform school concurrency process. 
(a)  Purpose. The city and the school district shall ensure that the level of service standard established for each type of school is achieved and maintained. 
(1)  Applicability. No residential subdivision plat or residential site plan for new residential development may be approved by the city, unless the application is exempt from these requirements as provided for in this section, or until a school capacity availability determination letter has been issued by the school district to the city indicating that adequate school capacity exists within a concurrency service area for each type of school. 
The city may condition the approval of the application to ensure that necessary schools are in place in order to validate or render effective the approval. This shall not limit the authority of the city to deny a residential subdivision plat or residential site plan, pursuant to its home rule regulatory powers. 
(2)  Exemptions. The following development orders and development shall be exempt from the terms of this section: 
a.  Single-family and mobile home lots of record, existing as of the effective date of school concurrency (February 18, 2009) or new single-family lots of record created through the subdivision process which do not increase the residential density above that approved in the land development regulations or comprehensive plan. 
b.  Any new residential development that has a final subdivision plat or site plan approval of a site specific development order as of the effective date of school concurrency (February 18, 2009). 
c.  Any amendment to any previously approved residential development order that does not increase the number of dwelling units or change the dwelling unit type (e.g., single-family to multi-family). 
d.  Age-restricted communities with no permanent residents under the age of 18. Exemption of an age-restricted community will be subject to a restrictive covenant limiting the age of permanent residents to 18 years and older. 
e.  All new residential subdivision plats, site plans or amendments to previously approved residential development orders, which are calculated to generate less than one student. Such development shall be subject to payment of school impact fees. 
f.  Development that has been authorized as a development of regional impact pursuant to F.S. Ch. 380, as of July 1, 2005. 
(b)  School concurrency application review. Any applicant submitting an application for a residential subdivision plat or residential site plan that is not exempt under this section is subject to school concurrency and must prepare and submit a school impact analysis to the city for review by the school district. 
(1)  The school impact analysis must indicate the location of the development, number of dwelling units and unit types (single-family, multi-family, etc.), a phasing schedule (if applicable), and age-restrictions for occupancy (if any). The city shall initiate the review by determining that the application is sufficient for processing. Once deemed sufficient, the city shall transmit the school impact analysis to the school district representative for review. The process is as follows: 
a.  An application for residential development is submitted to the city for a sufficiency review. Once deemed sufficient, the city transmits the school impact analysis to the school district for review. The school district may charge the applicant a non-refundable application fee payable to the school district to meet the cost of review. 
b.  Within 20 working days of receipt of a sufficient school impact analysis application, the school district representative shall review the application and provide written comments to the city. Each school impact analysis shall be reviewed in the order in which it is received. 
c.  In the event that there is not adequate capacity available within the adopted level of service standard in the concurrency service area in which the proposed development is located or in an adjacent concurrency service area to support the development impacts, the school district representative will issue a school capacity availability determination letter within 20 working days of receipt of the school impact analysis as provided in Subsection (b)(1)b above, detailing how the development is inconsistent with the adopted level of service standard, and offer the applicant the opportunity to enter into a negotiation period to allow time for the mitigation process. If the proposed mitigation is accepted by the school district, the city and the applicant, then those parties shall enter into an enforceable and binding agreement with the city and the applicant. 
d.  When capacity has been determined to be available, the school district representative shall issue a school capacity availability determination letter verifying available capacity to the applicant and the city within 20 working days of receipt of the school impact analysis application as provided in subsection (b)(1)b. 
e.  The city shall be responsible for notifying the school district representative when a residential development has received a certificate of public facility adequacy, when the development order for the residential development expires or is revoked, and when its school impact fees have been paid. 
(c)  School concurrency approval. Issuance of a school capacity availability determination letter by the school district identifying that capacity exists within the adopted level of service standard indicates only that school facilities are currently available, and capacity will not be reserved for the applicant's proposed residential development until the city issues a certificate of public facility adequacy. 
(1)  The city shall not issue a certificate of public facility adequacy for a residential development until receiving confirmation of available school capacity within the adopted level of service standard for each type of school, in the form of a school capacity availability determination letter from the school district. Once the city has issued a certificate of public facility adequacy, school concurrency for the residential development shall be valid for the life of the certificate of public facility adequacy. Expiration, extension or modification of a certificate of public facility adequacy for a residential development shall require a new review for adequate school capacity to be performed by the school district. 
(2)  The city shall notify the school district within ten working days of any official change in the status of a certificate of public facility adequacy for a residential development. 
(3)  The city shall not issue a building permit for a non-exempt residential development without confirming that the development received a certificate of public facility adequacy at subdivision plat approval or site plan approval, and the certificate of public facility adequacy is still valid. Once the city has issued a certificate of public facility adequacy, school concurrency for the residential development shall be valid for the life of the certificate of public facility adequacy. 
(d)  Proportionate share mitigation. In the event there is not sufficient school capacity available within the adopted level of service standard to support an applicant's development, the school district in coordination with the city may consider proportionate share mitigation options and, if accepted, shall enter into an enforceable and binding agreement with the applicant and the city to mitigate the impact from the development through the creation of additional school capacity. 
(e)  Mitigation. If mitigation is agreed to, the school district shall issue a new school capacity availability determination letter approving the applicant's development subject to those mitigation measures agreed to by the city, applicant and the school district. Prior to residential subdivision plat or residential site plan approval, the mitigation measures shall be memorialized in an enforceable and binding agreement with the city, school district and the applicant that specifically details mitigation provisions to be paid for by the applicant and the relevant terms and conditions. If mitigation is not agreed to, the school capacity availability determination letter shall detail why any mitigation proposals were rejected and why the development is not in compliance with school concurrency requirements. A school capacity availability determination letter indicating either that adequate capacity is available or that there is no available capacity following a 90-day negotiation period constitutes final agency action by the school district.

Sec. 50-107. - Parking needs analysis. 
(a)  Definition. A parking needs analysis is a statement by a property or business owner which indicates that the requirements of section 50-104 regarding the number of parking spaces required are not applicable to such person's particular situation because the use is unique, the operational method is atypical, or the particular use is not listed within the section. 
(b)  Submittal requirements. 
(1)  Preapplication conference. A property or business owner who wishes to have a parking needs analysis approved must schedule a preapplication conference with a member of the city staff as designated by the city manager, to determine specific application requirements and acceptable methodology.

a.  Estimates of parking requirements based on recommendations in studies such as those from the Urban Land Institute (ULI), the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or the Traffic Institute, or industry standards based on data collected from geographic areas and uses or combinations of uses which are the same or comparable to the proposed area and use. Comparability and applicability of data shall be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. The study shall document the source of data used to develop recommendations. 
b.  An analysis of the extent to which other options exist for parking which would lessen the on-site parking requirement. 
c.  An operational procedure which indicates that the full parking requirement is not needed, and a guarantee of continuity of such procedure. 
d.  Actual parking counts for the building or site which indicate that the full number of parking spaces are not required. Such counts must be taken during the peak hours of the peak season. 
(3)  Statement of remedies. Any parking needs analysis shall include a statement of the remedies which will be available if it is determined that the full number of parking spaces as required by this land development code is needed. 
(4)  Preparation. If for any reason a traffic impact statement is required, the parking needs analysis shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the traffic impact statement. If a traffic impact statement is not required, the parking needs analysis may be prepared by the owner or petitioner. The parking needs analysis shall be conducted according to the methodology agreed upon at the preapplication conference and shall include all documentation agreed upon at the preapplication conference. 
(c)  Method of approval. 
(1)  Change of use. The city manager shall review the parking needs analysis for a change or expansion of use within an existing building. Upon a finding by the city manager that the analysis uses the methodology determined to be appropriate at the preapplication meeting, and that the analysis includes an acceptable and reasonable remedy which can be implemented within a 60-day period, the analysis shall be approved. 
(2)  Increase in building size. If the parking needs analysis is presented for an increase in building size, it shall be reviewed through and meet the criteria of the conditional use process as listed in section 46-34. Any such approval must be recorded in the public records of the county at the expense of the owner or applicant. 
(d)  Notification of insufficient parking. If a parking needs analysis was approved according to subsection (c)(1) of this section and the number of spaces is insufficient, the city manager shall notify the property owner by certified mail that the remedies must be implemented within 60 days. The city manager shall make a determination of insufficient parking by one of the following methods: 
(1)  Monitoring of the parking; 
(2)  Increased parking in the right-of-way caused by insufficient parking on site for that property; or 
(3)  Verified complaints of parking on neighboring properties.

ARTICLE VI. - RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION AND STANDARDS 

Sec. 50-151. - Findings. 
    The existing circulation system in the city has certain deficiencies and inadequacies, including incomplete street systems, narrow rights-of-way, substandard corner radii, lack of sidewalks and bikepaths and the like, and present and projected revenue sources of the city are inadequate to correct such deficiencies and inadequacies. Continuing new multifamily residential, commercial and industrial development will add substantially to the traffic burden of the city and thus compel the continued improvement of the city's circulation system. Such development will benefit the city and subject properties will increase in value as a result of improved accessibility and the provision of a safe and well-integrated circulation system. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 8-6-1; Code 1994, § 106-151) 
Sec. 50-152. - Purpose of article. 
    It is the intent and purpose of this article to enable the city to require a property owner or developer to provide for the dedication and improvement of property for circulation purposes to ensure that the city is served by streets of adequate width and alignment, that all of the necessary improvements are provided, and that the circulation system is safe and continuous to ensure the public safety, decrease traffic congestion and provide for an adequate circulation system. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 8-6-2; Code 1994, § 106-152) 
Sec. 50-153. - Dedication and improvement required. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this article, no building or structure shall be constructed, erected, relocated, enlarged, remodeled or otherwise altered, and no building permit shall be issued for such work, on any lot or parcel for which it has been determined that certain right-of-way dedications for circulation purposes are required, until such required dedications are made to the city. No final occupancy approval shall be granted unless and until all required circulation improvements are provided. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 8-6-3; Code 1994, § 106-153) 
Sec. 50-154. - Determination of required dedications and improvements. 
    The city council, upon the recommendation of the staff and planning advisory board, shall determine when and to what extent circulation-related right-of-way dedications and improvements shall be required, based upon generally accepted minimum safety standards and criteria, other standards, alignments and the like as may be adopted as a part of the city's comprehensive plan and other city or county ordinances, or other normally accepted standards as may be applicable. The city manager may require a property owner or developer to provide the city with a traffic impact study to assist the city in determining dedication and improvement requirements. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 8-6-4; Code 1994, § 106-154) 
Sec. 50-155. - Exemptions. 
    Exemptions to the dedication and improvement requirements of this article are as follows: 
(1)  Dedication of right-of-way and circulation-related improvements are not required when the enlargement of any building or structure or the erection of an accessory structure involves an aggregate amount of work performed within any 12-month period of less than 200 square feet of floor area. 
(2)  Dedication of right-of-way and circulation-related improvements are not required where the nonstructural alteration, repair or remodeling of any building or structure involves an aggregate amount of work performed within any 12-month period of less than $7,000.00 in construction evaluation as determined by the city manager. 
(3)  Dedication of right-of-way and circulation-related improvements are not required for additions, nonstructural alterations or accessory buildings incidental to a single-family residential building legally existing on a lot having single-family residential zoning, provided that no additional dwelling units are established.

Sec. 52-31. - Purpose of article. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures to reduce the potential harmful effects of natural phenomena occurring along the coastal areas of the city. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 10-3; Code 1994, § 114-31) 
Sec. 52-32. - Coastal construction code. 
(a)  Title. The provisions contained in this section shall constitute the coastal construction code for construction within the coastal building zone and coastal barrier islands in the city, and shall be referred to as the coastal code. 
(b)  Findings. 
(1)  Coastal areas play an important role in protecting the ecology and the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(2)  Coastal areas form the first line of defense for the mainland against both winter storms and hurricanes in that the sand dunes of coastal areas perform protective functions for public and private property, but placement of permanent structures in these protective areas may lead to increased risks to life and property and increased costs to the public. Coastal areas often protect lagoons, salt marshes, estuaries, bays, marine habitats and the mainland from the direct action of ocean waves and storm surges; absorb the forces of oceanic activity; protect calmer waters and stable shores; and are dynamic geologic systems with topography that is subject to alteration by waves, storm surges, flooding or littoral currents. 
(3)  Coastal areas are one of the city's most valuable resources and have extremely high recreational and aesthetic value which should be preserved and enhanced. Coastal areas provide a unique habitat for birds, wildlife, marine life, and plant life and protect waters that are vital to this ecosystem. 
(4)  It is anticipated that there will be a tremendous cost to the city and state for post-disaster redevelopment in the coastal areas, but the costs can be reduced by preventive measures which should be taken on a continuing basis in order to reduce the harmful and costly consequences of natural and manmade disasters or emergencies. 
(c)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters occurring along the coastal areas of the city, which fronts on the Gulf of Mexico. These standards are intended to specifically address design features which affect the structural stability of the beaches, dunes and topography of adjacent properties. This section is site-specific to the coastal building zone and coastal barrier islands as defined in this section and is not applicable to other locations. In the event of a conflict between this section and other chapters of this Code, the requirements resulting in more restrictive design shall apply. No provision in this section shall be construed to permit any construction in any area where prohibited by local, city, county or state regulation. 
(d)  Scope. 
(1)  Applicability generally. The requirements of this section shall apply to the following types of construction in the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands in the city: 
a.  The new construction of or substantial improvement to major structures, non-habitable major structures and minor structures as defined in this section. 
b.  Construction which would change or alter the character of the shoreline, e.g., excavation, grading or paving. This section does not apply to minor work in the nature of normal beach cleaning or debris removal. 
(2)  Existing structures. The requirements of this section shall not apply to existing structures, structures under construction, or structures for which a valid and unexpired municipal or county building permit was issued prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(3)  Multizone structures. For structures located partially in the coastal building zone, the requirements of this section shall apply to the entire structure. 
(4)  Construction seaward of mean high water. Structures or construction extending seaward of the mean high-water line which are regulated by F.S. § 161.041, e.g., groins, jetties, moles, breakwaters, seawalls, revetments, beach nourishment, inlet dredging, etc., are specifically exempt from the provisions of this section. In addition, this section does not apply to piers, pipelines or outfalls which are regulated pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 161.053. 
(e)  Coastal construction requirements. 
(1)  Certification of application for building permit. Applications for building permits for all construction in the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands shall be certified by an architect or professional engineer registered in the state. Such certification shall state that the design plans and specifications for the construction are in compliance with the criteria established by this section. 
(2)  Structural requirements for major structures. All major structures shall be designed, constructed and located in compliance with the National Flood Insurance Regulations as found in 44 CFR parts 59 and 60 or chapter 16, article IV of this code, whichever is more restrictive. 
(3)  Structural requirements for non-habitable major structures. Non-habitable major structures must meet the specific requirements of subsection (2) of this section, and shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach, vegetation and sand dune system and shall comply with applicable standards of construction found in chapter 16, article IV of this code. All sewage treatment and public water supply systems shall be floodproofed to prevent infiltration of surface water anticipated under design storm conditions. Underground utilities, excluding pad transformers and vaults, shall be floodproofed to prevent infiltration of surface water expected under design storm conditions or shall otherwise be designed to function when submerged under such storm conditions. 
(4)  Structural requirements for minor structures. Minor structures shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach, vegetation and sand dune system and shall comply with the applicable standards of construction found in chapter 16, article IV of this code. 
(5)  Special considerations. Man-made alterations of any sand dunes or mangroves which would increase potential flood damage are prohibited. Primary frontal dunes shall not be altered unless a qualified engineer demonstrates and certifies that flood risk will not be increased to the subject property, or other, surrounding properties. Activities which reduce the volume of sand on the dunes or beach will be presumed to increase flood risk to landward locations. 
(6)  Location of construction. Construction, except for elevated walkways, lifeguard support stands, piers, beach access ramps, gazebos, and coastal or shore protection structures, shall be located a sufficient distance landward of the beach to permit natural shoreline fluctuations and to preserve sand dune stability. 
(f)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Breakaway wall and frangible wall mean a partition independent of supporting structural members that will withstand design wind forces, but will fail under hydrostatic, wave and run-up forces associated with the design storm surge. Under such conditions, the wall will fail in a manner such that it dissolves or breaks up into components that will not act as potentially damaging missiles. 
    Building support structure means any structure which supports floor, wall or column loads, and transmits them to the foundation. The term shall include beams, grade beams or joists, and includes the lowest horizontal structural member exclusive of piles, columns or footings. 
    Coastal building zone (CBZ) means the land area from the seasonal high-water line to a line 1,500 feet landward from the coastal construction control line as established pursuant to F.S. § 161.053. On coastal barrier islands, the coastal building zone is defined as the area 5,000 feet landward from the coastal construction control line, or the entire island, whichever is less. On barrier islands for which no coastal construction control line has been established, the coastal building zone is the area 5,000 feet landward from the mean high-water line, or the entire island, whichever is less. 
    Coastal Construction Control Line (CCCL) means the landward extent of that portion of the beach-dune system which is subject to severe fluctuations based upon a 100-year storm surge, storm waves, or other predictable weather conditions as established by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection on June 28, 1989, in accordance with F.S. § 161.053, as amended. 
    Coastal or shore protection structure means shore-hardening structures, such as seawalls, bulkheads, revetments, rubble mound structures, groins, breakwaters, and aggregates of materials other than beach sand used for shore protection; beach and sand dune restoration; and other structures which are intended to prevent erosion or protect other structures from wave and hydrodynamic forces. 
    Construction means the carrying out of any building, clearing, filling, excavation or substantial improvement in the size or use of any structure or the appearance of any land. When appropriate to the context, the term "construction" refers to the act of construction or the result of construction. 
    Major structure includes but is not limited to residential buildings, including mobile homes, commercial, institutional, industrial and other construction having the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones. 
    Mangrove vegetation or stand means an assemblage of mangrove trees which are mostly low trees noted for a copious development of interlacing adventitious roots above ground and which contain one or more of the following species: Black mangrove (Avicennia Nitida); red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle); white mangrove (Languncularia Racemosa); and buttonwood (Conocarpus Erecta). 
    Minor structure includes but is not limited to pile-supported elevated dune and beach walkover structures, beach access ramps and walkways; stairways; pile-supported elevated viewing platforms, gazebos and boardwalks; lifeguard support stands; public and private bathhouses; sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, handball courts, racquetball courts and other uncovered paved areas; retaining walls; and sand fences, privacy fences, ornamental walls, ornamental garden structures, aviaries and other ornamental construction. It shall be a characteristic of minor structures that they are considered to be expendable under design wind, wave and storm forces. 
    Nonhabitable major structure includes but is not limited to swimming pools; parking garages; pipelines; piers; canals, lakes, ditches, drainage structures and other water-retention structures; water and sewage treatment plants; electrical power plants, transmission and distribution lines, transformer pads, vaults and substations; roads, bridges, streets and highways; and underground storage tanks. 
    Sand dunes means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach. "Sand dunes" is alternatively termed "dune or dunes" 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds, over a 5-year period, a cumulative total of 50 percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
    For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 10-3-1; Code 1994, § 114-32; Ord. No. 12-13113, § 1, 4-18-2012 ) 
Sec. 52-33. - Coastal construction setback line. 
(a)  Establishment. There is hereby established for the city a coastal construction setback line (CCSL) for construction of single-family, multifamily and commercial structures, as established and approved on June 27, 1989, by the governor and cabinet of the state, such line lying within the boundaries and limits of the city and to be recorded in the coastal setback line book of the public records of the county, and set forth in the F.A.C. 62B-26.022, titled "Description of the Collier County Coastal Construction Control Line."

Where such action is necessary in the performance of the city manager's duties under this section, the city manager shall have authority to remove any boat, and shall move or cause the boat to be removed to a boatyard or to a public dock. 
(c)  Construction of lakes, canals and streams. A permit must be obtained before beginning construction of any lake, stream, canal or other excavation. Before any permit may be issued, the plan thereof must be presented to the city council with the approval of the city manager, and after such approval the city council in its discretion may then allow a permit to be issued. It shall be unlawful for any person to undertake the construction of any project as set out in this subsection without first obtaining a permit as set forth in this subsection. 
(d)  Construction of seawalls, groins and other beach erosion control structures. 
(1)  All applications for permits to construct groins or other beach erosion control structures along the Gulf of Mexico shall, be presented to the city manager for a recommendation. After the recommendation is made, the application for the permit to construct groins or other beach erosion control structures, accompanied by a certified survey showing the location of the groin or other beach erosion control structure and adjoining groins or other beach erosion control structures, shall be presented to the city council for final approval. Where steps are necessary to provide access along the beach to the public, then such steps shall be shown as part of the plan for groin construction prior to issuance of the permit, and such steps shall be constructed and maintained in a safe condition at all times. 
(2)  It is hereby declared unlawful and a public nuisance for any property owner in the city to permit a seawall or revetment to fail or to fall into disrepair; or to fail to repair or reconstruct any failed seawall or revetment or any seawall or revetment in disrepair, upon such person's property or adjacent to and protecting such person's property. It is further declared unlawful and a public nuisance for any property owner to fail to remove from such person's property or an adjacent body of water the debris and rubble of any failed seawall or revetment, or seawall or revetment in disrepair, belonging to such person. 
(3)  Existing seawalls and revetments on natural waterbodies may be replaced with a revetment or with a vertical seawall with the provision of rip rap placed at the base of the wall up to the mean high water line for the entire length of the seawall. Revetments and seawalls may be replaced with a vertical seawall in manmade waterbodies, provided that the seawall is within the property line and maintains the established shoreline. Revetments being more environmentally sound and desirable than vertical seawalls in natural waterbodies, the city encourages property owners to replace failed seawalls with revetments, if such a replacement can be effected without disturbing the structural integrity of neighboring or adjacent shorelines. 
(4)  The top of cap elevation for all replacement and new seawalls and seawall caps shall not exceed 4.8 feet N.A.V.D. If the top of a seawall cap is constructed at an elevation differing from the adjacent property owner top of cap elevation by greater than one foot, then a return wall is required to sufficiently provide for the break in grade at the property line. Seawalls exceeding 4.8 feet N.A.V.D. in height prior to the effective date of this article may be maintained, repaired and replaced to their current height. 
(5)  Seawalls and revetments located seaward of the coastal construction setback line or the city's most restrictive setback line, as defined in the land development code, are controlled by section 52-33 of this code and by regulations of the Division of Beaches and Shores of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Replacement of a seawall or revetment that is located seaward of the coastal construction setback line necessitates submission of a permit application to the state department of environmental protection and a variance petition to the city. 
(6)  The placement of a new seawall waterward of an existing seawall is permitted, subject to the following conditions: 
a.  A Florida registered professional engineer must certify the new seawall design. 
b.  The new seawall shall not extend more than 18 inches from the waterward face of the original alignment of the existing vertical seawall location. 
c.  The new seawall shall be placed vertically plumb. 
d.  Placing a seawall in front of an existing seawall shall only be permitted once unless the seawall behind the new seawall is removed. 
e.  Existing seawall sections that interfere with new seawall location shall be removed. 
f.  The new seawall shall include an adequate closure of gaps at each property line. 
g.  For zoning purposes, the setbacks for the property will be measured from either the property line or the waterside of the original seawall slab, whichever is more restrictive, and will not be adjusted to accommodate the new seawall addition. For purposes of pier construction, the shore normal dimensions will be measured from the waterside of the original seawall slab. 
(7)  Prior to final inspection and approval of a new or replacement seawall or seawall cap, a post-construction survey shall be required. Repairs of existing seawalls and seawall caps which do not alter the height or location shall not be subject to this requirement unless determined to be necessary by the city manager to ensure compliance with applicable codes and regulations. 
(8)  On all natural waterways, an apron of rip-rap shall be placed at the base of all new and repaired seawalls up to the mean high water line for the entire length of the seawall to absorb the wave energy and protect the underlying soft earth or sand from being carried away, as well as to provide habitat for desirable marine species. This rip-rap shall be required at the base of all new seawalls and at the time that an existing seawall is repaired where the replacement constitutes greater than 50 percent of the entire length of the seawall or includes the replacement of a panel. 
(9)  A retaining wall may be built as an alternative to a vertical seawall, provided that all activities, including dredging, filling, slope grading, or equipment access and similar activities and all portions of the wall are located landward of the mean high water line. 
Cross-section of retaining wall

(10)  Application requirements. 
a.  All plans and specifications for seawalls and revetments shall be prepared by a licensed or registered professional engineer registered in the State of Florida. 
b.  The design of the structures shall adequately address all soil; and all live, dead and hydrostatic loadings expected to exist during the life of the structure. 
c.  All applications for permits to construct or replace seawalls along any property within the city that fronts upon a natural waterbody shall be presented to the city manager for a recommendation. After a recommendation is made, the application for the permit to construct the seawall, accompanied by a certified survey showing the location of the seawall and adjoining seawalls therein, shall be presented to the city council for final approval. 
d.  Applications for permits to construct or replace seawalls fronting on a manmade waterbody shall be reviewed by the city manager for approval. The city manager shall review the plans and specifications to determine if all appropriate engineering certifications are provided. Upon determination that all certifications are provided, the city manager shall issue a permit to perform such work. 
(11)  There are existing seawalls and related structures such as docks and boat lifts that have been constructed waterward of platted lots or unplatted parcels. There are also vacant lots or parcels located adjacent to lots or parcels where the structures have been constructed waterward of the platted lot or unplatted parcel line. In the first situation, existing encroachments are causing defects in title and potential for refusal by lenders to lend. In the second situation, constructing the structure within the property line will create a recessed seawall or a notched appearance. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this code, the following shall apply: 
a.  Upon application and payment of the established fee by the upland owner, the city manager may issue a certificate of no objection to allow existing seawalls and related structures that are located waterward of a platted lot or unplatted parcel line, to remain in place as long as the seawall is properly maintained. The city manager may also issue a permit to allow a seawall or related structure to be constructed waterward of a platted lot or unplatted parcel boundary, in order to maintain an even seawall line along the waterway. Where a new seawall requires council approval regardless of location within or outside of the property boundary, the council may approve a seawall permit petition. 
b.  The application must be accompanied by the information required in (10)(c) or (d) above depending upon whether it is an existing seawall or related structure, or a new seawall. 
c.  The permit shall be conditioned upon delivery by the property owner to the city, a recordable instrument executed by the property owner agreeing and acknowledging that: 
1.  The structure does not become the city's structure by virtue of granting the certificate of no objection or the permit; 
2.  The owner assumes responsibility for maintenance, repair and replacement of the structure; 
3.  The owner assumes responsibility for any claims that may be made by the owner of the property upon which a structure may encroach, including without limitation, the State of Florida; and 
4.  The city does not warrant ownership or title. 
(e)  Filling lakes; erecting buildings over lake. 
(1)  Purpose; permit required. It is hereby declared that the purpose of this subsection is to protect the littoral zones of the lakes within the city. Whether decorative or part of a private or public stormwater management system, the lakes provide a habitat for a variety of fishes, birds and other valuable organisms. Because a natural shoreline is an integral part of a functioning, balanced lake, alterations to the shoreline may be harmful to the ecology of the lake. With this understanding, the following provision is adopted: It shall be unlawful for any person to fill any portion of an existing lake or erect any building structure over an existing lake without first obtaining a permit from the city council, unless the lake is already permitted by the South Florida Water Management District and is thereby subject to the rules and regulations adopted by that agency, including those that address lake filling and building structures. 
(2)  Definition. For the purpose of this subsection, the term "filling" means placement of soil, sand, rock or other solid material into the water, or construction of shore stabilizing or protection structures such as riprap or block revetments or concrete, metal or wood bulkheads. 
(3)  Application for permit; approval. A permit application shall be submitted to the city manager, who will evaluate the application and present it, along with a staff recommendation, to the city council for its consideration. The application must include a survey of the present shoreline and drawings illustrating plan and cross sectional views of the proposed filling activity. The application must include a detailed justification for the need for the filling activity and an evaluation of alternative methods of shoreline protection, such as the use of native wetland vegetation to prevent erosion, provide habitat, and improve water quality. While riprap may be appropriate in some locations for erosion control of steep banks, the use of riprap is discouraged as it hardens shorelines and reduces habitat value. 
a.  The city manager will notify owners, as they appear on the tax collector's rolls, of property with frontage on the same lake as the property described in the petition. The notice shall be distributed by regular mail at least 14 days prior to the meeting of the city council at which the petition is to be considered. However, failure to notify all owners of property with frontage on the same lake by mail through inadvertence will not render the hearing void. 
b.  If the city council shall find that the proposed activities or project will not violate any statute, zoning law, ordinance or other restrictions which may be applicable thereto; that no harmful obstruction to the stormwater management system within such area will arise from the proposed construction; that no significant biological or ecological adverse impact will result therefrom; that no harmful or increased erosion, shoaling or stagnant areas of water will be created thereby; and that no material injury or monetary damage to adjoining land will accrue therefrom, the application may be approved, or approved with conditions. 
c.  Where an application is approved, the city council may require, as a condition of the permit, that protective measures, including but not limited to turbidity screens, be employed to prevent harmful biological, ecological or hydrological impacts from occurring to the surrounding waters. 
(4)  Construction. Construction and maintenance or repair of shore stabilizing or protection structures must be performed by licensed contractors as defined in section 10-231. 
(5)  Exemptions. Maintenance or repair of existing shore protection structures shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection, but shall require issuance of a permit from the building official. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 10-6-1; Code 1994, § 114-132; Ord. No. 95-7448, § 1, 6-7-1995; Ord. No. 13-13302, § 2, 6-12-2013 ; Ord. No. 14-13415, § 2, 2-19-2014 ; Ord. No. 14-13440, § 1, 4-2-2014 ; Ord. No. 15-13681, § 1, 9-2-2015 ) 
Sec. 52-93. - Dredging, filling and other marine construction in inland waters. 
(a)  Permit and approval procedures; exemptions from permit. 
(1)  Purpose; general policy. It is hereby declared that the purpose of this section is to protect the littoral zone in the inland waters of the city. This fragile zone is essential to the abundance and variety of marine life in the inland waters of the city and impacts ultimately on the cleanliness, productivity and usefulness of the city's bays, streams, canals and rivers. Because of past marine construction activities and dredging and filling projects already undertaken in the bay, the littoral zone has already been stressed beyond a desirable degree. In general, therefore, dredging and filling in this littoral zone area is declared to be harmful and may well cause irreparable damage, thereby diminishing forever the quality of life for the citizens of the city. With this understanding, the following provision is adopted: No dredging or filling shall be performed in, upon or contiguous to any inland water area of the city, including but not limited to construction under section 52-92(c) through (e), until approval of such work has been obtained in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in this section. 
(2)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following words and terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows: 
Failed seawall or revetment means a seawall or revetment that has failed structurally or that does not serve to stabilize the position of the shoreline. 
Littoral zone means the shallow bottom land fringing the shoreline and islands within the inland waters of the city, from the surface down to a depth of approximately six feet at mean low water. 
Maintenance dredging means the dredging of an existing manmade canal or channel, where the spoil material is to be removed and deposited on a self-contained upland spoil site which will prevent the escape of the spoil material into the waters of the state, provided that no more dredging is to be performed than is necessary to restore the canal or channel to original design specifications, and provided that control devices are utilized to prevent turbidity and toxic or deleterious substances from discharging into adjacent waters during maintenance dredging 
Manmade waterbody means an artificially created body of water that has been totally or substantially dredged or excavated and which does not overlap natural wetlands or other surface waters. 
Mooring piles includes dolphins or other pilings which are placed to provide anchorage, mooring or space for a ship or boat. 
Natural waterbody means a waterbody that is not manmade, including without limitation, Naples Bay, Dollar Bay, Haldeman Creek, Rock Creek, the Gordon River and the Gulf of Mexico. 
Required side yard setback means those lines defined in the zoning ordinance, beyond which the property owner may not build. 
Retaining wall means a stabilization structure that is substantially or functionally identical to a seawall, except all portions of the wall are in the uplands, landward of the mean high water line and all activities, such as dredging, filling, slope grading, or equipment access, are confined to uplands. 
Revetment means a sloping rip rap structure which serves to separate real property or any improvements thereon from any natural or manmade body of water. 
Seawall means any solid upright structure which serves to separate real property or any improvements thereon from any natural or manmade body of water. 
(3)  Application for approval. All applications for approval of construction under this section shall be submitted to the city manager. Each application shall contain the following information: 
a.  The application shall include an affidavit of ownership of the upland property abutting the proposed construction activities. 
b.  The application shall include a written statement describing the proposed construction activities or project. 
c.  The application shall include a plan or sketch of the proposed construction activities or structure sufficient in detail to show the mean high-water line, the mean low-water line, the official bulkhead line, designation of soundings and elevations in the area of the construction, a simple description of shoreline vegetation and the location and approximate relation of the construction to adjacent properties and existing coastal construction in the area. All applications and plans shall be prepared by a registered state engineer to meet the requirements of this land development code and shall bear the name, address and official seal of the engineer. 
d.  If the proposed activity is within a natural water body, the application must include a copy of a state department of environmental protection authorization to proceed under a noticed general permit or a letter from the department of environmental protection indicating that the proposed activity is exempt from the need for a dredge and fill permit; or indicate whether the state authorization has been applied for. Any city permit issued under this provision is subject to any state or federal permit or exemption. 
e.  Biological, hydrographic or ecological surveys shall be included with the application. 
(4)  Approval procedure. Upon receipt of an application, the city manager shall make a determination as to whether the proposed activities occur in the manmade canal or natural water body and inform the applicant of such decision. 
a.  Approval by city council. Approval of the city council must be obtained for all dredge and fill activities, except as provided in subsection (a)(4)b. of this section, in accordance with the following procedure: 
1.  The application shall be submitted to the city manager in compliance with subsection (a)(3) of this section. The city manager will investigate and review the proposed plan and give notice of a public hearing to consider the application in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least ten days prior to the public hearing. Such publication shall include a brief description of the proposed work and the location thereof. Copies of such notice shall be mailed to the property owners described in the application. 
2.  If the city council shall find that the proposed activities or project will not violate any statute, zoning law, ordinance or other restrictions which may be applicable thereto; that no harmful obstruction to or harmful alteration of the natural flow of the navigable water within such area will arise from the proposed construction; that no significant biological or ecological adverse impact will result therefrom; that no harmful or increased erosion, shoaling or channels or stagnant areas of water will be created thereby; and that no material injury or monetary damage to adjoining land will accrue therefrom, the application may be approved, or approved with conditions, subject to approval of the appropriate departments of the state and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
3.  When an application is approved, the city council may require, as a condition of the permit, that protective measures, including but not limited to turbidity screens, be employed to prevent harmful biological, ecological or hydrological impacts from occurring to the surrounding waters. 
b.  Issuance of permit by city manager. 
1.  The following dredge and fill activities shall be permitted by the city manager: 
i.  Maintenance dredging of boat slips. 
ii.  Filling of boat slips, providing the activity is carried out in a manner that does not cause increased turbidity in the adjacent waterway. Such precautionary measures include the use of full water-column turbidity screens or constructing a new bulkhead or seawall section across the mouth of the boat slip prior to beginning the fill operation. 
iii.  Maintenance dredging providing the dredging is confined to the area adjacent to an existing dock that would be occupied by a vessel approaching, departing or moored to the dock. The dimensions of the area to be dredged will be finalized after a site visit by the city manager. Disturbance of productive substrates, such as oyster bars, may require mitigation. If so, a mitigation plan will be arranged with the city manager. The maximum depth of maintenance dredging shall not exceed below five feet mean low water. Removal of intertidal or subtidal sediment, organisms or vegetation from the littoral zone immediately adjacent to a seawall or beneath a dock will not be permitted. The width of this zone will be determined after a site visit by the city manager. Dredging will not be permitted adjacent to a proposed or newly constructed dock, if the dock could have been designed to avoid the need for dredging. Such design measures include positioning the dock appropriately along the shoreline, as well as bridging near shore shoal areas. 
iv.  Recapturing of existing submerged land up to and no further than the platted property line in manmade waterbodies, including only that backfilling necessary to level the land. This allowance does not apply to the R1-15A district, which is exempt from this subsection. 
2.  The application for approval of dredge and fill activities under subsection (a)(4)b.1. of this section shall contain the following information: 
i.  Affidavit of ownership of the upland property abutting the proposed construction activities. 
ii.  A written statement describing the proposed construction activities or project. 
iii.  A survey of the property depicting the property line, the existing mean high water line, mean low water line and the official bulkhead line. 
iv.  A plan or sketch of the proposed construction activities or structure sufficient in detail and quality to show the location and approximate relation of the construction to the mean high-water line, the mean low-water line, the official bulkhead line, the adjacent properties and existing coastal construction in the area, as well as a designation of soundings and elevations in the area of the construction and a simple description of shoreline vegetation and intertidal habitat. 
v.  An applicant denied a permit under this subsection can apply for a permit under subsection (a)(3) and subsection (a)(4)a. of this section. 
3.  The following activities associated with the construction of a dock or seawall shall be exempt from permit requirements: dredging in bottom lands that exceed six feet in depth at the mean low-water line or are located further than 100 feet from the nearest mean low-water line. This exemption shall not apply if state or federal approval is required, in which event such application shall be processed in the manner provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section. 
4.  The previous subsections notwithstanding, any proposed dredge and fill project that requires a permit from the state department of environmental protection under F.A.C. 40E-4 must apply for a city permit, as set forth in subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
(5)  Expiration of permit. Permits issued under this section shall be good for one year from the date of issuance. Extensions of this period may be granted by the city manager for an additional period of six months for good cause shown where delay has not been the fault of the applicant or the applicant's agents. 
(6)  Exceptions from permit requirement. No permit for docks, mooring piles or seawalls is required under this section. However, the construction of such devices is an improvement requiring the purchase of a building permit from the city under the Florida Building Code. Upon payment of the appropriate permit fees and evidencing that all required state and federal permits have been obtained, the permit shall be issued so long as the following conditions are met: 
a.  The dock complies with all regulations provided in section 56-93 of this Code. 
b.  All seawalls are designed by a professional engineer whose name, address and official seal appears on the construction plans. However, the following construction is exempt from the requirements of design by a professional engineer: 
1.  Riprap slope protection devices, where no vertical seawall is constructed; and 
2.  Repair of existing seawalls consisting of grouting, patching or replacement of tiebacks, but not including replacement of any section parts. 
(b)  Permit fee. The fee and charge for obtaining a permit for construction or excavation under section 52-92 of this section shall be as set forth in Appendix A, Fees and Charges Schedule, to this Code, which shall be payable at the time of filing the application. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 10-6-2; Code 1994, § 114-133; Ord. No. 06-11158, § 1, 3-15-2006; Ord. No. 13-13302, § 3, 6-12-2013 ) 
Sec. 52-94. - Marina siting criteria. 
(a)  In order to ensure that any marina development is environmentally sound, certain criteria have been proposed by the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council, the county, and the state. The city criteria are adapted from their discussions. 
(b)  The following development activities shall be preferred in descending order of priority: 
(1)  Upgrade or expand existing marina facilities, providing they will meet all environmental criteria, standards and concerns. 
(2)  Develop new marinas on previously disturbed sites or on sites that historically have been used for marina-related activities. 
(3)  Develop new marinas in transitional conservation (TC) areas only if the total disturbance to the environment is minimized and all disturbance is mitigated, according to the mitigation standards and guidelines established in this land development code. The total disturbance shall include all dredge and fill activities associated with the project, including the state department of environmental protection/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetlands and isolated wetlands, and all land clearing and site alteration that disturbs native plant assemblages or communities. Maintenance dredging, as defined in section 52-93(a)(2), of existing navigational channels and waterways shall be excluded. 
(c)  All non-water-dependent marina facilities must be sited outside vital areas, in appropriately zoned areas. This includes fuel storage tanks, dry storage areas, restaurants, bait and tackle shops, ship chandlers, gazebos and all similar structures cited in the marina definition in section 44-8. 
(d)  All new marinas must provide adequate facilities, including parking, sewage pump-out facilities, potable water and appropriate shore power capable of servicing the potential mix of vessels and vessel users. Public uses shall be encouraged. 
(e)  A spill containment and cleanup contingency plan must be developed and implemented. Such a plan must address petroleum and other hazardous materials spills and discharges resulting from vessel sinking, vessel fires, fuel transfer and dispensing accidents, storage tank overfilling or leaks, and similar events, as well as inspection and enforcement provisions. 
(f)  Marinas proposed for areas zoned C or TC must demonstrate that such a development is clearly in the public interest. 
(g)  Preference will be given to marina development projects that are situated in or close to well-flushed deep channels or natural waterways. Development proposals for marinas that require extensive dredging to create and maintain entrance or flushing channels will be discouraged. 
(h)  Preference will be given to marina development projects that are sited close to the anticipated end use destination for their tenants. 
(i)  All proposals for marina development must address maintenance of water quality. Naples Bay and the Moorings Bay system are class II waters, the Gordon River, the human-made residential canals, and the various tributaries of Naples Bay are class III waters, and Dollar Bay and the inland waterway to the south are in the Rookery Bay Aquatic Preserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve, which will eventually become Outstanding Florida Waters. Water quality criteria for these classes are set forth in F.A.C. ch. 62-302, and quality of Outstanding Florida Waters is discussed in F.A.C. 62-4.242. All proposals for marina development or redevelopment must present data establishing ambient water quality conditions, and a detailed description of a monitoring program designed to ensure applicable standards are maintained. 
(j)  If applicable, the monitoring program will be coordinated with the state department of environmental protection. If water quality deteriorates within the marina basin or in immediately adjacent waters as a result of marina development (a statistically significant water or sediment quality impact is one in which the marina data differ from the background receiving body data at a significance level of P = 0.05 (H O rejected at P = 0.05) or greater), the owners or operators will be formally notified of the water quality violation and required to commence corrective action within 90 days. If corrective action is not undertaken, the operating license will be voided. In addition, the owners or operators shall be fined a reasonable amount, as decided by the city council, which shall be used by the city to undertake corrective action relating to the water quality of the site. 
(k)  Any proposed marina facility must address the city's level of service standards for Naples Bay. This analysis will include the impacts of the proposed slips to the bay and address alternate sites and sizes for the proposed marina. 
(l)  All proposals for marina development shall include a manatee protection plan, which addresses, but is not necessarily limited to, the following issues: 
(1)  Programs for education and public awareness. 
(2)  Programs for posting and maintaining manatee and vessel speed control signs. 
(3)  An analysis of the anticipated mix of vessel drafts in relation to the controlling depth of the Gordon Pass to Naples Bay navigation channel, obtained from the most recent U.S. Army Corps of Engineers channel depth survey. If deemed necessary, the marina shall provide information on vessel draft limitations to its patrons. 
(m)  The following ranking system, based on water depth and native marine habitat criteria, is hereby established to determine the number of powerboat wet slips per length of marina shoreline. The table is modified from the county marina site ranking system. A ranking of high is given to a site that has adequate water depth and access, and will not impact native marine habitats. A medium ranking is given when there is adequate water depth and access, but native marine habitat will be impacted, and when water depth is less than -4 feet MLW, but native marine habitat will not be impacted. A low ranking is given to an area that does not have adequate depth or access, and where native marine habitat will be impacted. The power boat wet slip density ranges from 1 to 18 slips per 100 feet of shoreline.

Sec. 52-96. - Moorings Bay system access channel. 
(a)  The channel dredged around the periphery of the Moorings Bay system in 1991, 20 feet in width, is hereby designated the Moorings Bay access channel. The channel is located 20 feet offshore of the shoreline, where no piers or docks were present at the time of dredging, and 15 feet offshore from any piers or docks that were present at the time of channel dredging. The channel alignment is shown on a series of aerial photographs that can be viewed in the offices of the city clerk. 
(b)  The designated 20-foot-wide channel shall not be obstructed by construction of piers, docks, mooring piles or similar structures, nor shall it be obstructed by vessels at anchor or moored to any structure, unless such obstruction has been permitted by the city. 
(c)  Exceptions related to subsection (b) of this section may be granted by the Moorings Bay taxing district advisory committee, upon petition. The petition shall be submitted to the city manager, who will prepare an evaluation for presentation to the Moorings Bay taxing district advisory committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Moorings Bay taxing district advisory committee shall evaluate the petition based upon the uniqueness of the property, determine whether a need is clearly established for encroaching into the designated channel, and determine that the remaining unobstructed channel will be of adequate width to allow passage of vessels using the channel. 
(1)  No consideration of encroachment into the Moorings Bay system access channel shall be given based upon a statement of need related to the size of the vessel to be moored to the proposed structure. 
(2)  The petition shall include the names and addresses of the adjacent neighbors and the address of all property owners' associations in whose jurisdiction the petitioner's property is located. The neighbors and property owners' associations will be notified, in writing, at the petitioner's expense, of the variance petition hearing a minimum of 15 days before the date of the advisory committee meeting. 
(d)  The decision of the Moorings Bay taxing district advisory committee shall be considered final unless a notice of appeal is filed in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. 
(e)  Notice of appeal to a decision of the Moorings Bay taxing district advisory committee shall be filed by any of the affected parties listed in subsection (c)(2) of this section, within 15 days of the date of the advisory committee meeting. The notice of appeal, the decision of the advisory committee, and a staff analysis and recommendation will be submitted to the city manager for presentation to city council within 15 days of receipt of the notice of appeal. The city manager will place the appeal on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled city council meeting. The appellant and the other affected parties will be notified, in writing, of the date of the city council meeting.

Sec. 52-151. - Applicability of article. 
    All developments and their associated activities proposed to take place in conservation areas shall be required to submit a development of significant environmental impact (DSEI) assessment for review and approval by the city. The development of significant environmental impact assessment shall be coordinated with the general development and site plan (GDSP) review process provided for in chapter 46, in addition to those other permitting processes stated elsewhere in this Code. No building permits shall be issued until the development of significant environmental impact assessment has been reviewed by staff and the city's planning advisory board and approved by the city council. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 10-8-1; Code 1994, § 114-191) 
Sec. 52-152. - Purpose of assessment. 
    The purpose of the development of significant environmental impact assessment is to encourage flexibility in the use of land, and the activities necessary to develop such uses, without delineating specific uses and activities permitted. The development of significant environmental impact assessment will ensure that the proposed uses or activities are compatible with the natural resources of the site and of the surrounding area. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 10-8-2; Code 1994, § 114-192) 
Sec. 52-153. - Waiver of assessment requirement. 
    The requirement for a development of significant environmental impact assessment may be waived by the city manager in those instances where the county, state or federal permitting procedures require a similar environmental impact assessment process, provided the assessment meets the requirements set forth in this article and is submitted for review and approval as stated in this article. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 10-8-3; Code 1994, § 114-193) 
Sec. 52-154. - Contents of assessment report. 
    The development of significant environmental impact assessment will be a detailed report describing the proposed project and its purpose. The report must be based on current data, acquired contemporaneously with other project-associated planning, and field-verifiable as to its validity.

ARTICLE VII. - FERTILIZER USE AND MAINTENANCE OF URBAN LANDSCAPES[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 17-14036 , § 1, adopted Oct. 4, 2017, amended art. VII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. VII, §§ 52-181-52-189 was entitled "Lawn and Landscape Maintenance and Content of Fertilizer," and derived from Ord. No. 08-11972, § 1, adopted Mar. 5, 2008. 

Sec. 52-181. - Purpose and intent. 
    This article regulates and promotes the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator, requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators, establishes training and licensing requirements, establishes a prohibited and restricted application period, specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer-free buffer zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions. This article requires the use of best management practices that provide specific management guidelines to minimize the negative environmental effects fertilizers and lawn maintenance debris have in and on the city and its natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, springs, lakes, estuaries, wetlands, bays, and nearshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Collectively, these waterbodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of the city and the public health. Overuse or misuse of fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, or both, can cause overgrowth of algae and other vegetation, obstructing stormwater conveyances and disrupting the natural aquatic ecosystem. Regulation of nutrients, including phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, entering city waterbodies will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality. 
(Ord. No. 17-14036 , § 1, 10-4-2017) 
Sec. 52-182. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms, and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application: 
    Applicator means any person who applies, in any manner, fertilizer to turf or landscape plants within the city as defined in this article. 
    Commercial fertilizer applicator means any person who applies fertilizer on turf or landscape plants within the city in exchange for money, goods, services, or other valuable consideration. 
    Fertilize, fertilizing, or fertilization means the act of applying fertilizer to a lawn (turf), specialized turf, or landscape plant. 
    Fertilizer means any substance that contains one or more recognized plant nutrients and promotes plant growth, or controls soil acidity or alkalinity, or provides other soil enrichment, or provides other corrective measures to the soil. 
    Heavy rain likely - heavy rain means rainfall greater than or equal to 50 mm (two inches) in a 24-hour period; and likely means the precipitation probability as used by the National Weather Service is at least 60 percent. 
    Impervious surface means a constructed surface, such as a sidewalk, road, parking lot, or driveway, covered by impenetrable materials such as asphalt, concrete, brick, pavers, stone, or highly compacted soils. 
    Institutional fertilizer applicator means any person, other than a non-commercial or commercial applicator, who applies fertilizer for the purpose of maintaining turf or landscape plants. Institutional applicators shall include, but shall not be limited to, owners and managers of public lands, schools, parks, religious institutions, utilities, industrial or business sites, and any residential properties maintained in condominium or common ownership. 
    Landscape plant means any native or exotic tree, shrub, or groundcover, excluding turf. 
    Leaching means the process by which soluble constituents are dissolved and filtered through the soil by a percolating fluid. 
    Low maintenance zone means an area a minimum of ten feet wide adjacent to waterbodies that is planted and managed in order to minimize the need for watering, mowing, etc. 
    Non-commercial fertilizer applicator means any person other than a commercial fertilizer applicator or institutional applicator who applies fertilizer on turf or landscape plants in the city, such as an individual owner of a single-family residential unit. 
    Saturated soil means a soil in which the voids are filled with water. Saturation does not require flow. For the purposes of this article, soils shall be considered saturated if standing water is present or the pressure of a person standing on the soil causes the release of free water. 
    Slow release, controlled release, timed release, slowly available, or water insoluble nitrogen means nitrogen in a form that delays its availability for plant uptake and use after application, or that extends its availability to the plant longer than a "rapid-release nitrogen" product such as ammonium nitrate or urea, ammonium phosphate or potassium chloride. 
    Turf, sod, or lawn means a piece of grass-covered soil held together by the roots of the grass. 
    Waterbody or waterbodies means any visible, standing or open body of water. This shall include, but not be limited to: municipal or private storm sewer systems, including inlets, conveyances and structures, ditches, swales, canals, creeks, rivers, streams, tidal waters, lakes, ponds, ponded water, standing water, marshes, swamps or any other body of permanent or temporary standing or visible water whether or not the waterbody is natural or man-made or contained by impervious surfaces on the bottom or sides and all wetlands and other surface waters as defined by Chapter 62-348, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) as may be amended from time to time. 
    Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and a duration sufficient to support, and under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soils [see Chapter 62-340, F.A.C., as may be amended from time to time]. 
(Ord. No. 17-14036 , § 1, 10-4-2017) 
Sec. 52-183. - Applicability. 
    This article shall be applicable to, and shall regulate any and all, applicators of fertilizer within the city unless such applicator is specifically exempted by the terms of this article from the regulatory provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 17-14036 , § 1, 10-4-2017) 
Sec. 52-184. - Timing of fertilizer application; content and application rate; impervious surfaces; buffer zones; and mode of application. 
(a)  Timing of fertilizer application. 
(1)  No applicator shall apply fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, or both, to saturated soils, or if heavy rains are forecast in the next 24 hours. 
(2)  No applicator shall apply fertilizers containing nitrogen or phosphorus to turf or landscape plants during a period of time when the National Weather Service has issued a flood watch or warning, or a tropical storm watch or warning, or a hurricane watch or warning for any portion of the city. 
(b)  Fertilizer-free zones. No fertilizer shall be applied within ten feet of any pond, stream, waterbody, lake, canal, retention area, drain or drainage ditch, wetland, or other waterbody, or within ten feet from the top of a seawall or lake bulkhead. Newly planted turf and landscape plants may be fertilized in this zone only for a 60-day period beginning 30 days after planting, if needed, to allow the plants to become well-established. Caution shall be used to prevent direct deposition of nutrients into the water. 
(c)  Low maintenance zones. A voluntary ten-foot, low maintenance, "no-mow" zone is strongly recommended, but not mandated, from any pond, stream, waterbody, lake, wetland or from the top of a seawall. A swale or berm system is recommended for installation at the landward edge of this low maintenance zone to capture and filter runoff. No mowed or cut vegetative material may be deposited or left remaining in this zone or deposited in the water. Care should be taken to prevent the over-spray of aquatic weed products in this zone. 
(d)  Fertilizer content and application rate. 
(1)  Fertilizers applied to turf within the city shall be applied in accordance with requirements and directions provided by Rule 5E-1.003, F.A.C., as may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  Fertilizer applied to turf or landscape plants within the city must contain no less than 50 percent slow release nitrogen per guaranteed analysis label; guaranteed analysis and label are defined in F.S. Ch. 576, as may be amended from time to time. 
(3)  Fertilizer applied to landscaping plants, excluding turf, shall not be applied at a rate greater than one pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet per application. No more than four pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet shall be applied to any landscaped area, excluding turf, in any calendar year. 
(4)  Fertilizer containing nitrogen shall not be applied before seeding or sodding a site and shall not be applied for the first 30 days after seeding or sodding, except when hydro-seeding for temporary or permanent erosion control in an emergency, such as wildfire, or in accordance with the stormwater pollution prevention plan for that site. 
(5)  Fertilizers should be applied to turf or landscape plants at the lowest rate necessary without exceeding the maximum rate per application, as provided in this article, unless a soil or tissue deficiency has been verified by an approved test. Soil testing must be performed at a University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Services (UF/IFAS) Extension Soil Testing Laboratory, a state-certified or other laboratory pre-approved by the city manager. 
(6)  Phosphorus fertilizer shall not be applied at application rates that exceed 0.25 lbs. P 2 O 5 /1,000 ft. 2 per application and not to exceed 0.50 lbs. P 2 O 5 /1,000 ft. 2 per year. The use of no phosphorus fertilizer is strongly encouraged, as Florida soils typically contain sufficient phosphorus for a healthy native or man-made landscape. 
(7)  The use of water from a reclaimed wastewater system must be in accordance with this article and required best management practices; if fertilizer other than that contained in the reclaimed water is to be applied, the cumulative nutrient loading shall not exceed those established in this article. 
(e)  Application practices. 
(1)  Spreader deflector shields are required when fertilizing via rotary (broadcast) spreaders. Deflectors must be positioned such that fertilizer granules are deflected away from all impervious surfaces, fertilizer-free zones and waterbodies, including wetlands. 
(2)  Fertilizer shall not be applied, spilled, or otherwise deposited on any impervious surfaces. 
(3)  Any fertilizer applied, spilled, or deposited, either intentionally or accidentally, on any impervious surface shall be immediately and completely removed to the greatest extent practicable. 
(4)  Fertilizer released on an impervious surface must be immediately contained and either legally applied to turf or any other legal site, or returned to the original or other appropriate container. 
(5)  In no case shall fertilizer be washed, swept, or blown off impervious surfaces into stormwater drains, ditches, conveyances, or waterbodies. 
(f)  Management of grass clippings and vegetative matter. In no case shall grass clippings, vegetative matter, and/or vegetative debris be washed, swept, or blown off into stormwater drains, ditches, conveyances, waterbodies, wetlands, sidewalks or roadways. Any material that is accidentally so deposited shall be immediately removed to the maximum extent possible. Grass clippings should be blown back onto lawn areas or removed.

However, any portion of land which has been divided or subdivided (the "subdivided plat") from another larger tract of land (the "entire original tract") and which meets all of the following criteria may be platted upon approval of the city: 
(1)  The subdivided plat complies with the provisions of this Code and any applicable provisions of the comprehensive plan and this Code; 
(2)  The subdivided plat, by itself or in combination with an adjacent parcel of land under common ownership or control, abuts a public street or a city council-approved vehicular access easement which provides the exclusive means of access to the subdivided plat; 
(3)  The subdivided plat, by itself or in combination with an adjacent parcel of land under common ownership or control, meets the criteria for approval under section 54-31 for a subdivision plat of the subdivided plat, whether or not the entire original tract is then seeking or has previously obtained approval under section 54-31 for a subdivision plat; 
(4)  The only portion of the entire original tract for which a permit is then being requested in conjunction with a petition for approval under section 54-31 for a subdivision plat is the subdivided plat; and 
(5)  The portion of the entire original tract for which approval under section 54-31 for a subdivision plat is not then being sought or has not previously been obtained abuts a public street or a city council-approved vehicular access easement; and 
(6)  New construction proposed for permitting of four or more units in multiple family districts or new development in non-residential districts shall meet minimum yard requirements to all platted lot lines and shall not straddle or cover platted lot lines or easements. 
(c)  It shall be ineffective for the purposes of this Code for any person to transfer, sell, or otherwise convey any land by reference to, exhibition of, or other use of a plat of a subdivision of such land without having submitted a final subdivision plat of such land for approval as required by this chapter and without having recorded the approved final subdivision plat as required in this chapter. 
(d)  No approval of the final subdivision plat, improvement plans or authorization to proceed with construction activities in compliance with the same shall require the city to issue a development order or building permit if: 
(1)  It can be shown that issuance of said development order or building permit will result in a reduction in the level of service for any public facility below the level of service established in the city comprehensive plan; or 
(2)  Issuance of said development order or building permit is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. 
    Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, all subdivision and development shall comply with city ordinances regarding adequate public facilities.

(1)  The reinstating of lots in the same locations, of the same sizes, and with the same dimensions as platted lots previously approved by the city as part of a recorded subdivision plat. 
(2)  In the case of a subdivision plat where the individual lots shown on the subdivision plat do not meet the dimensional requirements of the underlying zoning or in the case of unplatted lands, a single-family residentially zoned parcel may be split to create a new lot, provided that it meets the dimensional and performance standards of the underlying single-family zoning district. 
(3)  In the case of a subdivision plat where the individual lots shown on the subdivision plat meet the dimensional requirements of the underlying zoning, single family residentially zoned parcels may be split to create a new lot provided that it results in the same or fewer number of lots than provided on the subdivision plat and that each lot meets the dimensional and performance standards of the underlying single-family zoning district. 
(4)  The subdivision solely for the creation, moving or removal of easements. 
(5)  The reconfiguration of parcels in the R1-15A Zoning District in conformance with Code Section 58-114 and in conformance with the requirements set forth in this chapter. 
(6)  The minor subdivision of property that does not meet the above standards shall require city council approval.

A petition to name or rename an existing right-of-way may also be initiated by the following: 
a.  By direction of the city council; 
b.  By request of the county, emergency services, United States Postal Service, or property appraiser's office; 
c.  By submittal of a petition signed by the owners of 51 percent of the property fronting the right-of-way as measured along the linear feet of the private property fronting the right-of-way. 
(2)  Upon receipt of a petition or direction of the city council to name or rename a platted right-of-way, the city manager shall process the request, obtain clearance from the county, emergency services, the United States Postal Service, and the property appraiser's office and provide notice to all owners of property abutting the right-of-way 30 days prior to consideration of the request by the city council. The city council may approve a new name provided it has been cleared by all relevant agencies and meets the criteria outlined in subsection (b)(3) of this section. After approval by the city council, all appropriate agencies shall be notified of the change, and all maps, plats, and addressing shall be amended to be consistent with the change and/or deemed amended for all official purposes. 
(3)  Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others existing and named shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, and the fact that the name is sought to be distinguished only by employing a different designation of the type of public way, such as street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court and the like, shall not suffice.

(l)  Enforcement. Responsibility for the enforcement of this section shall be the duty of the building official. 
(m)  Location permit. In those instances where compliance with the location or height requirements of this section will prevent reasonable signal reception, an exception to the regulations of this section may be requested through the submission of an antenna location permit. Exceptions to the height and location requirements of this section shall be considered only when it is demonstrated that reception will be impaired across a broad range of transmission sources. The inability to receive signals from a specific source shall not be considered adequate justification for an exception from this section. 
(1)  Required submittals. All antenna location permit applications shall include: 
a.  A completed application form. 
b.  A site plan indicating the location of the antenna as well as all structures and vegetation both on and off the site which have an impact on the antenna location requirements.

Following the public hearing, the planning advisory board may vote to deny, approve, or approve with conditions any application for an antenna location permit through a majority vote of the members present. The planning advisory board action shall be final unless an appeal is filed by the applicant or a neighboring property owner with the city manager within 10 days of the planning advisory board action. 
(4)  Appeal. In the case of an appeal, the city council shall hold a public hearing to review the planning advisory board's decisions regarding antenna location permits and render a final decision. In case of such an appeal, notification letters in accordance with subsection (m)(2)b of this section shall be sent to all adjacent property owners. 
(5)  Criteria for approval. An antenna location permit shall be granted only in those instances where the applicant demonstrates that: 
a.  Reasonable reception cannot be achieved within the height and location requirements contained within subsections (g) and (j) of this section; 
b.  The reasons why reasonable reception cannot be achieved within the required height and location requirements of this section are beyond the control of the applicant; 
c.  The exception from location and height requirements is the minimum required for reasonable reception and produces the least visual intrusion on adjacent properties, public rights-of-way, canals and water bodies of all technically acceptable alternatives; and 
d.  The proposed installation is safe.

(3)  Flagpoles, play equipment, wires, lights, mailboxes, and outdoor furniture are not considered yard encroachments. 
(4)  Arbors, trellises or pergolas in multiple-family and single-family districts, excluding the R1-15A district.

ARTICLE III. - STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 56-81. - Applicability of article. 
    The standards set out in this article shall be applicable to residential districts. 
(Code 1994, § 110-81) 
Sec. 56-82. - Affordable housing. 
(a)  Definition. For purposes of this section, the term "affordable housing" is defined as housing which is available for citizens with income which does not exceed 65 percent of the adjusted family median income standards for the metropolitan area as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. These figures shall be made available by the city manager. At least 40 percent of housing units built under the development standards listed in this section must be available to low-income citizens with incomes below 65 percent of the adjusted family median income. In addition, 30 percent of these units should be available to families of moderate income, which is 65 percent to 80 percent of the adjusted family median income. 
(b)  Purpose. The housing standards set out in this section are provided to promote, encourage and provide incentives for the development of affordable housing. The city recognizes that a variety of tools are needed to provide for affordable housing and that this is only 1 such tool. These standards are less restrictive than other density standards and more restrictive with open space and landscaping. They encourage development savings per unit by reducing land needed per unit and reducing construction costs. Therefore, it is intended that these savings be realized in the rental costs and that these units be available for low-income and moderate-income citizens. These standards apply to rental units only. This section supersedes other development standards for multifamily zoning if development is for affordable housing as defined in this section. 
(c)  Landscaping. Additional landscaping in addition to that required by chapter 58 shall be provided to define open space areas and serve as a neighborhood buffer from increased density. This will be reviewed through specific site plans. 
(d)  Open space. Open space and recreational amenities shall be provided, as appropriate, to meet the needs of the residents within each development. 
(e)  Development standards. Development standards shall be the same as the existing R3-12 multifamily zoning district with a maximum density of 16 units per acre. In addition, other development standards aside from those in the R3-12 zoning district may be proposed relevant to height, yards, lot coverage and parking in the required PD planned development rezone process for this type of development. Any proposed variation from these standards shall be reviewed for neighborhood compatibility. 
(f)  Plan review and approval. Development which utilizes these standards must be approved through a planned development rezoning process and include elevation and perspective drawings as well as site plans which will consider the degree of neighborhood compatibility and the use of landscaping as an adequate buffer. Compatibility will be a primary consideration for approval. To expedite development review time, preapplication meetings are required between the community development department and the developer to review subdivision, site plan designs and landscaping. 
(g)  Rental standards. The following standards will be a requirement for this type of development. They regulate 2 areas for rental housing: maximum yearly income for renters and maximum rental lease rates. 
(1)  Rental lease rates shall be at affordable rates as proposed in the review and approval process. Yearly rental rates shall be no greater than 30 percent of the upper annual income limits of lower income families for the metropolitan area as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The rental rates shall be based on the following table: 
Units Maximum Rental Rates 1-bedroom units 30% of 1-person family yearly income 2-bedroom units 30% of 2-person family yearly income 3-bedroom units 30% of 3-person family yearly income  
The formula for 1-bedroom units is as follows: 1-bedroom unit monthly rent equals HUD lower income limit for 1-person family times 30 percent divided by 12 months. Rental rates may be adjusted automatically based upon adjustments to median family income. An increase in rental rates beyond the standards set out in this section may be allowed subject to administrative approval of the city manager provided a hardship exists on the part of the landlord as related to expenses which are greater than effective gross income. Such an increase may be deferred to the city council for final approval at a public hearing with notice given to the affected tenants. 
(2)  An analysis must be provided on the cost, sale and rental price of the project. 
(3)  As part of the planned development approval, an annual copy of leases and income verification statements from renters will be submitted to the city manager for compliance review with the standards set out in this section. 
(4)  This development shall be subject to these conditions for a minimum of 15 years, regardless of ownership of the units. Development approval is subject to a contract between the city and the developer based on the standards set out in this section. 
(h)  Waiver of fees. Administrative planning review and building permit fees will be waived for development petitions submitted under the criteria set out in this section.

Sec. 56-84. - Bed and breakfast conditional use criteria. 
(a)  Definition. For purposes of this section, the term "bed and breakfast" means a use subordinate to and included in a single-family residential dwelling unit, personally and physically operated and occupied by the owner, or a cottage or cottages located on the same property, in which transient guests, in return for payment, are provided a sleeping room and only breakfast.

    Sponsoring agency means an agency or unit of government, a profit or nonprofit agency, or any other person or organization which intends to establish or operate a community residential home. 
(b)  Homes of six or fewer residents which otherwise meet the definition of a community residential home shall be deemed a single-family unit and a noncommercial, residential use for the purpose of this land development code. Homes of six or fewer residents which otherwise meet the definition of a community residential home shall be allowed in single-family or multifamily zoning districts without approval by the city, provided that such homes shall not be located within a radius of 1,000 feet of another existing such home with six or fewer residents. Such homes with six or fewer residents shall not be required to comply with the notification provisions of this section; provided, however, that the sponsoring agency or the department notifies the city manager at the time of home occupancy that the home is licensed by the department. 
(c)  (1)  When a site for a community residential home has been selected by a sponsoring agency in an area zoned for multifamily, the agency shall notify the city manager in writing and include in such notice the specific address of the site, the residential licensing category, the number of residents, and the community support requirements of the program. Such notice shall also contain a statement from the district administrator of the department indicating the need for and the licensing status of the proposed community residential home and specifying how the home meets applicable licensing criteria for the safe care and supervision of the clients in the home. The district administrator shall also provide to the city manager the most recently published data compiled that identifies all community residential homes in the district in which the proposed site is to be located. The city manager shall review the notification of the sponsoring agency in accordance with this land development code. 
(2)  Pursuant to such review, the city manager may: 
a.  Determine that the siting of the community residential home is in accordance with this land development code and approve the siting. If the siting is approved, the sponsoring agency may establish the home at the site selected. 
b.  Fail to respond within 60 days. If the city manager fails to respond within such time, the sponsoring agency may establish the home at the site selected. 
c.  Deny the siting of the home.

(f)  A dwelling unit housing a community residential home established pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same local laws and ordinances applicable to other noncommercial, residential family units in the area in which it is established. 
(g)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the authority of any community residential home lawfully established prior to October 1, 1989, to continue to operate. 
(h)  Nothing in this section shall permit persons to occupy a community residential home who would constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of other persons or whose residency would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.

Sec. 56-91. - Guest units and cabanas. 
    The purpose of this section is to limit the number of dwelling units permitted as accessory to primary units on single-family zoned property. 
(a)  Definitions. 
Cabana means a habitable space not exceeding 400 square feet in area or more than two rooms that may include living space and a bathroom. A cabana may include a sink but shall not include cooking facilities. 
Dwelling unit means a single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation. 
Guest unit means an accessory dwelling unit on the same property as a permitted primary residence or any assemblage of rooms functionally detached from the primary residence. Garages, utility sheds, open air shelters, pool baths, cabanas and similar structures not to be used for habitation shall not be considered guest units. 
(b)  Required lot size. 
(1)  In the R1-E district, one guest unit is permitted. Additional guest units may be permitted as a conditional use and must be approved by the process provided in section 46-34. Guest units may exceed one habitable story. The habitable floor area of all guest units on the site shall not exceed 40 percent of the habitable floor area of the principal dwelling. No single guest unit shall exceed 2,200 square feet. 
(2)  On lots 30,000 square feet and greater, one guest unit may be constructed as a permitted accessory structure. Additional guest units may be permitted as a conditional use and must be approved by the process provided in section 46-34. The guest unit may exceed one habitable story. Said guest unit's habitable floor area shall not be more than 40 percent of the principal dwelling's habitable floor area. 
(3)  A guest unit limited to one habitable story, located on the first or second floor, may be permitted in R1-15A, R1-15, and R1-10 zoning districts, on lots less than 30,000 square feet in size, through the conditional use process according to section 46-34, provided the following additional criteria are met: 
a.  The proposed lot must contain 175 percent of the required minimum lot size for the zoning district in which it is located.

(c)  Use of guest units. 
(1)  No guest unit may be used for commercial purposes except as provided for in this subsection. Leasing or renting a guest unit except in conformance with this section shall constitute a violation of the zoning ordinance. Similarly, if a main residence is leased or rented, a guest unit accessory to it may not be occupied by the property owner or leased separately from the principal dwelling since that would constitute unlawful use of single-family zoned property for two-family dwelling purposes. 
(2)  A property owner who has a guest unit built prior to January 1, 1994, and is renting said guest unit, may receive a permit from the city manager to continue the commercial use of that guest unit. Said rental permit program shall be reviewed in January 1995. 
Rental rate and occupancy characteristic information may voluntarily be provided to the city in order for the city to obtain credit for the guest units which meet the affordable housing criteria. 
(d)  Renovation of nonconforming guest units. Existing guest units which are nonconforming due to use, size or placement on the lot may be renovated provided that said renovations do not act to increase any nonconformity and are otherwise in compliance with the standards of this section. The addition of a second story within any required setback area shall be considered an increase in nonconformity. 
(e)  Cabanas. In any single-family zone one detached cabana, not directly accessible from the interior of the primary residence, may be permitted per property.

(a)  Definitions. As used in this section: 
    Boat lift means any mechanical structure capable of lifting or raising a vessel clear of the water, and shall include one or more davits, overhead systems that lift vessels using detachable cables or slings, and cantilevered and pile-supported cradle or platform systems. 
    Catwalk means a fixed structure no more than two feet in width installed to provide cleaning, repair, or other labor-related access to a moored vessel or boat lift. 
    Floating vessel platform and floating boat lift have the same meaning and have the same meaning as provided in F.S. § 403.813(2)(s). 
    Pier (or dock) means any structure, whether floating or fixed in position, except for a floating vessel platform, to which a vessel can be moored including a walkway that affords access to a vessel from the adjacent upland property. It includes all portions of the structure, including pilings and boat lifts and associated mooring piles. For the purpose of this section, "pier" and "dock" are synonymous. 
    Rafting (or double-berthing) means mooring or securing a vessel waterward of another vessel. 
    Shore-normal means extending at a right angle, or perpendicular, from the alignment of the shoreline. 
    Shore-parallel means extending along the water's edge and parallel to the direction of the shoreline. 
    Walkway means a structure installed to provide a pedestrian connection from land to an offshore pier or to a vessel moored to a pier. 
    Waterward means away from land and is generally in the direction of open water. 
    Waterway means the area of open water from shoreline to shoreline at mean high water. 
(b)  General standards. 
(1)  These standards apply to all single family residential piers and multi-family residential piers. Multi-family piers with ten or more slips are subject to these standards where applicable. Additional standards pertaining to boat shelters are contained in section 56-53 of this Code. 
(2)  No pier shall be permitted that interferes with the right to navigate safely within the waterways of the city. 
(3)  Rafting to a moored vessel shall not be allowed, except where a permit is issued after determination that the rafting will not interfere with navigation, neighboring piers, or view of the waterway from neighboring properties. 
(4)  The shore-parallel dimension of a pier shall not exceed the width of the rear yard, less the side yard setback dimensions for the subject zoning district. This restriction on encroachment into each side yard shall apply to both fixed and floating piers, and to boat lifts and vessels. 
(5)  The shore-normal dimension of a pier shall be restricted to a size such that the combined width of the pier, pilings, lift and vessel to be moored to the pier does not exceed 25 percent of the distance across the waterway at the point where the pier is located. 
(6)  Walkways shall not exceed five feet in width. 
(7)  If a proposed pier is located above or adjacent to submerged natural resources, the applicant shall make a reasonable effort to avoid, minimize or mitigate potential negative impacts to those resources. The city shall use available maps to determine the location of existing natural resources. 
(8)  No pier or boat lift will be constructed which inhibits the use or function of a neighboring pier or boat lift. 
(9)  The addresses of waterfront properties, fronting on navigable waterways, shall be permanently and conspicuously placed on a pier, seawall or separate post adjacent to the waterway. The address shall consist of arabic-styled reflective numerals at least 4 inches high and located so that they are visible and legible from the waterway. 
(10)  Floating vessel platforms are permitted in accordance with section F.S. § 403.813(2)(s). A permit shall be required for each such device to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. 
(c)  Standards for specific subdivisions. 
(1)  Aqualane Shores, including Phillip G. Rust Development, Elliott Subdivision, Marina Shores Replat, and Kluck Subdivision. 
a.  Side yard setback for piers, boat lifts, and vessels is seven and one-half feet. 
b.  Shore-normal dimension for a pier shall not exceed the smaller of 15 feet or ten percent of the waterway width, whichever is more restrictive. For a boat lift or a combined pier and boat lift, the dimension shall not exceed the smaller of 25 feet or 25 percent. Freestanding mooring piles or dolphins shall comply with the same offshore dimension restriction as for boat lifts. 
(2)  Golden Shores and Oyster Bay. The following standards apply to piers, vessels, and boat lifts. 
a.  In canals 60 feet or less in width, a pier, moored vessel, and vessel/lift combination cannot exceed 25 percent of the width of the waterway adjacent to the subject property. 
b.  In canals greater than 60 feet in width a 32-foot-wide centerline channel shall be maintained and a pier, moored vessel, and vessel/lift combination cannot exceed 50 percent of the remaining channel width adjacent to the subject property. 
(3)  Coquina Sands and the Moorings. 
a.  Any combination of piers, walkways and pilings may be constructed on each single family residential property provided that: 
1.  The structures do not encroach on the waterward extension of the required side yard setbacks; and 
2.  The combined shore normal dimension of the stationary structures and vessel, as measured waterward of the property, does not exceed 25 percent of the width of the waterway; and 
3.  The waterward dimension of all stationary structures, excluding pilings and open lifts, shall not exceed 30 feet; and 
4.  The total surface area of all stationary structures does not exceed 35 percent of the area contained between the side setback lines and the allowable shore normal boundary described in subsections 2 and 3. 
b.  Within the Moorings Subdivision, there are 11 platted lots with shorelines less than 45 feet in length (Unit 2, Block J, Lots 5, 29, 30, 36 and 37, Block Q, Lots 14 and 15, and Unit 7, Block Q, Lots 29, 30, 59, and 61). For those properties, the side yard setback restriction shall not apply. 
(4)  Park Shore, Units 1, 3, and 4. Piers shall not extend beyond the platted wharf limit line, said line being platted 15 feet off shore from the platted seawall and property line. Mooring piles, catwalks and open boat lifts can be located off shore of piers. 
(5)  Port Royal. The pier restrictions for Port Royal are contained in section 58-121, and are part of the regulations for the R1-15A zone. In summary, they establish a 20-foot side yard setback for piers, lifts, piles, vessels on lifts and an 22-foot extension into the waterway from the toe of the revetment for all piers and lifts. If environmental conditions dictate a greater extension, the side yard setback increases two feet for every additional foot off shore the structure must extend. 
(6)  Royal Harbor. 
a.  All interior canals and waterways. The shore-normal dimension for a pier shall not exceed the platted property line, said line being five feet off shore from the platted seawall line. There shall be no restriction on vessel width or beam. 
b.  Properties facing Naples Bay and Haldeman Creek. The exposed location of these properties, and the interactions of the wake-generated waves by reflection off vertical bulkheads, often dictate a shore-normal positioning of piers and boat lifts. Shore-normal dimensions shall be governed by the proximity of the primary and secondary navigation channels, the shore-parallel shoal, and the existing line of construction. 
(d)  Exceptions. In consideration of the fact that numerous canals and waterways have undulating, nonparallel shorelines, and dead-end areas where platted lots have minimal waterfront footage, exceptions to the side yard setback or the shore-normal dimension may be granted, upon approval of the city manager, in consultation with the property owner, the affected neighbors, and the subdivision property owners' association, if applicable. Decisions of the city manager are administrative decisions, and appeals of such decisions shall be pursued as set forth in section 2-84. 
(e)  Application requirements. 
(1)  Applications for the construction of a pier shall be filed with the city manager and shall include drawings and information indicating the relevant dimensions of the pier, and of the boat lift, if any; distance to the property lines; width of the waterway and size of the vessel to be moored. Fees, where applicable, shall be established by council resolution and shall be paid at the time of filing of the application. 
(2)  The city manager may permit modification of the dimension and location criteria upon receipt of a written request by or on behalf of a person with a disability. The request shall describe the extent of modification needed to accommodate the disability. The request may be made with the application or thereafter, without additional fees. 
(3)  Prior to final inspection and approval of a new pier, a post-construction survey shall be required. Repairs of existing piers, replacement of pilings or addition to an existing pier shall not be subject to this requirement unless determined to be necessary by the city manager to ensure compliance with applicable codes and regulations.

lot area) First 5,000 48 Next 5,000 35 Next 10,000 24 Next 30,000 20 Next 50,000 15 Thereafter 2  
(c)  Exceptions are as follows: 
(1)  Roof overhangs. The first 18 inches of roof overhang shall not be counted against maximum building area. Roof overhangs are subject to side yard setback requirements in their entirety. 
(2)  Screen enclosures. Screen pool enclosures, lanais and other similar structures, which may be roofed but are open on at least one side, and which are no higher than 15 feet above the minimum flood elevation, shall be included in building area calculations at 50 percent of their actual square footage. Such structures which are taller than 15 feet for any portion of their roof height shall be counted 100 percent against maximum building area for their entire floor area. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-2.1(J); Code 1994, § 102-120; Ord. No. 99-8638, § 1, 9-15-1999) 
Sec. 58-121. - Pier location and dimensions. 
    Within the R1-15A district, piers are permitted accessory structures at all developed, waterfront residential properties, subject to the following restrictions and standards: 
(1)  Piers cannot be covered. 
(2)  Pier and walkway elevation cannot exceed the elevation of the natural grade of the upland property adjacent to the pier, and no pile, pile cap, nor boat lift structure can be elevated more than plus 10.5 feet MHWL. 
(3)  The side yard setback for all piers, including floating piers, pilings, vessels moored to piers, boat lifts, and vessels supported on boat lifts, constructed after September 15, 1999, the effective date of Ordinance No. 99-8638, is 20 feet from the side property lines and riparian lines, extended into the waterway. The setback shall be measured at a right angle to the extended property line. 
(4)  The most waterward edges of piers, including lift systems, shall not extend more than 22 feet waterward of the toe of the riprap revetment (the largest original stones at the bottom of the existing riprap), with the following exceptions: 
a.  Piers on Naples Bay and Gordon Pass may extend beyond 22 feet in order to reach a maximum depth of five feet, mean low water, which is the maximum depth for maintenance dredging, as defined in F.A.C. 62-312.050(1)(e). The most waterward edge of the pier, pilings or lift cannot extend beyond this point. Depth shall be determined by an independent third party licensed surveyor using NAVD 88 and measurements shall be taken no more than every five feet starting at the toe of the riprap. 
1.  For every one foot beyond the 22-foot limit that the pier extends, the side yard setback shall increase by two feet for the entire length of the pier and pilings, including anything attached to them. 
2.  If the increased setback results in a pier that is centered along the rear property line and the length of the pier is still inadequate to provide a depth of five feet MLW, the pier can be extended the additional distance needed to provide a depth of five feet MLW. A pier is considered to be centered when the combined mass of pier and vessel moored to it are positioned opposite the midpoint of the rear property line. 
3.  A dock that is centered must be a shore normal pier and lift system. No parallel piers or lifts are permitted beyond 22 feet waterward of the toe of the riprap revetment. 
4.  The maximum shore-parallel width of the pier and lifts shall not exceed 25 percent of the shore-parallel length of the waterfront property line. 

Figure 4. Permitted Dock Location
b.  Piers may extend beyond 22 feet only if the permit applicant demonstrates to the city manager, by depth survey and bottom habitat characteristics, that such an extension is necessary to preserve productive intertidal and subtidal habitat. The distance extended off-shore shall be governed by the width of the habitat to be preserved, thus limited maintenance dredging may also be needed to achieve adequate depth waterward of the pier. For every one foot beyond the 22-foot limit that the pier extends, the side yard setback shall increase by two feet for the entire length of the pier and pilings including anything permanently attached to them. 
c.  Off-shore mooring piles, limited to two, with widths or diameters no greater than 14 inches, located a maximum of 20 feet waterward of a pier, are permitted at all properties fronting Naples Bay and Gordon Pass, and at certain other locations, as indicated on the Port Royal Association, Inc., Map, labeled "Exhibit F, Area Map Showing Specific Properties which are Permitted to Have Mooring Pilings 30 Feet From Shoreline," incorporated herein, and on file at the city offices. Off-shore mooring anchors may be installed so long as the mooring pennants are submerged and do not create a hazard to navigation. 
d.  For lots 1 and 2 in Old Harbour Cove and lots 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 in Cutlass Cove which are in dead-end coves where extended property lines converge, the following rules apply: 
1.  Piers shall be positioned as close to the toe of the riprap as possible. 
2.  Lifts may be positioned on the ends of the piers, or along the off-shore side. 
3.  Outboard walkways accessible from the pier are prohibited. 
4.  The side setback shall be 12.5 feet from the side property lines extended into the waterway for all portions of the pier, pilings, boatlift and vessel. 
(5)  Pile and beam supported boat lifts shall be subject to the same regulations as fixed and floating piers. Lift systems are allowed only on the inshore sides of piers, or in a shore-normal alignment. Side yard setback restrictions shall apply to any vessel stored on a lift. If the city manager considers it environmentally necessary to install a lift system on the off-shore side of a pier, in excess of the 22-foot limit, the lift system shall be freestanding, without additional pier or catwalk structures attached to it, and for every one foot beyond the 22-foot limit that the lift extends, the side yard setback shall increase by two feet. An offshore lift installation must comply with subsection (11) of this section. 
(6)  Pier dimensions shall not exceed the following: 
a.  Shore-normal or perpendicular walkway providing access to shore-parallel pier: Six feet in width. 
b.  Shore-normal pier: Eight feet in width. 
c.  Shore-parallel pier: Eight feet in width. The maximum length of a shore-parallel pier cannot exceed 100 feet as measured parallel to the shore. Maximum dockage per property shall not exceed a combined 100 feet in length as measured parallel to the shore. 
d.  Catwalk providing access to side of vessel, boat lift, or mooring pile: Four feet in width. 
e.  For properties containing a single dock, a dock shall be constructed within a construction envelope that is determined based on the maximum allowable size dock on a given property and in compliance with the minimum setback restrictions and pier dimensions outlined in this section (see Figures 5 and 6 below). 

Figure 5. Three examples of placement of construction envelope on a given lot

Figure 6. An example of a 60' dock built within the construction envelope on a given lot
  
(7)  A maximum of two docks per lot, as defined in section 44-8, are permitted. 
(8)  For properties containing two docks, a construction envelope determined by the maximum allowable dock per property (up to 100 feet maximum) may be applied to one dock. The secondary dock must comply with the setback requirements outlined in section 58-121 (see Figure 7). 

Figure 7. Example of a secondary dock
(9)  No piers or other over-water structures of any kind shall be permitted on Lantern Lake or Half Moon Lake. 
(10)  All proposed piers and docks shall be reviewed by the city manager to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and habitat preservation. 
(11)  Any proposed expansion of or addition (including boat lifts) to an existing nonconforming pier or dock shall require that all portions of the existing dock be brought into conformance with the requirements of this article. Total replacement of a dock requires conformity with current code. Replacement of decking material or replacement of piles within the existing footprint shall be exempt from the requirements of this article. 
(12)  No combination of pier or dock, moored vessel, or boat lift shall exceed 25 percent of the width of the waterway adjacent to the subject property. If no vessel beam is specified in the permit application a beam of 13 feet shall be assumed. In consideration of the fact that some waterways have irregular, nonparallel shorelines, the aforementioned 25 percent may have to be reduced in order to ensure that a minimum centerline channel width of 50 percent of the waterway width is maintained for the length of the subject property. Navigation in both marked and unmarked channels shall not be hindered. 
(13)  Applications to modify or construct piers or docks and boat lifts shall be accompanied by a scaled, plan-view drawing superimposed on a scaled survey showing the subject shoreline and the neighboring shorelines and piers. The elevations of the proposed walkways, piers, and piles and the distance to the opposite shoreline shall also be provided. Applications requesting encroachments under subsection (4)b. of this section shall include the necessary depth profiles presented on a cross-section drawing, and the required environmental information.

On vacant or redeveloping lots the restoration shall be at a slope not to exceed one foot vertically for every two feet horizontally (1:2). On developed lots the restoration can be at the existing slope. Any proposed placement of fill beyond the existing toe of the riprap is considered a dredge and fill activity and it requires permits from the city council, the state department of environmental protection, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The required recommended design for riprap repair is shown in Figure 5. Riprap repair permits must be accompanied by a scaled survey showing the existing toe stones and plotted lot line, top of riprap and mean high water line. An as-built scaled survey must be submitted prior to final building inspection.

Property owners are encouraged to screen walls and fences from street view and adjacent properties with landscaping. 
(1)  Definitions. As used in this section: 
Base point for height measurement. Outside the building envelope, the elevation at the crown of the road adjacent to the property is the base point for measurement of height. If the road slopes the length of the property, the average of the highest and lowest crown elevations shall be used as the base point. Inside the building envelope, finished grade at the entry treatment, wall or fence location is the base point for measurement. 
Building envelope means the buildable area of a property as determined by the applicable setbacks. 
Main driveway means access provided for vehicular ingress and egress. A property may have a maximum of two main driveways. Third driveways are considered subordinate to main driveways and are subject to different standards. 
Maximum height means finished height, including wall, column or post footings, caps, lighting, finials, and all other architectural embellishments, except as otherwise provided. 
(2)  Maximum entry treatment height. Height of main driveway gates, entry columns and posts shall be based upon the lot frontage distance and the distance which such entry treatment is set back from the adjacent paved travelway. A property may have a maximum of two main driveways, with a maximum of two main entry columns or posts per driveway. 
a.  Properties east of Gordon Drive. See table below for locations east of Gordon Drive. 
Minimum distance from travelway Lot frontage 20' 25' 30' Maximum permitted entry gate, column and post height measured from crown of road Less than 80' 6' 6' 6' 80'-100' 6' 7' 8' 101'-150' 7' 8' 9' 151'-200' 8' 9' 10' More than 200' 10' 11' 12'

d.  Clarification of column and post types. 
1.  At a main driveway, no more than two columns or posts shall be treated as main entry columns or posts, with such height limitations as described in the tables of subsections (a)(2)a and b above. Up to 32 inches is permitted on top of a main entry column or post to allow for finished installation of light fixtures. This shall not increase the maximum permitted height of the finished main entry column or post. 
2.  At a main driveway, no more than two columns or posts shall be treated as secondary entry columns or posts. The maximum height for such columns or posts is the greater of: four feet six inches or 50 percent of the maximum permitted height for main entry columns or posts. 
3.  Any other column or post in the front yard outside the building envelope shall be treated as a secondary column or post, with a maximum height of four feet six inches, and minimum spacing of six feet. 
e.  Third driveways and pedestrian gates. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for third driveways and pedestrian access from the street, the maximum height of a gate and no more than two entry columns or posts is six feet. 
f.  Entry transition. A transitional wall or fence area sloping downward from an entry column or post is permitted, provided that the length of such wall or fence area does not exceed 50 percent of the maximum permitted entry column or post height. Such transitional wall or fence area shall terminate at a maximum height of the greater of: four feet six inches or 50 percent of the maximum permitted entry column or post height in the case of main driveways, and shall terminate at a maximum height of four feet six inches in the case of third driveways. 
(3)  Maximum column and post width. For any columns or posts, the maximum finished width, including caps, facings, footings, and embellishments, is two feet six inches, except that the maximum finished width for main entry columns or posts with a height greater than eight feet is two feet ten inches. 
(4)  Maximum wall and fence height. 
a.  Front yard outside the building envelope. Walls and fences shall be limited to a maximum height of four feet. An additional 18 inches of metalwork that is at least 50 percent open and transparent is allowed on top of such wall or fence.

DIVISION 29. - C CONSERVATION AND TC TRANSITIONAL CONSERVATION DISTRICTS 

Sec. 58-861. - District purpose. 
    The conservation zoning district includes those areas having significant ecological, hydrological, physical or socioeconomic importance to the public. The principal consideration concerning uses within the conservation zoning district is the preservation of the natural functions and benefits of these areas while allowing natural uses and low intensity development which follows the guidelines outlined for each subcategory in this division. Preserving the integrity of these areas enhances the aesthetics and quality of life for city residents and visitors, provides a degree of natural protection against storms, helps maintain air and water quality, promotes marine and wildlife diversification and productivity and promotes soil stabilization. Therefore, development which would diminish the integrity of such areas should be avoided. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(A); Code 1994, § 102-771) 
Sec. 58-862. - District structure. 
    The conservation areas of the city shall be designated by 2 zoning districts: the conservation zoning district and the transitional conservation district. High-hazard areas are found in conservation areas and are defined as follows: "areas seaward of the most restrictive of the following: State of Florida Coastal Construction Control Line or Federal Emergency Management Agency designated Velocity zones (FEMA V zones), and erosion-prone bay frontage." 
_____
CONSERVATION AREAS 
Land Use Vital Limited Development Zoning: Conservation Transitional Conservation Includes: Marine grass beds 
Tidal swamp/marsh areas 
Freshwater swamp/marsh areas 

Class II waters 
Gulf beaches/dunes 
 High-hazard areas Marginal land 
 High-hazard areas 
 Passive recreation/open space areas 
Class III waters  
_____
Each of these districts has subcategories as listed in section 58-863. Each subcategory has its own standards, with the exception of high-hazard areas, which are regulated by the subcategories in which they are found. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(B); Code 1994, § 102-772) 
Sec. 58-863. - District subcategories. 
(a)  The conservation zoning district includes marine grass beds, tidal swamp and marsh areas, freshwater swamp and marsh areas, gulf beaches and dunes, and shorelines of class II waters. High-hazard areas are located within the gulf beach and dune system and the tidal swamp and marsh. These high-hazard areas are also within CBRA (Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982, 16 USC 3501 et seq.) areas seaward of the coastal construction control line adopted June 1989. 
(b)  The transitional conservation district includes transitional land, class III waters, and passive park, recreation and major open space areas. This district also includes high-hazard areas that are unplatted at the time of the comprehensive plan (January 1989), and non-CBRA areas seaward of the coastal construction control line (not including wetlands) which was adopted in June 1989, or any adopted change which would locate the line farther landward. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(C); Code 1994, § 102-773) 
Sec. 58-864. - Designation of districts; identification of district boundaries. 
(a)  Conservation district. The future land use designation of the conservation zoning district areas is Conservation/Vital. The zoning designation shall be "C, Conservation." These areas are considered vital lands. Development which potentially could diminish the integrity of such areas will not be permitted. 
(b)  Transitional conservation district. The future land use designation of the transitional conservation zoning district areas is Conservation/Limited Development. The zoning designation shall be "TC, Transitional Conservation." The TC district includes those areas of the coastal zone which have resource benefits, and areas which have substantial benefits that are less susceptible to adverse effects from alteration or use than is the case in the conservation zoning district. 
(c)  Identification of boundaries of TC district. Conservation/limited development areas are generally located on the future land use map. These transitional conservation lands are found within the conservation zoning district and are suitable for limited development. However, a clear boundary of these areas cannot be established without an environmental assessment. Therefore, these lands shall also be zoned C, Conservation, until such time as an environmental assessment (DSEI), a general development and site plan, and a rezone to TC are completed, which will identify the exact location and related characteristics of the transitional land. A preliminary determination of the boundary between C and TC districts will be determined by the city manager upon application by the property owner. The preliminary determination shall be based upon the appropriate regulatory line, vegetative distribution and topography. The city manager's determination may be appealed to the planning advisory board and city council. The property owner shall provide the city manager with a survey of any regulatory line, and vegetation distribution information and topography. The property owner may present a different boundary through the rezone process. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(D); Code 1994, § 102-774) 
Sec. 58-865. - Definitions and general standards. 
    The following definitions and general standards shall apply for purposes of this division: 
    Armoring (shoreline) means rigid coastal and shore protection structures such as seawalls, bulkheads, revetments, groins and breakwaters. 
    Artificially enhanced dune means a human-made mound made by placement of sand into a dune configuration and planted with dune-stabilizing vegetation. It may have a stabilizing core of sandbags. If a concrete mixture is used, sandbags may consist of only 5 percent concrete, and 95 percent sand. Sand fencing may be used to protect the newly planted dune. 
    Boardwalks means elevated wooden walkway structures. The site and construction of the boardwalk will provide for the least amount of disturbance to the natural area. The width of boardwalks in conservation areas should be minimized. Generally the following guidelines should be followed: If boardwalks lead to a public access site, then their width should be no greater than 8 feet, to allow for a small vehicle to collect trash from that area; and boardwalks for pedestrian passage only should be narrower and should not disturb an area of greater width than 5 feet. Construction should follow state department of environmental protection standards for boardwalk construction. 
    CBRA means the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 (16 USC 3501 et seq.), which designated undeveloped coastal barrier areas nationwide. 
    Clearing. 
(1)  Understory and tree removal shall be permitted only in those areas specifically required to facilitate a residential dwelling or other structure permitted through the conditional use process. Clearing of native vegetation for lakes shall be discouraged, and if unavoidable should be the minimum area required for water management. 
(2)  Clearing should not exceed the following open space ratio for each individually identified habitat type; however, the ratio may vary slightly based upon the quality and viability of the habitat and offsetting mitigation such as restoration or creation of appropriate habitats. The exact ratio for each individually identified habitat type will be determined during the development approval process. 
Habitat Type* Open 
Space 
Ratio*** Habitats of special concern 1.0 Mangroves 1.0 Freshwater wetlands 1.0 Coastal hammock 1.0 Palm hammock 0.90 Salt marsh and buttonwood association (tidal swamp/marsh areas) 0.85 Pinelands 0.80 Disturbed with exotics** 0.20 Disturbed 0.20  
*These are further defined under Habitat types in this section. 
**All exotic vegetation must be removed and 20 percent of the area must be designated as open space after replanting. 
***Does not include limited disturbance for boardwalks, beach access, nature trails etc. 
    Cluster development. A cluster development is one in which a number of dwelling units are grouped, leaving some land for common use. Residential projects of 3 or more units, or over 1/2 acre in size, may employ the concept of clustered development whereby residential units are grouped to provide a more efficient design of infrastructure and to provide usable open space for the residents. Clustered developments must comply with the density, and lot coverage requirements may be decreased provided the land thus saved is allocated to usable open space areas for the residents of the project. The maintenance of the open space areas is the responsibility of the owners. 
    Development means any proposed activity or material change in the use or character of land, including but not limited to the placement of any structure, utility, fill or site improvement on land, and any act which requires a building permit. 
    Development of significant environmental impact (DSEI). A development of significant environmental impact assessment is a site-specific analysis which includes a review of soils, natural hazards, substrata, surface water and groundwater analysis, water management, erosion, streams and water bodies, flora and fauna, archaeological and historical resources, environmental impact summary, impact on coastal barrier if applicable, beach management and mosquito control. 
    Disturbed area means land that is identified by exotic vegetation cover or by development. 
    Exotic vegetation includes Australian pines, Brazilian pepper, melaleuca and downy rose-myrtle. 
    GDSP means a general development site plan as identified in this land development code. 
    Habitat types. 
(1)  Habitats of special concern. 
a.  High-quality special vegetation area means an area characterized by the dominance, as determined by the city manager, of any of the following habitats: coastal strand, sand pine scrub community, coastal hammock, or beach and dune system. Clearing is generally not permitted. 
b.  Medium-quality special vegetation area means an area characterized by the composition of site having isolated stands which are defined as habitats of special concern. These isolated stands must be incorporated into preservation areas. 
(2)  Mangrove wetlands means a jurisdictional or isolated wetland characterized by the presence of 1 or more species of mangrove trees. 
(3)  Freshwater wetlands means areas associated with tidal swamp and marsh areas, either through streams or as transition areas between uplands and estuarine wetlands. 
(4)  Palm hammock means areas characterized by an abundance and density of thatch palms such that they are 50 percent of the dominant canopy plants. 
(5)  Salt marsh and buttonwood association means a grassy marsh area dominated by salt grasses combined with buttonwood trees (reference section 58-871). 
(6)  Pinelands means areas characterized by canopy dominance by slash pines which can be managed by prescribed burning or other forest management techniques. 
(7)  Coastal hammock means a mixed hardwood dominated plant assemblage on high ground in a coastal zone, which frequently occurs in isolated stands surrounded by wetlands. This is a habitat of special concern. 
    Intent to develop means a written document from the developer or owner of the property which explains in detail the proposed disturbance to or construction on the affected area. The document shall include acreage by natural forest community and the total acreage of the property, tree and understory survey, and a general development site plan showing the proposed development. Typically this document would accompany a rezone to TC since all conservation areas are initially zoned C. 
    Landscape replacement plan means a drawing containing proposed tree and understory removal, tree replacement planting, tree relocation and preservation areas. 
    Marina means a boat docking facility containing 10 or more slips (also see the definition in section 44-8). 
    Native plant species means plants having a geographic distribution indigenous to all or part of southwest Florida. 
    Natural forest community means assemblages of native temperate or tropical tree species and their associated understory. These assemblages shall have at least 75 percent of the number of all trees and understory species as native plant species. 
    Nature trails. Nature trails shall be aligned to a path of least disturbance to the natural area and delineated with mulch or other appropriate natural material. Generally, their width shall not exceed 4 feet in order to discourage motor vehicles. 
    Observation tower means a wooden platform designed to enable the public to see a natural area from an elevated location which does not exceed 35 feet in height. The square footage for an observation deck shall not exceed 144 square feet. 
    Open space means natural features such as trees, shrubs, grass and water with the absence of development. Landscaping as required by this land development code, or parking areas, are not considered open space. 
(1)  Natural open space means natural features and greenery completely void of any structure or development of any type. 
(2)  Passive recreation means natural features and greenery with limited human-made additions such as walkways and benches. 
(3)  Active recreation means human-made additions to natural open space which promote activity, such as swing sets, ballfields, swimming pools or recreation buildings. 
    Preservation area means portions of a site that are to be protected from alterations, such as hydrological changes that would cause longterm vegetation changes not likely to occur otherwise, and from any tree or understory removal. Preservation areas shall be naturally maintained without any development. The landowner is responsible for these areas. 
    Protective barrier means a temporary fence or other structure built to restrict passage into an area surrounding a tree or stand of trees for the purpose of preventing any disturbance to the roots, trunk or branches of the tree. 
    Storm protection. In both conservation districts, passive devices such as beach restoration or renourishment and revegetated or reconstructed dunes can be used. If core structure is required for dune reconstruction, the core shall be sandbags (reference Artificially enhanced dune ). 
    Transfer of density means the transfer of 1 unit per 5 net acres density from conservation/vital areas which are classified as high-hazard areas to immediately adjacent developable land under the same ownership. This transfer shall be focused into previously disturbed areas whenever possible and shall meet all standards of the area in which they are transferred. The transfer of density provides for density credit only for uplands within the gulf beach and dune vital areas. In no case may the density of an adjacent upland area be increased by more than 33 percent. 
    Tree means any woody or fibrous perennial plant with a trunk having a minimum diameter at breast height of 3 inches and an overall height of 12 or more feet. Diameter at breast height means the diameter of a tree's trunk measured at a position 4.5 feet above the ground surface. All specimens of mangroves shall be deemed to be trees by this definition, including seedlings, propagules and saplings. 
    Tree survey means a drawing overlaid directly upon the site plan sufficient to provide the location, plotted by accurate techniques, in relation to all proposed development, which generally identifies existing trees and tree groupings which are proposed to be destroyed, relocated or preserved. The common and scientific name of each tree species shall also be provided. The level of detail of the tree survey can be finalized with the city manager. 
    Understory means the complex of woody, fibrous, herbaceous and graminoid plant species that are typically associated with a natural forest community.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 58-866. - Submittal requirements for permitted uses. 
    Permitted uses in the conservation or transitional conservation district which involve changes or alterations to the site shall require a submittal including: 
(1)  A general development and site plan of proposed permitted use which addresses the changes to the natural area and identification; 
(2)  A tree survey; 
(3)  A site survey and flagging of preservation areas; 
(4)  Field verification by the city manager; 
(5)  A complete development of significant environmental impact assessment; 
(6)  The application fee; and 
(7)  A rezone application to TC or PD, if appropriate. A proposal to rezone to TC for property that is under 40,000 square feet in area does not require a variance to the rezone criteria, as it shall not be considered a spot zoning since it is a subcategory of conservation zoned areas. A planned development rezone must meet all submittal requirements listed in this land development code. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(F); Code 1994, § 102-776) 
Sec. 58-867. - Submittal requirements for conditional uses. 
    Submittal requirements for conditional uses in the conservation or transitional conservation district shall include:

(2)  A general development and site plan; 
(3)  Identification, survey and flagging of preservation areas; 
(4)  A tree survey and sites of proposed tree or understory removal; 
(5)  A landscape replacement plan; 
(6)  A water management plan which creates minimal impact; 
(7)  Proposed placements of protective barriers during the construction stage; 
(8)  A complete development of significant environmental impact assessment; 
(9)  The applicable fee; and 
(10)  A rezone application to TC or PD, if appropriate. A proposal to rezone to TC for property that is under 40,000 square feet in area does not require a variance to the rezone criteria. A planned development rezone must meet all submittal requirements listed in this land development code. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(G); Code 1994, § 102-777) 
Sec. 58-868. - Review of submittals by city. 
    Review by the city of information submitted pursuant to this division shall include: 
(1)  Departmental review, including site verification by the city manager. 
(2)  Public advertisement process. 
(3)  Formal staff report. 
(4)  Planning advisory board recommendation through the public hearing process. 
Final action shall be decided by the city council. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(H); Code 1994, § 102-778) 
Sec. 58-869. - Monitoring of conditional uses; violations. 
(a)  Conditional uses which are approved through the process set out in this division must be monitored for compliance every 6 months or at another appropriate interval as approved by the city council due to the environmental sensitivity of the conservation districts. Specific monitoring requirements will be stipulated in the rezone resolution. The property owner is responsible for submitting a report to the city manager that identifies the status of the conditional use. A site visit by the city manager will take place to document the monitoring report. 
(b)  Any unlawful destruction or removal of trees or understory in conservation areas, or any other action inconsistent with this chapter, is a violation of this chapter, with each tree removed being defined as a separate offense. If, after illegal clearing, the number of trees removed is impossible to determine, an estimate which is satisfactory to the city manager shall be made based on similar habitat areas. Mitigation plans accepted by the city manager are required in addition to the penalties described in this section. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(I); Code 1994, § 102-779) 
Sec. 58-870. - Marine grass beds. 
(a)  Description. Tropical seagrass communities are highly productive habitats which shelter and nourish a broad group of organisms, especially juvenile fish and crustaceans. The grasses are a food source for a variety of animals, including the endangered West Indian manatee. 
(b)  Identification. Marine grass beds should be identified on a project-by-project basis through the normal local, state and federal dredge and fill permitting procedures, bulkhead and dock construction and maintenance dredging permitting, through the general development and site plan review process, the development of significant environmental impact assessment, or the state's development of regional impact process. 
(c)  Location. Marine grass beds are found on suitable substrates off the gulf beaches and in areas of Naples and Dollar Bays where light penetration and substrate are adequate. Their exact locations are not specified at this time. 
(d)  Suitability for development. Marine grass beds are easily destroyed and are vulnerable to pollution of all types, including thermal discharges, and are particularly vulnerable to turbidity from dredging, shoreline construction and excessive wave and wake activity. Some areas may be suitable for the establishment of marine grass beds, which shall be permitted upon approval by the city manager. 
(e)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Natural propagation of sport and commercial fish; and 
(2)  Natural waterfowl and wading bird food production. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(J); Code 1994, § 102-780) 
Sec. 58-871. - Tidal swamp and marsh areas. 
(a)  Description. Tidal swamp and marsh areas include salterns, which are areas characterized by the presence of 1 or more species of wetlands plants as listed in F.A.C. 62-301.400, and below the yearly high storm elevation. High-hazard areas are also present in these areas and are referenced in section 58-873. 
(b)  Identification. Tidal swamp and marsh areas include all areas where brackish water or saltwater is contained at or above the soil surface for a sufficient period during the yearly water cycle, often resulting in the establishment of natural communities of salt-tolerant vegetation that are characteristic of wetland areas. Within the city, the predominant vegetation is 1 or more species of mangrove tree. 
(c)  Location. The general locations of tidal swamps and marshes have been identified in the Rookery Bay land use studies and the master plans for Water Management Districts 6 and 7. They occur in isolation and in association with natural and human-made waterways from Clam Bay south to Dollar Bay, often as a narrow fringe of vegetation. 
(d)  Suitability for development. Serious disturbances occur when the natural pattern of water movement through the system is altered. Structures or excavations which alter water flow could create serious disturbances to such a system. Development in such areas would destroy or diminish the system's other significant functions and benefits. 
(e)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Natural storm protection; 
(2)  Prevention of shore erosion, through natural vegetation and berms, or artificially enhanced natural features, such as mitigation revegetation; 
(3)  Natural wildlife and fisheries habitat and propagation; 
(4)  Natural water quality improvement; and 
(5)  Aesthetic enjoyment. 
(f)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Limited mangrove pruning and removal and dredging for a single-family boat dock, or educational activities; 
(2)  Limited mangrove pruning and removal for boardwalks, nature trails and observation towers (see section 58-865). 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(K); Code 1994, § 102-781) 
Sec. 58-872. - Freshwater swamp and marsh areas. 
(a)  Description. In the city urban area most freshwater wetlands are associated with tidal swamp and marsh areas, either through streams or as transition areas between uplands and estuarine wetlands. They function as aquifer recharge areas and provide a barrier to saltwater intrusion. 
(b)  Identification. Freshwater swamps and marshes are areas with water contained at or above the soil surface for sufficient time throughout the year to result in the establishment of natural communities of wetland plants as listed in F.A.C. 62-301.400. 
(c)  Location. The general locations of freshwater wetlands in the city area have been identified in the master plans for Water Management Districts 6 and 7 and in the Rookery Bay land use studies. Few undisturbed freshwater wetlands still remain within the city. Several marshes exist on Key Island and along the Gordon River, but the majority of this habitat lies further east in the county. 
(d)  Suitability for development. Freshwater swamps and marshes are sensitive to human-induced changes. The vitality of these areas is dependent upon the inflow of upland runoff. Ecological disturbances occur when the natural pattern of water movement through the system is altered by development. 
(e)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Freshwater retention, providing there is minimal disturbance to the existing system; 
(2)  Natural saltwater intrusion barrier (no alteration shall be permitted); 
(3)  Storm and flood protection, through natural vegetation and berms, or artificially enhanced natural features, such as mitigation revegetation; 
(4)  Natural wildlife habitat; and 
(5)  Aquifer recharge. 
(f)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): boardwalks, nature trails and observation towers (see section 58-865). 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(L); Code 1994, § 102-782) 
Sec. 58-873. - Gulf beaches and dunes. 
(a)  Description. Gulf beaches and dunes include ocean-fronting beaches extending landward of the mean high-water line (MHWL) and may include 1 or more low dune ridges. These areas are subject to flooding from tidal or storm surges, with superimposed velocity waves which make them unsuitable for residential development. 
(b)  Identification. The landward extent of the beach and dune system which must be protected lies between the shoreline and the coastal construction control line, as identified and established pursuant to F.S. ch. 161 and by relevant city ordinances. A site-specific survey is necessary to establish the exact position of both city setback lines, which are defined as being 150 feet landward of the mean high-water line and 75 feet landward of the vegetation line, and the position of the coastal construction control line. 
(c)  Location. The gulf beach and dune system within the city is approximately 8 miles in length and is the western land boundary of the city limits. The coastal construction control line is surveyed and referenced to fixed monuments, which are placed at approximately 1,000-foot intervals for the length of the shoreline. The FEMA V zone is plotted on the official flood insurance rate maps of FEMA. 
(d)  Suitability for development. Development within the beach and dune system is extremely hazardous due to storm surges, wind and the dynamics of natural beach erosion cycles. The destruction of native dune strand vegetation and dune areas increases erosion potential and reduces storm buffer capabilities. The most serious erosion problems along the Naples Beach have occurred in the areas where shore protection structures, primarily seawalls, were installed on or in front of the dune system. No armoring of the beach and dune system will be permitted in the CBRA area. In the remainder of the conservation zoning district, existing armoring can be maintained and new armoring may be permitted, subject to both city and state department of environmental protection variance and permitting requirements. 
(e)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Passive recreation activities which do not require a permanent structure and do not adversely impact the environment, and open space; 
(2)  Storm and erosion protection by naturally occurring features and artificially enhanced dunes (no armoring or artificial dune enhancement is permitted in the CBRA areas); 
(3)  Transfer of density (see section 58-865); a PD rezone is required for transfer of density; 
(4)  Aesthetic enjoyment; and 
(5)  Protection of dunes and dune vegetation with dune walkovers. 
(f)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): recreation activities which require a permanent structure, and land improvements, such as boardwalks, gazebos and observation towers or similar facilities, which require only minimal alteration, if such alterations are easily expendable to erosion. No alteration shall damage the beach and dune system or interfere with the natural dynamics of the beach and dune system.

Sec. 58-874. - Class II waters and their shorelines. 
(a)  Description. Class II waters are coastal saline and brackish waters which can support shellfish propagation and harvesting. 
(b)  Identification. Class II waters are identified and designated by the state department of environmental protection in F.A.C. 62-302.400. 
(c)  Location. Class II waters include Naples Bay, Dollar Bay, Clam Bay and the Moorings Bay system. 
(d)  Suitability for development. Class II waters and their bottom system are sensitive to development activities along the shoreline. Urban stormwater runoff, wastewater effluent, dredge and fill operations and boating activities can degrade water quality. 
(e)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Natural shellfish propagation and harvesting. 
(2)  Individual boat docks on single-family residentially zoned property. 
(f)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Circulation fountains, within the water, which improve the oxygen content of the water. 
(2)  Passive recreation which has minimal impact on the environment, such as boardwalks and nature trails (see section 58-865 for clarification). 
(3)  Marinas, in compliance with the city's marina siting criteria. A development of significant environmental impact assessment is required, as well as a petition for a conditional use. 
(4)  Dredging activities. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(N); Code 1994, § 102-784; Ord. No. 98-8411, § 1, 11-18-1998) 
Sec. 58-875. - Transitional conservation district. 
(a)  Purpose. The transitional conservation district shall function in part as a buffer area to ensure compatible development adjacent to the conservation zoning district. There would be little practical benefit to establish strict controls over development in the conservation zoning district while permitting indiscriminate development to occur on its boundaries. TC district areas require special precautions and attention prior to development because of their resource value, potential hazards that may exist, and their proximity and relationship to conservation zoning district areas. Failure to consider these limitations may result in direct or indirect consequences harmful to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  District structure. See section 58-862. 
(c)  District subcategories. The transitional conservation district includes transitional land, class III waters, and passive park, recreation and major open space areas. This district also includes high-hazard areas that are unplatted non-CBRA areas seaward of the coastal construction control line (not including wetlands) which was adopted in June 1989, or any adopted change which would locate the line farther landward. 
(d)  Land use and zoning designation. 
(1)  Land use designation. The land use designation for the TC district is Conservation/Limited Development. 
(2)  Zoning designation. Because of their critical environmental concern, these lands are zoned C, Conservation, which is the designation for vital lands. Within such areas, there may be smaller parcels which are suitable for limited development zoning; however, these areas cannot be clearly separated from vital lands without an environmental assessment. 
(e)  General definitions. Reference section 58-865. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(O); Code 1994, § 102-785) 
Sec. 58-876. - Transitional land. 
(a)  Description. Because of such conditions as low elevation, poor drainage or other physical restrictions, transitional lands are only marginally developable and require a major alteration in order to be made suitable for urban development. For these reasons, only recreational facilities and very low residential density uses may be reasonable developments. These areas are identified as marginal land by the comprehensive plan, adopted in January 1989. 
(b)  Identification. Transitional lands are undeveloped or relatively unimproved dry lands which are characterized by 1 or more of the following conditions: 
(1)  They are below 5 feet elevation above mean sea level (MSL or NAVD 88), and are not vital lands, according to an environmental assessment; 
(2)  They are lands contiguous to a conservation zoning district area; or 
(3)  They are lands without existing or easily provided access from developed areas. 
Transitional lands are defined by their elevation, location or accessibility. Topographic maps, soil surveys, field surveys, and local, state and federal permitting and review procedures may be used to identify these areas. 
(c)  Location. Transitional lands are found on Key Island, the east shore of Naples Bay, and both sides of the Gordon River. 
(d)  Suitability for development. 
(1)  Portions of the east shore of Naples Bay and all of Key Island are not accessible by existing improved roads. This lack of accessibility requires special consideration for providing city services, such as emergency services, garbage collection and utility services. Potential disturbance related to accessibility or services should be minimized by limiting clearing, as defined by the district provisions, and grouping utilities and other service areas. 
(2)  The physical characteristics of transitional lands are generally more tolerant relative to alteration than are conservation zoning district (vital) areas. However, there is a significant hazard of relatively frequent flooding as a result of unusually high tides or storms. 
(3)  Due to the fact that virtually all of the transitional lands are contiguous to conservation zoning district areas, any development must not threaten the integrity, diminish the benefits, or interfere with the functions of the designated Conservation zoning district areas. 
(e)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Natural water quality maintenance; 
(2)  Natural wildlife habitat; and 
(3)  Open space area. 
(f)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Passive, low intensity recreation, such as hiking footpaths, boardwalks and nature trails (see section 58-865); 
(2)  Marinas, in compliance with marina siting criteria (see section 52-94). A PD rezone is required which also meets all conditional use criteria; and 
(3)  Active recreation facilities and low density single-family or clustered residential development with typical accessory uses or structures with the following standards. A PD rezone is required which also meets all conditional use criteria. 
a.  Density shall not exceed 1 unit per 5 net acres. This may be increased only through transfer of density; see section 58-865. 
b.  Maximum cleared or disturbed area per homesite is 10,000 square feet. 
c.  Maximum building envelope is to be determined through a site check, in accordance with clearing provisions and percentage requirements applicable to specific vegetative cover of the site. 
d.  Maximum height is 35 feet. 
e.  Maximum disturbed area, excluding areas heavily impacted by exotics, shall not exceed 10 percent of the total upland portion of the TC zoned area to maintain natural communities to the greatest extent possible. 
f.  Any existing disturbed areas in a transitional conservation district shall be required to be developed before undisturbed areas. 
g.  Landscaping shall utilize xeriscape design. Native species should predominate, but xeric nonnative landscape species can be used. Existing exotic vegetation shall be removed and replaced with native vegetation. In defined habitat types, such as pinelands and palm hammocks, landscaping shall be limited to those plants that normally occur in those assemblages. 
h.  Only organic pesticides and fertilizers as approved by the city manager shall be permitted in these areas, subject to evidence of minimal impact and any monitoring required by the planned development. 
i.  Site grading is permitted within the building envelope area, and fill shall be limited to no more than 18 inches within the envelope to provide adequate drainage. 
j.  Utilities shall be grouped together to limit the disturbance to the area. The preferred method of managing sewage is central public wastewater treatment and disposal. However, if that is not physically or legally possible, then an on-site central treatment system, or, as a last resort, septic tanks, may be allowed subject to a complete development of significant environmental impact assessment which shows no adverse environmental impacts, and other local and state regulations. The development of significant environmental impact assessment should also analyze the location and density of proposed drainfield sites and shall determine the appropriate siting and number which are compatible with the natural environmental conditions. 
k.  Clearing shall be limited by the open space ratio provisions listed in the definition of "clearing" in section 58-865. 
l.  Water management provisions shall be examined by the city manager and shall achieve runoff control with absolute minimum impact to the natural area. Lakes are discouraged. 
m.  Clustered homesites are encouraged in disturbed areas in order to reduce the impact to native habitat in the entire tract. In undisturbed areas, 80 to 90 percent of the area must be left as open space, depending on the habitat in that area. 
n.  Hurricane evacuation plans shall be developed which enable the residents to evacuate as soon as possible. Evacuation plans shall address adequate shelter space. 
o.  Public expenditures for new development in coastal high-hazard areas will be limited to the few remaining existing undeveloped platted lots. 
p.  A person or organization shall be responsible for maintenance and protection of areas not included in residential lots. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(P); Code 1994, § 102-786) 
Sec. 58-877. - Passive park, recreation and open space areas within conservation areas. 
(a)  Description. Passive park, recreation and open space areas are devoted to passive outdoor recreational activities. Passive recreation is defined by the lack of permanent structures or land improvements. These areas may include passive city and county parks within the city limits, historical and archaeological sites, and privately owned lands dedicated to passive recreational use. 
(b)  Identification. Park and recreational lands in the city are typically zoned PS, Public Service, regardless of the activities present at the site. Future lands dedicated to passive park, recreation and open space shall be designated TC, Transitional Conservation. Those PS public service sites which are identified as passive park and recreation areas shall be regulated by this section. 
(c)  Suitability for development. These areas should be adequately protected from noise and air pollution and congestion caused by traffic and other uses. Noncompatible land uses within these areas can diminish the land's value for passive recreational purposes and will not be permitted. 
(d)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Aesthetics and open space; and 
(2)  Passive recreation uses which do not require a permanent structure or land improvements. 
(e)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Intensification of active recreation uses; and 
(2)  Land use buffers. 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(Q); Code 1994, § 102-787) 
Sec. 58-878. - Class III waters and their shorelines. 
(a)  Description. Class III waters include all coastal waters not otherwise classified in section 58-874, including streams, lakes, ponds and coastal water of the Gulf of Mexico, which have the capability or potential of supporting fish and wildlife propagation or water contact sports. 
(b)  Identification. Class III waters are identified and designated by the state department of environmental protection. 
(c)  Location. The Gordon River, the human-made residential canals and the various tributaries of Naples Bay are designated as class III waters. 
(d)  Suitability for development. These waters and their bottom systems are sensitive to development activities along their shoreline and adjacent upland areas. 
(e)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are as follows (see submittal requirements): 
(1)  Natural fish and wildlife propagation; 
(2)  Recreation; and 
(3)  Natural maintenance of water quality standards. 
(f)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are marinas, in compliance with the city's marina siting criteria. A development of significant environmental impact assessment is required (see submittal requirements). 
(Comp. Dev. Code 1990, § 7-4-24(R); Code 1994, § 102-788; Ord. No. 98-8411, § 2, 11-18-1998)

Sec. 58-907. - Maximum residential density. 
(a)  Generally. The maximum residential density in the downtown district is 12 dwelling units per acre, except as provided below. 
(b)  Density increases. Residential density may exceed 12 units per acre, but not greater than 30 units per acre, on a specific site by conditional use permit, subject to other conditions stated herein; however, the overall density in the district may not exceed 12 units per acre. A total pool of 807 units is available for property in the area on the north side of Central Avenue, and a total pool of 609 units is available for property in the area on the south side of Central Avenue for a total of 1,416 residential units in the district. In order to exceed 12 units per acre, a project must either provide public open space through dedication of an easement to the city, or payment into the open space fund, or a combination of both. 
(1)  Dedication of public open space. If the project provides public open space, at least 500 square feet of contiguous open space must be provided for every residential unit above the allowable number. A minimum of 1,000 square feet of contiguous open space must be provided in order to be eligible for this provision. The public open space shall remain as private property but an easement or similar instrument shall be granted to the city for use as public open space prior to issuance of a building permit. The decision as to whether to accept the dedication of public open space or to require payment in lieu of public open space shall be made by the city council. The design of the public open space must be approved by the design review board. Refer to section 58-919 for a description of the board's responsibilities. 
(2)  Payment for additional density. If the developer of the project proposes to make a payment for the increased density, an open space fee per residential unit above the allowable number must be paid to the city at the time of issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  Computation of open space fee. The city council shall by resolution adopt fees to be charged for open space and shall be as set forth in appendix A to this Code. 
(4)  Refunds. Where a project has not commenced construction after issuance of a building permit, requests for refunds of open space fees must be made in writing and will be considered on an individual basis and approved by the city council. After determination of the city council at a public meeting that the property owner is entitled to a refund, the city shall return the amount so determined. Any interest that may have been earned on such amounts shall not be refundable. 
(5)  Downtown public open space trust fund established. The Naples Downtown Public Open Space Trust Fund account is hereby established into which shall be deposited all payments made by projects pursuant to this section. Money deposited into said account shall be used by the city for the exclusive purpose of paying the cost of acquiring land and for the construction or reconstruction of public open space in the district. Said cost includes the cost of all labor and materials, the cost to acquire all lands, property, rights, and easements required, the cost of financing charges, the cost of interest prior to and during construction, and, for one year after completion of construction, discount on the sale of municipal bonds, the cost of plans and specifications, the cost of engineering and legal services, and such other costs and expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of such construction or reconstruction, administrative expenses, and such other expense as may be necessary or incident to the construction or reconstruction of public open space, or its financing.

Sec. 58-910. - Maximum building height. 
    Throughout the downtown district, the maximum height for any building, including residential, shall be limited to 3 stories and 42 feet, measured from the 1st-floor FEMA elevation to the peak of the roof or the highest point of any appurtenance attached to the roof, except where commercial property is adjacent to, or across the street or alley from, property zoned residential, buildings at the street line cannot be higher than the height permitted in the residential zone. 
(Code 1994, § 102-850; Ord. No. 03-10093, § 1, 6-18-2003) 
Sec. 58-911. - Standards for site design. 
    Sites shall be designed to incorporate safe and convenient vehicular use areas and pedestrian ways, with landscape, lighting, and signage treatments intended to result in a comprehensive design. Site design should promote the use of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) principles, including: visibility (visibility for law enforcement and other people in the area), natural surveillance (placing areas of activity where they can be seen), and defensible space (designing areas which people will take as their own and not be willing to relinquish this space to undesirable activities). Buildings shall have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest from the perspective of the pedestrian, reduce massing, recognize local character, and are site responsive. 
(1)  Uses along frontage lines: 
a.  Parking structures or buildings elevated over parking shall have occupiable ground floor space for a minimum depth of 20 feet from the frontage lines. 
b.  On corner property with a frontage line along one of the 4 commercial corridors (U.S. 41, Central Ave, 10th Street or Goodlette-Frank Road), residential 1st floors are permitted beyond a depth of 50 feet from that frontage line. On corner property fronting 2 or more commercial corridors, residential 1st floors fronting the road require conditional use approval.

(e)  Reimbursement. For developments that provide dedicated, public parking spaces over and above the required minimum parking, the developer will be reimbursed from the payment-in-lieu-of parking trust fund a sum of money equal to the product of the excess spaces and the current reimbursement cost. The determination of such excess public spaces shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  The public parking spaces shall be readily apparent to the public and have direct access to a public way. At no time shall the use of these spaces be limited by liftgates, traffic cones or other means. 
(2)  A reasonable minimum number of contiguous public spaces, sufficient to be easily interpreted as a public parking amenity, shall be provided. This reimbursement is not intended for the odd one or two excess spaces that may result in a particular development layout, but rather, is intended to reimburse a concerted effort to add to the public parking pool. 
(3)  The quantity and suitability of such excess public parking spaces is subject to the review and determination of the committee. 
(f)  Dedicated ground floor public parking. For developments that dedicate the entire ground floor of a parking structure to public parking, the developer, through the conditional use process, may be permitted to provide supplemental parking on the third floor rooftop. Rooftop parking areas shall be screened with a parapet. The structure, including the rooftop parking areas, shall be designed, landscaped and maintained so as to be compatible with surrounding structures and so as to prevent undue interference with the view from surrounding structures. 
(g)  Fees. The city council shall by resolution adopt the amount to be reimbursed for a single public parking space in the district and shall be as set forth in Appendix A to this Code. 
(h)  Excess parking. A development may construct parking in excess of that which is required by this Code, including spaces in a parking structure, in its project. The excess spaces may be leased or sold to a second development within one of the geographic areas defined in section 58-916 in which the development is located, or to the city. The leased or purchased parking may be used in meeting the parking requirements under this Code by the second development. 
(i)  Refunds. Where a project has not commenced construction after issuance of a building permit, requests for refunds of parking space fees must be made in writing and will be considered on an individual basis and approved by the city council. After determination of the city council at a public meeting that the property owner is entitled to a refund, the city shall return the amount so determined. Any interest that may have been earned on such amounts shall not be refundable.

(2)  Horizontal surface. A horizontal plane, located 150 feet above the established airport elevation. The perimeter of the surface is constructed by swinging arcs with 10,000-foot radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of the airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
(3)  Conical surface. The area extending outward and upwards from the periphery of the horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The height of this surface is 150 feet above the airport height at the inner boundary with permitted height increasing one foot vertically for every 20 feet of horizontal distance measured outward from the inner boundary to a height of 358 feet above mean sea level (MSL) at the outer boundary. 
(4)  Approach surfaces. Areas longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerlines and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. The inner width equals the width of the respective primary surface. The outer width of the approach surface is prescribed for the most precise instrument approach procedure, existing or planned, for that runway end expanding uniformly. The outer width of the approach surface for Runway 5/23 is 4,000 feet and the outer width for Runway 14/32 is 3,500 feet. Permitted heights within these areas underlying approach surfaces shall not exceed the height of the respective runway end (six feet for the ends of Runway 5, 23 and 14, seven feet for the end of Runway 32) at the inner edge and increases at specific slopes, uniformly with the increase in horizontal distance away from the respective runway end along the extended runway centerline. The approach surface slope for Runway 5/23 is 34:1, meaning one foot vertically for every 34 feet horizontally for 10,000 feet. The approach surface slope for Runway 14/32 is 34:1 meaning one foot vertically for every 34 feet horizontally for 10,000 feet. 
(5)  Transitional surface. Transitional surfaces extend outward and upward at a slope of 7:1 at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended, at a slope of 7:1 from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces. 
(6)  Other areas. In addition to the height limitations imposed above, no obstruction will be permitted which exceeds the following: 
a.  A height of 500 feet above ground level (AGL) at the site of the object; 
b.  A height of 200 feet AGL or above the airport elevation within three miles of the airport reference point (Exhibit B on file in the office of the city clerk), and that height increases in the proportion of 100 feet for each additional nautical mile from the airport up to a maximum of 500 feet; 
c.  A height that would cause the minimum obstacle clearance altitude, minimum descent altitude, decision height or a minimum vectoring altitude to increase; or 
d.  A height of 350 feet AGL within the lateral confines of the airport's traffic pattern airspace. 
(b)  FAA and airport authority notice requirements. Each petitioner who proposes construction or alteration that exceeds an imaginary surface extending outward and upward at a slope of 100:1 for a horizontal distance of 20,000 feet from the nearest point of the nearest runway at the airport, or 200 feet AGL at proposed site, shall notify the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the form and manner prescribed in 14 CFR Part 77. All proposals that meet notification requirements contained in 14 CFR Part 77 shall be forwarded to the executive director of the NAA for review and comment. 
(c)  No structure, vegetation or terrain located within the lateral boundaries and exceeding the height limitations of the airport's imaginary surfaces, described in this section and shown in Exhibit A or Exhibit B, both on file in the office of the city clerk, may be constructed, erected, moved, repaired, allowed to grow, maintained, altered, or modified resulting in an increase in height, unless an application for an obstruction permit has been submitted to the city manager. No permit shall be issued unless the FAA has reviewed the proposed construction or alteration and issued a final and unexpired airspace determination of the proposal and evaluation in accordance with 14 CFR Part 77. Notice to the FAA via FAA Form 7460-1 (Exhibit C on file in the office of the city clerk) is also required for any temporary or permanent building or structure, including construction equipment, cranes, balloons, etc., the height of which exceeds the aforementioned criteria. 
(Code 1994, § 102-1034; Ord. No. 02-9648, § 2, 6-5-2002; Ord. No. 18-14162 , § 1, 6-6-2018) 
Sec. 58-1074. - Airport overlay district permitting, procedures and criteria for permit approval. 
(a)  Review of potential obstructions by executive director of airport authority. No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure or permit growth of any vegetation that is determined by the city manager to be a potential airport obstruction without first receiving comments from the executive director of the NAA. 
(b)  Exemptions from permitting regulations. Any proposed development that is determined by the FAA, through the issuance of a DNE (Does Not Exceed) determination issued in accordance with 14 CFR Part 77, not to be a potential airport obstruction is exempt from any airport overlay district permitting requirements contained herein. 
(c)  Granting of permits; appeals. Any applicant affected by the height notification criteria contained in section 58-1073 must apply to the city manager for an airspace obstruction permit. In accordance with the requirements of F.S. ch. 333, a permit may not be issued if it would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard, or if it would permit a nonconforming obstruction to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable airport protection zoning regulation was adopted which allowed the establishment or creation of the obstruction, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
(1)  Procedures for obtaining an airspace obstruction permit. 
a.  Applicants shall submit to the city manager a completed application form provided by the city manager, a copy of FAA Form 7460-1, notice of proposed construction or alteration, submitted for the project. The application must be submitted at least 90 days prior to the date an application for a construction permit is intended to be filed. A copy of the application form and supporting materials must be concurrently submitted to NAA staff for review and comment. The city manager may consider permit requests concurrent with development plan approval consideration. 
b.  In accordance with F.S. ch. 333, upon receipt of a complete permit application, the city must provide a copy of the application and supporting materials to the Florida Department of Transportation Aviation and Spaceports Office (FDOT ASO). To evaluate technical consistency with the requirements of F.S. ch. 333, the office shall have a 15-day review and comment period following receipt of the application, which will run concurrently with the local government permitting process. 
(2)  Criteria for granting an airspace obstruction permit proposal. 
a.  Where the FAA has reviewed a proposal and determined that the proposal would exceed the obstruction standards (determination of no hazard to air navigation) contained in 14 CFR Part 77, but would not have any substantial adverse effect on air navigation, the proposal must undergo further review by the city in coordination with the NAA staff and an airport obstruction permit will be required. 
b.  As part of the request for an airspace obstruction permit the applicant shall submit the following: 
1.  A copy of the notice of proposed construction form submitted to the FAA (FAA Form 7460-1); and 
2.  A valid final and unexpired airspace determination issued by the FAA based on its review of the applicant's Form 7460-1. 
c.  Where the FAA and the NAA staff have reviewed the proposal, and determined its construction would exceed any of the obstruction standards contained in 14 CFR Part 77, but will not result in a substantial adverse effect on air navigation, the city may grant an airspace obstruction permit for a proposal if it determines that a literal enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or an unnecessary hardship where the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest provided that: 
1.  A condition is attached to the permit to require that the approved structure is marked and lighted in accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular AC-70-7460-1, as may be amended. Where such marking or lighting is required, such requirement shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the affected structure; 
2.  As a part of the permitting review the following shall be considered: 
i.  The impact of the proposal on the safety of persons on the ground and in the air. 
ii.  The impact of the proposal on the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. 
iii.  The nature of the surrounding terrain and height of existing structures. 
iv.  The effect of the construction or alteration on the state licensing standards for a public use airport contained in F.S. ch. 330 and Administrative Code rules adopted thereunder. 
v.  The character of existing and planned flight operations and developments at the airport. 
vi.  Impacts by the proposal on federal airways, visual flight rules, airspace, flyways and corridors, and day and night instrument approaches and departure procedures, as established by the FAA. 
vii.  The effect of the construction or alteration of the proposed structure on the minimum descent altitudes or the decision heights at the affected airport. 
viii.  The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of the proposal and all existing structures and other known proposed structures in the area. 
ix.  Potential impact of the proposed development on existing noise abatement and noise mitigation measures. 
x.  FDOT comments and recommendations issued as a result of the agency review conducted in accordance with F.S. ch. 333. 
xi.  Comments and recommendations from NAA representatives. 
xii.  Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts, where applicable. 
d.  If the proposal is found to have no substantial adverse effect on existing or planned operations and development at the airport, the city manager may grant the permit for the proposal. The owner/operator of the obstruction shall be required to install, operate and maintain thereon in perpetuity and at his or her own expense, obstruction marking and lighting in conformance with the standards contained in the FAA AC 70/7460-1. 
e.  Where the FAA has reviewed the proposal and determined its construction or alteration would exceed obstruction standards contained in 14 CFR Part 77 and result in a hazard to air navigation (final determination of hazard), the city manager shall not grant the permit for the proposal. 
(3)  Appeals. Actions of the city manager relating to granting or denying a permit may be appealed within 15 days of the decision rendered. Appeals shall be filed with the city manager, heard by the city council, or by a board or special magistrate it may designate, and may be filed by the applicant, staff, any person specifically aggrieved, governing body of a political subdivision, NAA, or FDOT. All appeals shall be filed, reviewed, and heard within 90 days unless waived in a manner consistent with F.S. ch. 333. Council may establish a reasonable appeal fee.

Sec. 58-1075. - Airport land use compatibility regulations. 
(a)  Generally. Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, no use may be made of land or water within, on or under any zone, surface or area established by this AOD or within or under class D airspace or controlled airspace as defined by 14 CFR Part 77 in such a manner as to interfere with the operation of an airborne aircraft. The following special requirements shall apply to each permitted use within the city limits: 
(1)  All lights or illuminations used in conjunction with streets, parking, signs or use of land or structures shall be arranged and operated in such a manner that it is not misleading to pilots or dangerous to aircraft operating to and from the airport. 
(2)  All floodlights, spotlights/laser lights, or any type of pulsating, flashing, rotating or oscillating lights shall be modified or prohibited if determined to be a possible risk to safety or aircraft operations by the executive director of the NAA. 
(3)  No operations of any type shall produce smoke, glare, or other visual impairment to pilots within the city corporate limits. 
(4)  No operations of any type shall produce electronic interference with navigation signals or radio communication between the aircraft and the air traffic control facility. 
(5)  Land within the runway protection zones shall be prohibited from use for residential use, educational facilities, hospitals, storage of explosives or flammable material, assemblages of large groups of people or any other use that could produce a major catastrophe as a result of an aircraft crash. Any changes to use of land or increase in density or intensity of use is subject to additional coordination with and approval by FAA. The runway protection zones for each runway are depicted on Exhibit A (on file with the city). 
(6)  Any solid waste management facility (not including horticultural facilities) or any other significant bird attractor located so that it places the runways or approach and departure paths or patterns of an airport between bird feeding, water or roosting areas shall be considered an incompatible use and is therefore prohibited in and around the airport. Additionally, no new landfills shall be permitted within 10,000 feet from the nearest point of any runway at the airport. 
(7)  Any type of tethered dirigible, balloon, or other type of hovering or floating object the height of which exceeds the airspace notification limits outlined in section 58-1073 shall be limited to a height not to exceed the obstruction surface criteria listed in section 58-1073. 
(8)  No structure of any height, type or material shall be constructed or altered so as to cause interference with any radio or electronic navigational aids or systems as determined by the FAA, or by the executive director of the NAA. 
(9)  Launching of any type of object, such as powered rockets, fireworks, power parachutes, ultralights, unregulated aircraft, etc., from within the city limits into class D airspace is prohibited without the written authorization of the FAA and the executive director of the NAA. 
(b)  Nonconforming uses; regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure or natural vegetation not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, or to otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use except as provided in F.S. ch. 333. However, no pre-existing nonconforming structure, natural vegetation, or use shall be replaced, rebuilt, altered, or replanted so as to constitute an increase in the degree of nonconformity with these regulations, or in a manner not conforming with the regulations if the city determines that a nonconforming obstruction has been abandoned or is more than 80 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date and which has been issued a building permit which is diligently pursued. 
(c)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided herein, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone hereby created except in compliance with the requirements of this division. 
(d)  Existing uses. No building permit, or obstruction permit, shall be issued that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use or structure to be made, or become higher, or to become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the initial effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived. 
(e)  Appeals. Actions of the city manager relating to granting or denying a permit may be appealed within 15 days of the decision rendered and will be conducted in the same manner as in section 58-1074.

Sec. 58-1076. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 18-14162 , § 1, adopted June 6, 2018, deleted § 58-1076, entitled "School impact area regulations," which derived from: Code 1994, § 102-1037; and Ord. No. 02-9648, § 2, adopted June 5, 2002. 
Sec. 58-1077. - Airport noise impact zones established. 
    There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted city zoning atlas an "airport noise impact zone" as depicted on the Naples Airport Noise Contour Plan (Exhibit D on file in the office of the city clerk) for areas surrounding the airport. The airport noise impact zone is an area with restricted land uses and special construction standards to minimize the impact of noise produced by aircraft operations. The airport noise impact zone map contained herein is based on projected future aircraft operations and is defined as follows: 
(1)  Noise impact zone A. The entire interior area of the curvilinear figure delineated by the outermost boundary of line A on the noise zone map. The contour of noise zone A approximates the 75 Ldn line. 
(2)  Noise impact zone B. That area commencing at the boundary indicated on the noise zone map as the boundary of noise zone A and extending outward therefrom to the boundary indicated on the noise zone map as B. The contour of noise zone B approximates the 70 Ldn line. 
(3)  Noise impact zone C. That area commencing at the boundary indicated on the noise zone map as the outer boundary of noise zone B and extending outward therefrom to the boundary indicated on the noise zone map as C. The contour of noise zone C approximates the 65 Ldn line. 
(4)  Noise impact zone D. That area commencing at the boundary indicated on the noise zone map as the outer boundary of noise zone C and extending therefrom to the boundary indicated on the noise zone map as D. The contour of noise zone D approximates the 60 Ldn lines as further modified based upon property lines and zoning district boundaries. 
(Code 1994, § 102-1038; Ord. No. 02-9648, § 2, 6-5-2002; Ord. No. 18-14162 , § 1, 6-6-2018) 
Sec. 58-1078. - Airport noise impact zone land use regulations. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish standards for land use with respect to exterior noise resulting from the legal and normal operations at the airport within the city. Section 58-1077 establishes four specific noise zones of differing intensities. This section shall address specific land use in the vicinity of the airport, as identified in the most recent Naples Airport FAA Part 150 Study as it now exists or may be hereafter amended or established from time to time in accordance with federal regulations; establishes permitted and prohibited land uses in the noise zones; establishes the appeal process, establishes soundproofing requirements for development within the noise zones; and establishes notification procedures.

7.  Inbound approach or outbound departure flight paths relative to the extended runway centerline. 
8.  Proximity of the site to runways. 
_____
(b)  Appeals. Determinations made by the city manager, relating to use interpretations involving Table 1, may be appealed in the same manner as set out in section 58-1074. 
(c)  Permitted and restricted activities. Land uses shall be permitted in the noise zone pursuant to the applicable zoning district and as provided in Table 1. Those activities and land uses not specifically listed in the land use regulation chart are permitted or restricted in the noise zones based on their similarity to noise tolerance as exhibited by the activities and land uses which are listed in the regulation chart. 
(d)  Parcels in more than one zone. Where boundaries of more than one noise impact zone are shown on a parcel, provisions of the most restrictive zone shall apply. 
(e)  Parcels partly in impact zone. Where boundaries of an entire parcel noise impact zone traverse a portion of a parcel, only the land within the zone is subject to the regulations of this section. 
(f)  Nonconforming uses. The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be construed to require the sound conditioning or other changes or alteration of any preexisting structure not conforming to this section as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, or to otherwise interfere with the continuance of any such pre-existing nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any such change in the construction of or alteration of a structure which has commenced construction prior to such effective date and which is diligently pursued. 
(g)  Sound level requirement (SLR) for buildings or structures. The provisions of these special regulations shall apply to the construction of a new building and the major redevelopment of existing buildings: 
(1)  Redevelopment of an existing structure containing residential uses which triggers the need for compliance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's floor elevations will also require compliance with the sound level requirement of 45 Ldn. 
(2)  Buildings or structures moved into the established noise zone must comply with applicable provisions. 
(h)  Compliance with sound isolation performance standards. Compliance with the aircraft sound isolation performance standards shall be established by certification from a registered professional architect or engineer so that, when constructed in accordance with the approved plans and with quality workmanship, the building shall achieve the specified interior noise levels, or by the use of assemblies having the sound transmission class ratings. 
(i)  Notification of potential noise impact. 
(1)  Public notice of the existence of maps depicting noise impacted areas shall be published at least three times in a newspaper of general circulation in Collier County. 
(2)  The airport noise zones are identified on the city zoning map including any revisions or reconfigurations and shall be available for public inspection at the city offices. 
(3)  Upon any revision of the maps depicting potential noise impacted areas, the city manager shall record in the public records of the county a notice of potential noise impacted areas with maps depicting the noise contours shown thereon. Said notice shall provide constructive notice to existing and prospective purchasers of property within the noise impacted area and elsewhere. 
(j)  Avigation easements. New development or redevelopment of property located within the land use zones described in Table 1 of this section shall be evaluated to determine the appropriateness of requiring an avigation easement, or its functional equivalent, in favor of the NAA. Such evaluation shall be based upon the criteria for evaluating conditional uses outlined in Table 1 of this section. Any avigation easement, or its functional equivalent, shall have an essential nexus to a legitimate public purpose and be roughly proportionate to the impacts of the proposed development or redevelopment. 
(k)  Disclosure statement. Any person (entity) in a first sale from the developer selling any interest in real property located within the noise impact zone shall disclose in writing in the sales contract or addendum the following information to the purchaser prior to the sale: 
(1)  The noise impact zone within which the real property lies; and 
(2)  A statement that the real property lies within an area where airport noise may be present and objectionable. 
Said written notice shall also contain a statement substantially as follows: "The undersigned purchaser of said interest in real property hereby certifies that the purchaser has read and understands the above disclosure made by the seller and acknowledges the pre-existence of the airport and the potential for objectionable noise affecting the use and enjoyment of the real property." 
Although the disclosures required by this paragraph (k) shall not apply to resales of improved real property existing as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived, it shall not operate to obviate any disclosures regarding the existence of the airport or the effect of the airport noise zone on the property that may otherwise exist at law or in equity. 
(l)  Developer requirements prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for new development or redevelopment located within the noise impact zones, the developer shall provide deed restrictions or a declaration of condominium stating that the property is located in an airport noise impact zone.
