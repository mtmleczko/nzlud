PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Hawkinsville, Georgia, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented through November 27, 1973, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of John Drombroski, Vice President for production, and Elizabeth Butler, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Evelyn Herrington, City Clerk, and city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-111. - Declaration of policy. 
(a)	Those who are elected to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire, or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. The public entrusts its power and resources to its servants to use only in the public interest. Public trust requires public servants to fulfill their public duties faithfully and honestly, and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair. 
(b)	It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government. Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.

(4)	To encourage public servants to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve;
(5)	To provide a process by which public service may identify and resolve ethical issues;
(6)	To inform public servants and the public of the minimum standards to which public servants must adhere; 
(7)	To promote public confidence in the integrity of public servants;
(8)	To encourage members of the public to seek public office or employment, to serve on public boards, to assist public servants as volunteers, and to take pride in participating in the governmental process; 
(9)	To establish penalties, as appropriate, for public servants who violate the public trust; and 
(10)	To provide for a just and reasonable balance among the rights of all individuals who are directly affected by the operation of this article.

The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. 43-39A-l et seq., qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
(3)	If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within two hundred seventy (270) days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or section 5-28 of this article, or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the two hundred seventy (270) days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(4)	If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
(5)	The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(b)	(1)	The lien provided for in paragraph (5) above shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c) and subsection 5-26(c) of this article. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
(2)	Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within ninety (90) days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property as valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; provided however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to the article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county or municipality whose lien is being collected. 
(3)	Enforcment of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
(4)	The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this article together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
(c)	The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(d)	Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(e)	In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
(f)	Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings.

Sec. 9-26. - Permit required. 
    It shall be unlawful and a violation of the laws and ordinances of this city for any person to dig or cause to be dug any well within the corporate limits of the city until a written application for a permit for such well has been passed on and approved by the board of commissioners. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-27. - Permit application. 
(a)	Any person desiring to dig or cause to be dug a well within the corporate limits of the city shall first apply in writing to the board of commissioners of such proposal to dig a well and set forth in such application information concerning the location of the proposed well, anticipated depth of the proposed well and the uses to be made of the same. The application shall set forth the name of the person who shall dig or bore the well with the proposed method to be used in digging. Details, including the size and depth of such boring, shall be specified in the application. 
(b)	The application filed with the city clerk shall be signed by the person on whose property the well is to be dug and by the person or representative of the firm which proposes to bore or dig the well, affirming those statements made in the application to be true. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-28. - Hearing. 
    Upon the filing of an application for a permit under this article, the applicant shall be notified of the time and place of a hearing to be held by the board of commissioners on the application as to whether or not permission will be granted for such digging. The applicant may appear before the board of commissioners on the question of whether the permit should be granted and present evidence and argument in his own behalf. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-29. - Recording, notice of board action on applications. 
    The board of commissioners shall consider the application for a permit under this article and all the facts and circumstances and either grant the permit or deny the application for the permit. In either event, the action of the board of commissioners shall be recorded and the city clerk shall notify the applicant of the action taken by the board on the application. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-30. - General guideline principles. 
    The board of commissioners, in passing upon applications for permits to dig wells, repair the same, install pumps or abandon wells, shall be guided by the standards as set forth herein. In passing on such applications, the board shall be guided by the duty to protect the health and sanitation of the citizens of the city and should take into account that hazards usually increase where the water table is at a comparatively shallow depth, particularly in populous areas. Sewer lines, septic tanks, leaching fields, fertilizers, industrial wastes, pesticides and other chemicals, cesspools, outdoor toilets and other like conditions are potential sources of contaminants and pollutants. Improperly constructed wells and abandoned wells can be avenues for carrying contaminants to the aquifer. If the top of the well is not properly protected, surface contaminants can enter the well and the groundwater. Similarly, if the space between the wall of the drill holes and the casing is not sealed in the upper part of the well and if this space is not protected from pollution down to the water table, then the space surrounding the casing can act as a conduit for carrying pollutants to the aquifer. These general principles shall be standards or guidelines in applying the more particular standards as set forth herein and in passing on whether or not permission shall be granted or denied on any application referred to herein. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-31. - Factors of consideration generally. 
(a)	The board of commissioners shall grant or deny the well permit after considering:
(1)	The location of the proposed well and its effect on the water supply in the immediate area of the proposed well and underground waters nearby, as well as the general supply of water lying underground in and about the city. 
(2)	The general porosity of the soil in the area in which the well is proposed to be dug, taking into account the septic tanks in the general vicinity which will affect the water supply in and about the area where the well is proposed to be bored. Drain lines from such septic tanks as may be in the area and other factors affecting the surface water and seepage shall be considered in this respect. 
(3)	The proposed method of construction as outlined by the applicant shall be considered, taking into account protective measures proposed to be used to prevent pollution of underground waters and any underground source of waters which the proposed well may tap. 
(4)	Any other factor which may bear upon the water supply of the city and the sources of the supply, including the density of population in and about the area in which permission is sought to dig the well. 
(b)	The board shall not arbitrarily deny a permit for the digging of a well. In all applications an opportunity shall be given for hearing before the board of commissioners by the applicant in support of his application. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-32. - Determining factors, standards. 
    The board of commissioners shall grant or deny the permit under this article after considering the factors hereinafter set forth which shall be determining factors or standards in granting or denying the permit: 
(1)	The geological formations and structures underlying the area in which the well is proposed to be dug must be suitable for the purpose; 
(2)	Hydrology and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifers;
(3)	Density of population;
(4)	Estimated demands for water;
(5)	Depth to the groundwater table;
(6)	Character of subsoil formation;
(7)	Quality of groundwater;

h.	Screen information: length, trade name, inside and outside diameter, slot size, type of material; 
i.	Static water level;
j.	Water level when pumped at the designed rate;
k.	Yield of well in gallons per minute or hour.
(2)	Requirements for drilling:
a.	The city shall be assured that the well will be constructed and dug in an area which can be kept in a sanitary condition. 
b.	It shall be constructed in such a manner as to maintain insofar as practicable existing natural protection against pollution of water-bearing formations and to exclude pollutants from known sources. 
c.	The construction of the well should seal off, insofar as practicable, water-bearing formations that are or may be polluted. 
d.	The well shall be constructed so that no unsealed opening will be left around the well. 
e.	The city shall be assured that the well is located so that it is protected from surface waters and from seepage from sources of contamination and pollution.

Such application shall be submitted in the same manner as an application to dig a well as set forth herein, and the applicant shall have notice and opportunity to be heard as to whether permission will be granted for such repairs to be made. In passing on such an application for repairs, the standards to guide the board in granting or denying such permit are: 
(1)	The proposed method of repairs as outlined by the applicant shall be taken into consideration, including but not limited to the protective measures proposed to be used to prevent pollution of underground waters and any underground source of water which this well taps, together with any other factor which may bear upon the water supply of the city and the sources of such supply. 
(2)	In any repairs or alterations to an existing well, the same shall be disinfected with a chlorine solution. 
(3)	After repairs, a water sample must be collected and analyzed for bacterial acceptance.
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-35. - Pump installations. 
    Before any pump is installed, either in a new well or in the repairs of an existing well, the top of the well must be completed in a way that will insure the protection of the groundwaters from surface contamination. This completion includes providing proper drainage away from the well, sealing the space between the walls and the drill hole and the well casing and closing the space between the pump, pipe and the casing. Installing a new pump shall be considered as a repair and all the rules governing repairs or alterations of a well shall apply should a pump be installed for any purpose. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-36. - Abandonment of wells. 
    Wells which will no longer be used as a water supply shall be plugged to prevent entrance of surface water, filth or any other substances which might pollute or contaminate the groundwater. The casing may be withdrawn and the well filled with chlorinated sand to a distance of five (5) feet above the static water level. The balance of the distance to the ground surface shall be filled with clean earth, firmly tapped. If the casing is not removed, it shall be cut away below the ground surface and the filling procedure as set forth herein shall be carried out. Any test holes that may be dug shall be plugged in a manner that does not allow the entrance of surface water or any other material that might pollute or contaminate the groundwater. Plugging procedures may vary to suit the geological condition at the test hole site. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-37. - Disposal wells. 
    Under no circumstances shall a well of any type be drilled, dug or excavated, nor shall any existing well be used for the purpose of receiving sewage, liquid or solid waste, rubbish, garbage or any other waste material. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)
Sec. 9-38. - Connection to present city water mains prohibited. 
    No person given permission to dig a well shall be permitted to attach to or remain attached to any existing city water main or line held or operated by the city. Under no conditions may any private well permitted under the procedures as outlined in this article be connected or joined with the public water supply of the city. 
(Ord. of 10-21-75)

(2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsection] c.(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(c). 
c.	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible; provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)	Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 5.2.3.b.2. of this ordinance; 
(15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and, for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
(a)	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
(b)	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)	Stream crossings for water lines; or
(ii)	Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)	There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5, of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
(a)	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
(b)	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)	Stream crossings for water lines; or
(ii)	Stream crossings for sewer lines.
d.	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 5.2.3.b. and c. of this ordinance. 
e.	The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2010-2, 5-3-10)
Sec. 5.2.4. - Application/permit process. 
a.	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
b.	Application requirements. 
(1)	No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Hawkinsville without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority (Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsviile Building Department) to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsviile Building Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 5.2.4.c., of this ordinance. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 5.2.3.b. and c., of this ordinance will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two (2) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)	A fee in the amount of twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be charged for each application. In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 5.2.3.c.(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 5.2.4.b.(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)	If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
c.	Plan requirements. 
(1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 5.2.3.b. and c. of this ordinance, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
(2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
d.	Permits. 
(1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by subsections 5.2.3.c.(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 5.2.4.b.(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)	Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 2010-2, 5-3-10)
Sec. 5.2.5. - Inspection and enforcement. 
a.	The Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsville Building Department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance. 
b.	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
c.	The Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsville Building Department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
d.	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
e.	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
f.	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Ord. No. 2010-2, 5-3-10)
Sec. 5.2.6. - Penalties and incentives. 
a.	Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this ordinance without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
b.	Stop work orders. 
(1)	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this ordinance, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
(3)	All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
c.	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 5.2.4.b.(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
d.	Monetary penalties. 
(1)	Any person who violates any provisions of this ordinance, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this ordinance, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this ordinance shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this ordinance, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this ordinance under county ordinances approved under this ordinance shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

Sec. 5.2.7. - Education and certification. 
a.	Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
b.	For each site on which land disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one (1) person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
c.	Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this ordinance. 
d.	If a state general permittee who has operational control of land disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph. 
(Ord. No. 2010-2, 5-3-10)
Sec. 5.2.8. - Administrative appeal and judicial review. 
a.	Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the Hawkinsville City Commission within ten (10) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal.

DIVISION 3. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Sec. 5.3.1. - Findings of fact. 
a.	The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
b.	These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. 
(Ord. of 5-10-96)
Sec. 5.3.2. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
a.	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
b.	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
c.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
d.	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
e.	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. of 5-10-96)
Sec. 5.3.3. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this division are to: 
a.	Protect human life and health;
b.	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
c.	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
d.	Minimize prolonged business interruption;
e.	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
f.	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
g.	Insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

b.	Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study: The official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Floor: The top surface of an enclosed area in a building including basement, i.e., top of slab in concrete shall construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of garage used solely for parking vehicles. 
    Functionally dependent facility: A facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as docking or port facility necessary for the loading an unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term "functionally dependent facility" does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Mean sea level: The average height of the sea for a stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this section, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD): As corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction: Any structure for which the start of construction commenced after the effective date of the original ordinance from which this section derives. 
    Start of construction: For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-3-18), includes substantial improvements, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a building, including a manufactured home, on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; the excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; or the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. 
    Substantial improvement: Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during the life of a building, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the building. The market value of the building should be: 
a.	The appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
b.	In the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring.
For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.

DIVISION 7. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note-Ord. No. 99-2, adopted March, 22, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code, hence; inclusion as §§ 5.7.1-5.7.5 was at the editor's discretion.

Sec. 5.7.1. - Short title, background and objectives. 
(a)	This division shall be known as the "Groundwater Protection Ordinance."
(b)	Background. Variable levels of recharge area protection can be based upon the State's hydrogeology (e.g., areas such as the Dougherty Plain where a major aquifer crops out would receive a relatively high degree of protection whereas other areas, such as the shale hills of northwest Georgia, would receive a lower degree of protection). Recharge area protection within the significant recharge areas would be further refined, based upon the local susceptibility or vulnerability to human induced pollution (e.g., high, medium, or low). The significant recharge areas have already been identified and mapped (about 22-23% of the State). Pollution susceptibility mapping is ongoing. Existing statutes are adequate for protecting the remaining recharge areas (about 77-78% of the State). 
(c)	Objectives. The objectives of this division are:
(1)	Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
(2)	Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)	Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
(Ord. No. 99-2, § 1, 3-22-99)
Sec. 5.7.2. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district. 
    A Groundwater Recharge Area District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Hawkinsville, Georgia that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. 
(Ord. No. 99-2, § 2, 3-22-99)
Sec. 5.7.3. - Determination of pollution susceptibility. 
    Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
(Ord. No. 99-2, § 3, 3-22-99)
Sec. 5.7.4. - Definitions. 
    When used in this division, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section: 
    "Aquifer" means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. (Note: This is the same definition used in the Groundwater Use Act). 
    "Drastic" means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U. S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The "DRASTIC" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
    "Pollution Susceptibility" means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharge, leaks, impoundment's, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
    "Pollution Susceptibility Maps" means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the State into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
    "Recharge Area" means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
    "Significant Recharge Areas" means those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. 
(Ord. No. 99-2, § 4, 3-22-99)
Sec. 5.7.5. - Criteria in significant recharge areas. 
    The following criteria pursuant to § O.C.G.A. § 12-2-18 shall apply in significant recharge areas: 
(a)	The Department of Natural Resources shall not issue any permits for new sanitary landfills not having synthetic liners and leachate collection systems. 
(b)	The Department of Natural Resources shall not issue any new permits for the land disposal of hazardous wastes.

DIVISION 8. - HAWKINSVILLE RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note-Ord. No. 99-3, adopted March 22, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code, hence; inclusion as §§ 5.8.1-5.8.6 was at the editor's discretion.
State Law reference- Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.

Sec. 5.8.1. - Purpose. 
(a)	The River Corridor Protection District is an overlay district that applies additional standards of specific areas that may lie within any State of Georgia designated protected river corridor. In each zoning district located within the boundaries of the River Corridor Protection District, both the regulations of that district and the regulations of the River Corridor Protection District apply. If required development standards are specified for the same item in both districts, the more stringent governs. 
(b)	The purpose of this district is to protect certain river corridors that have been designated by the State of Georgia as Protected River Corridors because of their unique environmental importance. This district is intended to help maintain high water quality of these rivers. Other counties lying along these river corridors have adopted similar protective measures. In this manner, this State resource may be protected in a way that would not be possible by the uncoordinated action of an individual jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 99-3, § 1, 3-22-99)
Sec. 5.8.2. - Definitions. 
    Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations, promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
    Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
    Land uses existing prior to the promulgation of a River Corridor Protection Plan means any land use or land disturbing activity, including all human endeavors directly associated with such use or activity, which, prior to the promulgation of the River Corridor Protection Plan falls within one of the following categories: 
1.	Is completed;
2.	Is under construction;
3.	Is fully approved by the governing authority;
4.	All materials have been submitted for approval by the governing authority; or
5.	Is zoned for such use and expenditures in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) have been made in preparation for construction in accordance with such zoning. 
    Local government means the governing authority of a political subdivision. 
    Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, The Natural Environments of Georgia. Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
    Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
    Plan or comprehensive plan means any plan by a county or municipality covering such county or municipality or any plan by a regional development center covering the center's region proposed or prepared pursuant to the minimum planning standards and procedures for preparation of comprehensive plans and for implementation of comprehensive plans, established by the Department of Community Affairs in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-1 through 50-8-12. (Note this is the same definition as used in O.C.G.A. § 50-8-2) 
    Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least four hundred (400) cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. 
    Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services, and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
    Quadrangle map means the most recently published U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic map prepared at a scale of 1:24,000. 
    River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
    River corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within one hundred (100) feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The one hundred (100) foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured one hundred (100) foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the River Corridor Protection Plan. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the Department of Community Affairs. 
    River Corridor Protection Plan means that part of the local comprehensive plan which deals with the river corridor protection requirements specified herein.

Sec. 6.2.4. - Standards for zoning changes. 
a.	Zoning Map Amendments (Rezoning). The Planning Commission and the Board of Commissioners shall consider the following standards in considering any zoning proposal that would result in a change in the boundary of a zoning district, giving due weight or priority to those factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of each proposal: 
(1)	Whether the proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the zoning and development of adjacent and nearby property. 
(2)	Whether the proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. 
(3)	Whether the proposal is compatible with the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(4)	Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently zoned. 
(5)	Whether the proposal will result in a use that will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including but not limited to streets, schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection. 
(6)	Whether the proposal is supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan or reflected in the existing zoning on the property or surrounding properties. 
(7)	Whether the proposal reflects a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of property. 
b.	Conditional Uses. A conditional use otherwise permitted within a zoning district shall be considered to be compatible with other uses permitted in the district, provided that due consideration is given to the following objective criteria as applicable to the specific use proposed: 
(1)	The type of street providing access to the use is or will be adequate to serve the proposed Conditional Use. 
(2)	Access into and out of the property is or will be adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and access by emergency vehicles. 
(3)	Refuse, service, parking, and loading areas on the property are or will be located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light, glare, or odor. 
(4)	The hours and manner of operation of the Condition Use has or will have no adverse effects on other properties in the area. 
(5)	The height, size, or location of the buildings or other structures on the property are or will be compatible with the height, size, or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties. 
c.	Change in Conditions of Approval. Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously established by the Board of Commissioners through action on a zoning change shall be reviewed in light of the standards set forth in this Section for a map amendment or conditional use, as appropriate. 
(Ord. of 5-10-96)
Sec. 6.2.5. - Withdrawal. 
    Any applicant wishing to withdraw a proposed zoning change prior to final action by the Board of Commissioners shall file a written request for withdrawal with the City Manager.

b.	If notice has been published (or is irretrievably set for publication) but the application has not been heard by the Board of Commissioners, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the City Manager, and an application for a zoning change on the property may not be resubmitted for six (6) months from the date of withdrawal. In addition, the City Manager shall mail written notice of the withdrawal to the property owners previously notified. The cost of mailing shall be borne by the applicant. 
c.	Should any request for withdrawal be made by the applicant at the Board Of Commissioners' meeting, the application shall remain on the public hearing agenda and the withdrawal request shall be considered for approval or denial, with or without prejudice, by the Board of Commissioners.
