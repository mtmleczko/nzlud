PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Iola, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1988 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODECD1:1CODE APPENDIXCDA:1CODE COMPARATIVE TABLESCCT:1STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLESLT:1CODE INDEXCDi:1 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Weldon Padgett, City Administrator, Mr. Charles Apt, III, City Attorney, and Ms. Beth Ann Turner, Executive Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(a)	The catchlines of the several sections of this Code, printed in boldface type, are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of such sections, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. 
(b)	The history or source notes appearing in parentheses after sections in this Code are not intended to have any legal effect but are merely intended to indicate the source of matter contained in the section. Cross references and state law references which appear after sections or subsections of this Code or which otherwise appear in footnote form are provided for the convenience of the user of this Code and have no legal effect.

The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code by the governing body. 
(b)	Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "Section ____________ of Iola City Code is hereby amended to read as follows:...."

(a)	By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the governing body. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)	In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)	When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)	Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
(2)	Provide appropriate catchlines, headings, and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement and make changes in such catchlines, headings, and titles; 
(3)	Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)	Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Same-Exclusion of special or temporary ordinances. 
    Ordinances hereafter adopted which are not of a general or permanent nature shall be numbered consecutively, authenticated, published, and recorded in the book of ordinances, but such ordinances shall not be prepared for insertion in this Code, nor be deemed a part hereof.

(3)	Large industrial purchase option: Available to any City of Iola industrial customer consuming over 50,000 Mcf in a calendar year. The qualifying industrial customer can request a fixed price to lock in a portion of their annual gas consumption for a 12-month term. The city will determine the fixed price and the industrial customer can decide the volume they would like to secure for the 12-month term. The gas volume will be the same quantity of gas each month for the term. The amount will be in the range of 80 percent of the customer's lowest monthly consumption in a calendar year, but it will be up to the customer to decide since they're locking in a particular volume for the term. The industrial customer will be responsible for all associated costs with losses and their percentage share of the transportation cost for the nominated volume of gas the customer secures. The industrial customer will purchase any additional monthly gas volume under the city's current gas service rate (subsection 34-784(2)) and gas stop loss adjustment (section 94-257). If the industrial customer does not consume the fixed monthly volume, the customer is still responsible for the entire fixed price quantity and the corresponding expenses associated with transportation. The industrial customer will also be responsible for the local distribution charges associated with the monthly volume.

(4)	Any waters or wastes containing heavy metals exerting an excessive chlorine requirement, to such a degree that any such material received in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established by the city administrator for such materials, or pretreatment requirements established by state, federal or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge. 
(5)	Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the city administrator, as necessary, after treatment of the composite wastewater, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other public agencies jurisdiction for such discharge. 
(6)	Any waters or wastes containing dissolved sulfide in excess of five mg/l at the point of discharge into the municipal sewer system. 
(7)	Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to fuller's earth, lime slurries and live residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate). 
(8)	Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(9)	Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
(f)	If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sanitary sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (e) of this section, and which in the judgment of the city administrator, may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or would otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city administrator may: 
(1)	Reject the wastes;
(2)	Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sanitary sewers; 
(3)	Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

Such notifications must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed discharges must be submitted. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of this article. 
(b)	Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)	In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)	In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

a.	Elongated sites with rectangular, double-loaded building footprints should be avoided. These designs typically lack interest and fail to create a strong sense of neighborhood. 
b.	The architectural design of each unit or building should impart a feeling of neighborhood scale. Units should be designed with vertical and horizontal offsets to break up roof lines, define private outdoor areas, allow greater views and admit light and air to unit interiors. Large, blank wall surfaces should be avoided. Windows and projecting wall surfaces should be used to break up larger wall surfaces and establish visual interest 
c.	The same level of architectural design and quality of materials should be applied to all sides of the building. The side and rear elevations, garages, carports and all accessory structures should maintain the same level of design, aesthetic quality and architectural compatibility. 
d.	Screening from the street of all outdoor refuse areas, ground mounted mechanical equipment, utilities and banks of meters shall be provided. The screening of these items is to be architecturally compatible with major building components and should include landscaping.

Sec. 106-95. - Driveways and roadway access. 
    The following standards shall apply to all driveways providing access to multi-family or nonresidential uses. 
A.	General standards. 
1.	Off-street parking spaces shall be arranged so that no vehicle will back directly onto a street. All private parking areas and circulation drives shall be located off of the street right-of-way. 
2.	Access to property shall be allowed only by way of driveways, and no other portion of the lot frontage shall be used for ingress or egress. 
3.	Any driveway design must allow an entering vehicle turning speed of 15 miles per hour to help reduce interference with through street traffic. Radii of driveway shall be sufficient to achieve this standard for the types of vehicles that the driveway is intended to serve. 
4.	There must be sufficient on-site vehicle storage to accommodate queued vehicles waiting to park or exit, without interfering with street traffic. 
5.	Provisions for circulations between adjacent parcels should be provided through coordinated or joint parking systems. 
6.	Driveway placement should be such that loading and unloading activities will in no way hinder vehicle ingress or egress. 
7.	Driveway design must be such that vehicles entering the driveway from the street will not encroach upon the exit lane of a two-way driveway. Also, a right-turning exiting vehicle will be able to use only the first through-traffic lane available without encroaching into the adjacent through-lane. 
B.	Right turn lanes and tapers. Right turn lanes and taper shall be required when: 
1.	Expected right-turn ingress movements meet or exceed 50 vehicles per hour during a typical weekday peak traffic period. 
2.	Driveway volumes are expected to meet or exceed 1,000 vehicles per day calculated using the Institute of Transportation Engineers site generated traffic standards for closest matching land use category as set forth in the most recent edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. 
3.	The planning director can document through traffic analysis that such treatment is necessary to avoid congestion and/or unsafe conditions on the public arterial. 
C.	Driveway grade. The grade of a two-way, one-way or divided driveway shall not exceed two percent for a minimum distance of 25 feet from the edge of the pavement. 
D.	Sight distance. Direct-access driveways shall be located to allow the following minimum sight distance: 
Design Speed of Street (MPH)Minimum Sight Distance (Feet)30 20035225402754532550350 
E.	Driveway spacing. 
1.	Arterial streets. Direct access to an arterial street shall be permitted only when the subject property has no other reasonable access to the street system and only if the city commission with the recommendation of the planning director determines that the proposed access point onto the arterial street can be accommodated safely. When direct access to an arterial street is approved, the following standards shall apply. 
a.	Spacing from signalized intersections. All driveways providing access to arterial streets shall be constructed so that the point of tangency of the curb return radius closest to a signalized or stop sign-controlled intersection is at least 250 feet from the perpendicular curb face of the intersecting street. In the event that this standard cannot be met because of an unusually narrow or shallow lot size, the city commission with the recommendation of the planning director may reduce the spacing so long as the reduction does not result in an unsafe traffic condition. 
b.	Spacing from other (nonsignalized) access points. All driveways providing access to Arterial streets shall be constructed so that the point of tangency of the curb return radius closest to all nonsignalized street or driveway intersections is at least 200 feet from the perpendicular curb face of the intersecting street or driveway. In the event that this standard cannot be met because of an unusually narrow or shallow lot size, the city commission may reduce the spacing so long as the reduction does not result in an unsafe traffic condition. 
2.	Waivers. Waivers for these access standards may be approved by the city commission with the recommendation of the planning director if he determines that the requested waiver will not create a serious detriment to the safety or operation of traffic on the street or roadway. The city commission with the recommendation of the planning director may require that the applicant for a waiver submit a traffic analysis if it is determined that such an analysis is necessary in order to render a competent decision on the requested waiver. 
F.	Driveways per lot. 
1.	Unless otherwise specifically restricted, one driveway opening shall be allowed per 200 feet of continuous street frontage. At least one driveway shall be permitted for any one lot. 
2.	Lots with 200 feet of frontage or less may apply for a secondary driveway if shared with an adjoining lot, provided that the required minimum spacing is maintained. In such cases, only one shared driveway will be permitted. 
G.	Driveway width. Except for dual driveways approved by the city commission, the width of the driveway throat shall not exceed 35 feet. 
H.	Right-of-way work permit. No construction, grading, excavation, repair or reconstruction of any street, curb or gutter; or any sidewalk or driveway between the street and property line shall be commenced without first obtaining a right-of-way work permit from the planning director. 
Sec. 106-96. - Zoning district property development standards and measurements and computations. 
    The zoning district standards of article V establish many property development standards that apply within individual zoning districts. The rules governing exemptions, computations and measurements related to zoning district property development standards are established in this section. 
A.	Summary of residential property development standards. The following residential property development standards table provides a summary of the property development standards that apply within residential zoning districts. In the event of conflict between the standards of this table and the standards listed within the text of article V, the standards listed in article V shall control.

B.	Summary of nonresidential property development standards. The following nonresidential property development standards table provides a summary of the property development standards that apply within residential zoning districts. In the event of conflict between the standards of this table and the standards listed within the text of article V, the standards listed in article V shall control. 
Nonresidential Property Development StandardsDevelopment StandardsC-0C-1C-2IMinimum Lot Size (square feet)6,000NoneNone10,000Minimum Lot Width (feet)50NoneNone100Minimum Front Setback (feet)2502525Minimum Side Setback (feet)5-151 05-151 15Minimum Rear Setback (feet)2002020Maximum Building Coverage (% of lot area)651007585Maximum Height (feet)45454545-752  
Notes: 
1  The minimum side setback shall be 15 feet if abutting a residentially zoned property. 
2  The maximum height may be increased to 75 feet if the structure is more than 150 feet from a residential district. 
C.	Lot size. 
1.	Reduction of public purpose. When an existing lot is reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least 75 percent of the required minimum lot size for the district that it is located, then that remaining lot shall be deemed to comply with the minimum lot size standards of this Unified Development Code. 
2.	Utilities. Utilities (major or minor) using land or an unoccupied building requiring less than 1,000 square feet of site area are exempt from the minimum lot size standards of all zoning districts. 
3.	Single-family dwelling exemptions. The minimum lot size standards of this Unified Development Code shall not be interpreted as prohibiting the construction of a single-family dwelling unit, in accordance with all other applicable regulations, on a lot that was legally platted or recorded before the adoption of this Unified Development Code. 
D.	Residential densities. The zoning district regulations of this Unified Development Code express maximum residential densities in terms of lot area requirements per dwelling unit. The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a lot shall be determined by dividing the subject lot's total lot area by the applicable lot area (per dwelling unit) requirement of the district. The number of dwelling units permitted in a mixed-use building (one containing residential and nonresidential uses) shall not be affected by virtue of the building's mixed-use status. As with non-mixed-use projects, the maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall be calculated by dividing the subject lot's total lot area by the applicable lot area requirement of the district. 
E.	Setbacks. 
1.	Features allowed within setbacks. The following features may be located within setbacks: 
a.	Trees, shrubbery or other landscape features;
b.	Fences and walls, subject to section 106-87, Accessory use and structure development and operational standards; 
c.	Driveways and sidewalks;
d.	Signs, where permitted;
e.	Steps to the principal entrance, walks and balustrades;
f.	Bay windows, architectural features, cantilevered floors, chimneys and other ornamental features of buildings that do not project more than two feet into the required setbacks; 
g.	Fire escapes that do not extend into a setback by more than 30 percent of the required setback dimension; and, 
h.	Utility lines, wires and associated structures, such a power poles.
2.	Side or rear setback exemptions in I Industrial Districts. No side or rear setback shall be required for a lot within an I Industrial District if the lot adjoins a railway right-of-way or has a rear railway track connection, provided that sufficient access for firefighting equipment is available. Such access shall be approved by the fire chief before issuance of any permit. 
3.	Setback averaging. If the existing front setbacks of lots within the same block, with the same zoning classification and fronting on the same side of the street are less than the required front setback of the underlying zoning district, applicants shall be allowed to use the "average" front setback on that block. In such cases, the "average setback" shall be the mean (average) setback of all lots on the same side of the street within the same block as the subject property. In no event shall lots with different zoning classifications or undeveloped lots be included in the calculation. This provision shall not be interpreted as requiring a greater front setback than imposed by the underlying zoning district, and it shall not be interpreted as allowing setbacks to be reduced to a level that results in right-of way widths dropping below established minimums. 
4.	Setback reduced for public purpose. When an existing setback is reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining setback is at least 75 percent of the required minimum setback for the district that it is locate, then that remaining setback shall be deemed to satisfy the minimum setback standards of this Unified Development Code. 
F.	Height. 
1.	Fences or walls. In the case of fences or walls, height shall be measured on the side with the least vertical exposure above finished grade to the top of the fence or wall. 
2.	Exemptions from height standards. The following structures and features shall be exempt from the height requirements of this Unified Development Code: 
a.	Chimneys, smokestacks or flues;
b.	Cooling towers and ventilators;
c.	Elevators bulkheads and stairway enclosures;
d.	Grain elevators and silos;
e.	Flagpoles, radio and television receiving antennas and support structures, provided that they shall not exceed 150 percent of the maximum height permitted within the zoning district that they are located, measured from average finished grade at the base of the support structure or building that it is located; 
f.	Communication towers;
g.	Utility poles, water towers and support structures;
h.	Belfries, spires and steeples; and,
i.	Monuments and ornamental towers.
Sec. 106-97. - Landscaping and screening.

2.	All landscaping and screening plans shall be reviewed in terms of adequacy and suitability to the site and be approved by the city commission in conjunction with a site plan. 
Sec. 106-98. - Operational performance standards. 
A.	General. No parcel, lot, building, or structure in any zoning district shall be used or occupied in a manner so as to create any dangerous, harmful, noxious, or otherwise objectionable element or condition so as to adversely affect the surrounding area or adjoining premises, provided that any use that is allowed by the underlying zoning district regulations, may be undertaken and maintained if acceptable measures and safeguards are employed to limit dangerous and objectionable elements to acceptable limits as established by the following performance standards. 
B.	Fire hazards. Any activity regulated by the National Fire Protection Association and any other city, state or federal fire regulation shall be protected by adequate firefighting and fire suppression equipment and by such safety devices as are normally used in the handling of any such material. Such fire hazards shall be kept removed from adjacent activities to a distance that is compatible with the potential danger involved. 
C.	Vibration. No vibration shall be permitted that is detectable without instruments on any adjoining lot or property.

ARTICLE X. - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 

Sec. 106-131. - Purpose. 
    The requirements and recommendations set forth herein are designed to encourage orderly growth for the City of Iola through responsible land subdivision. Responsible land subdivision is the initial step in the process of orderly community development. Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is difficult and costly. 
    The purpose of this document is to set forth rules and regulations for the division of real property so that each subdivision shall be properly coordinated with existing streets, utilities and public facilities, and for the future development of these entities. These subdivision regulations will be helpful to city officials and private developers by clarifying requirements and by assuring more uniform application of city standards for new subdivisions. For plat application requirements see article IV, sections 106-45 through 106-48. 
Sec. 106-132. - Applicability. 
    The requirements of these subdivision regulations shall apply to any owner desiring to: 
A.	Divide or further divide land; or,
B.	Otherwise alter the boundaries of lots or parcels of land; or,
C.	Dedicate land for use as streets, alleys, and sidewalks or for other public or private purposes. 
Sec. 106-133. - Exemptions. 
    The following instances or transactions shall be exempt from the provisions of this article. 
A.	The division or further division of land into lots or parcels, each of which contains more than 40 acres, where such subdivision does not involve the creation of any new streets or easements of access. 
B.	A transaction between owners of adjoining land that involves only a change in the boundary between the land owned by such persons and does not create an additional lot or non-conformity. 
C.	A conveyance of land or interest therein for use as right-of-way or other public utilities subject to state or federal regulation, where no new street or easement of access is created. 
D.	A conveyance made to correct a description in a prior conveyance.
E.	Any transfer by operation of law.
Sec. 106-134. - Conditions. 
    Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to land subdivision is in the public interest and an exercise of valid police power delegated by the state to the city. The subdivision of land is a privilege conferred upon the developer by the laws of the State of Kansas and through these subdivision regulations. It is the developer who is seeking to acquire the advantages of lot subdivision and upon him/her rests the duty of compliance with the requirements of this article, all other applicable provisions of the Iola Municipal Code, and reasonable conditions imposed by the planning commission and/or the city commission in order to ensure that the city's public health, safety and general welfare are provided for and protected. 
Sec. 106-135. - Design standards. 
A.	Scope. All subdivisions of land subject to these subdivision regulations shall conform to the design standards of this article. 
B.	Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. 
1.	In addition to the regulations established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following laws, rules and regulations:

2.	Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformance with the intention, purpose and guidelines of these subdivision regulations. 
C.	Access. All lots located in any subdivision shall be served directly by a public street except that private streets may be permitted as a part of a Planned Development. 
D.	Streets. 
1.	In all new subdivisions, streets shall conform to the functional classification as specified in the comprehensive plan. Streets shall be designed and located in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to the terrain, to such natural features as streams and tree growth, to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of the land served by such streets, and to the most advantageous development of the adjoining area. Each lot within the subdivision shall provide access to a dedicated public street. Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary line of the tract being subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions; or unless the opinion of the planning commission and city commission is that such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts. 
2.	The standards within these subdivision regulations recognize and reference subdivision streets by functional classification. 
3.	Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited access highway, or where lots back onto a public street, the subdivision shall provide the following treatment: 
a.	In residential districts a buffer strip at least 50 feet in depth shall be provided in addition to the normal lot depth required. The strip shall be a part of the platted lots and shall have the following restriction letter on the face of the plat: 
"This strip reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner or developer: the building of structures heron is prohibited." 
b.	In commercial and industrial districts adjacent to limited access highways, no parallel street shall be less than 150 feet from said right-of-way or limited access highway. 
4.	Streets shall intersect each other at right angles unless otherwise dictated by topography or other factors of good design. 
a.	The number of intersections along major streets shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practical the distance between such intersections shall not be less than 1,200 feet. 
b.	Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of 15 feet. The planning director may require a greater radius where anticipated traffic justifies such a requirement. 
c.	Streets parallel to a limited access highway shall, when intersecting a major street, highway or a collector street shall be located at a minimum distance of 250 feet from said right-of-way, highway or collector street. Such distance, when desirable and practical, shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
d.	Local streets need not continue across major or collector streets, however, the planning director may require an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities. 
5.	Half streets. Where an existing dedicated or platted half street is adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other half of the street right-of-way shall be dedicated by the subdivider. Half-street dedications for minor streets are not permitted, unless there is satisfactory agreement with the city that both adjacent developers agree to dedicate and construct one-half of the street. 
6.	Street names. Street names shall be suggested by the developer and approved by the city commission at the time of the final plat approval. 
7.	Sight distance triangle. Minimum sight distance shall be provided at each intersection by not erecting, placing, or planting an item in such a manner as to materially impede vision between a height of two feet and eight feet above curb grade within the triangular area formed by imaginary lines that begin at the intersection and follow street pavement edges for 25 feet and are connected by a line drawn across the lot. 
8.	Cul-de-sac streets. Cul-de-sac streets shall be not more than 500 feet in length measured from the centerline of the cul-de-sac to the centerline of the connecting street. Exceptions may be made where topographic or other unusual existing conditions so require. Culs-de-sac shall terminate with a minimum outside property line turnaround radius of 50 feet and a minimum curb line radius of 39 feet. The use of a "T" design for the culs-de-sac terminus may be considered for culs-de-sac of short length (less than 300 feet) when specifically approved by the city commission with the recommendation of the planning commission and planning director. 
9.	Decorative islands. When specifically reviewed by the planning commission and approved by the city commission, islands to be used for landscaping, statuary or other decorative purposes may be constructed by a developer in a dedicated reserve in the center of a cul-de-sac or other roadway pavement section. Decorative islands shall not be approved if it is possible that their installation would in any way impede traffic or create unsafe condition, as directed by the planning director. 
If decorative islands are approved, the developer shall, as condition of such approval, assign full responsibility for maintenance of such islands to the homeowners' association created by the developer for the subdivision. 
10.	Private streets. Private streets are generally unacceptable in subdivisions in which any of the streets are dedicated to the public. Exceptions will be considered in commercial and industrial subdivisions if they are constructed to the standards of this Section and in planned developments. A homeowner's association or business district association shall be formed to maintain any private street. 
11.	Street names and signs. Street names shall not duplicate names of any existing street in the city and adjacent communities except where a new street is a continuation of an existing street. Street names that are spelled differently but sound the same shall be avoided. Generally no street should change direction by more than 90 degrees without a change in street name. The street name pattern established by the city shall be continued. Night glowing street signs, approved by the planning director, will be purchased and installed at all street intersections by the developer at the developer's expense. 
12.	Standard street sections and details. The subsections, which follow, set forth standard street sections and details which are to be used for future residential, collector, and thoroughfare streets constructed within the city. For items not addressed within this article see Appendix A, APWA Design Criteria-Streets.

In cut areas, the top of the subgrade under areas to be paved shall be scarified and compacted to a minimum depth of six inches to not less than 95 percent of standard maximum density at optimum moisture. Maximum density shall be determined in accordance with requirements of the Standard Compaction Test. 
d.	Approval of subgrade. The city engineer shall approve the subgrade before any base course or surface is placed thereon. The subgrade shall be constructed so that it will be uniform in density throughout. The entire width and length shall conform to line, grade, and typical cross-section shown on the plans or as established by the planning director. If any settling or washing occurs, or where hauling results in ruts or other objectionable irregularities, the contractor shall re-shape and re-roll the subgrade before the base or surfacing is placed. 
e.	Sewer and water work before base construction. No base course work may proceed on any street until all trenching for storm and sanitary sewers and for water lines within an area extending one foot behind curbs has been properly backfilled satisfactory to the planning director. Wherever possible, the developer shall schedule installation of gas or buried electric utility lines so that the trenches for such lines can be properly backfilled before street base course construction. 
f.	Storm sewer and inlets. Manholes, storm sewers, inlets and utility valves shall be adjusted to meet the proper grade of street or yard areas to the satisfaction of the planning director.

a.	Where the proposed subdivision is a re-subdivision or concerns an area presently having any or all required improvements as previously set out and where such improvements meet the requirements of this section and are in good condition as determined by the planning director, no further provisions need to be made by the subdivider to duplicate such improvements. However, where such existing improvements do not meet said requirements as determined by the planning director, the subdivider shall provide for the repair, correction, or replacement of such improvements so that all final improvements will then meet said requirements as determined by the planning director. 
b.	Where the proposed subdivision is a re-subdivision or concerns an area presently abutting or continuing any existing public street of less than the minimum required right-of-way width or roadway width, land shall be dedicated so as to provide a minimum street right-of-way width established by these subdivision regulations or by the policy of the city commission; and the subdivider of such proposed subdivision shall provide an additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards set by these subdivision regulations. The city commission shall determine what adjustment to make where the aforesaid widening merges with existing streets, which are of smaller width at the boundary of such proposed subdivision. The city commission may reduce the minimum roadway system in the proposed subdivision if the extension of such roadway is already improved at each end of such roadway in the subdivision and the roadway in the proposed subdivision is two blocks or less in length. 
E.	Block and lot design. The lengths, widths, and shape of lots shall be suited for the planned use of the land, zoning requirements, and need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic and the limitations and opportunities of the terrain. Block lengths in residential areas shall not, as a general rule, be greater than 600 feet in length between street lines unless dictated by exceptional terrain or other limiting factors of good design. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.

Secs. 106-140-106-145. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XI. - FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS 

Sec. 106-146. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, and purposes. 
A.	Statutory authorization. 
1.	Approval of draft article by Kansas Chief Engineer prior to adoption. The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on December 28, 2005. 
2.	Kansas statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Commission of Iola, Kansas, ordains as follows: 
B.	Findings of fact. 
1.	Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of Iola, Kansas, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.	General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
3.	Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
a.	Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated July 18, 2011, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
b.	Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
c.	Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
d.	Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
e.	Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
C.	Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 106-146.B.1., Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation; to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this article to: 
1.	Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.	Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
3.	Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 3393, § 1, 4-4-11)
Sec. 106-147. - General provisions. 
A.	Lands to which article applies. This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of Iola, Kansas identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones, AE, AO, and AH zones, on the index map dated July 18, 2011, of the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by the article, no development shall be permitted except thereto. In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city commission or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city commission or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in section 106-149 "Provisions for flood hazard reduction." 
B.	Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
C.	Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
D.	Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes. 
E.	Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create a liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made there under. 
F.	Severability. If any section; clause; provision; or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected thereby.

Sec. 106-149. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.	General standards. 
1.	No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial-improvements, and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes, within any numbered or unnumbered A zones, AE, AO, and AH zones, unless the conditions of this section are satisfied. 
2.	All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within unnumbered A zones is subject to all provisions of this article. If flood insurance study data is not available, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources. 
3.	Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted within any unnumbered or numbered A zones, or AE zones on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
4.	All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial-improvements, prefabricated structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments shall require: 
a.	Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
b.	Construction with materials resistant to flood damage;
c.	Utilization of methods and practices that minimize flood damages;
d.	All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment, and other service facilities be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
e.	New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination; and 
f.	Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, located within special flood hazard areas are required to assure that: 
(1)	All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2)	All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; 
(3)	Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
(4)	All proposals for development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, of five acres or 50 lots, whichever is lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data. 
5.	Storage, material, and equipment.
a.	The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
b.	Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning. 
B.	Specific standards. In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones, AE, and AH zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 106-149.A.2., Provisions for flood hazard reduction, the following provisions are required: 
1.	Residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above base flood elevation. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor. 
2.	Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor. Such certifications shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.	Require, for all new construction and substantial-improvements that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.	A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and 
b.	The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. 
C.	Manufactured homes. 
1.	All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A zones, AE, and AH zones, on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. 
2.	Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A zones, AE, and AH zones, on the community's FIRM on sites: 
a.	Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
b.	In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
c.	In an expansion to and existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
d.	In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial-damage as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor. 
3.	Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A zones, AE and AH zones, on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of section 106-149.C.2., Provisions for flood hazard reduction, manufactured homes, be elevated so that either: 
a.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of one foot above the base flood level; or 
b.	The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor. 
D.	Areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in section 106-147.A., Lands to which article applies, are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply: 
1.	AO zones. 
a.	All new construction and substantial-improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
b.	All new construction and substantial-improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
c.	Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
2.	AH zones. 
a.	The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation has been provided shall be required as set forth in section 106-149.B., Specific standards. 
b.	Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
E.	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 106-147.A., Lands to which article applies, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.	The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. 
2.	The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
3.	If section 106-149.E.2., Provisions for flood hazard reduction, floodway, is satisfied, all new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 106-149, Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
4.	In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in section 106-149.A.2., Provisions for flood hazard reduction, general standards. 
F.	Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A zones, AE, AH, and AO zones on the community's FIRM shall either: 
1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or
2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use*; or
3.	Meet the permitting, elevation, and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this article. 
*  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
Sec. 106-150. - Floodplain management variance procedures. 
A.	Establishment of appeal board. The board of zoning appeals, referred to as the appeal board, as established by the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management requirements of this Unified Development Code. 
B.	Responsibility of appeal board. Where an application for a floodplain development permit is denied by the floodplain administrator, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit directly to the appeal board, as defined in section 106-150, Floodplain management variance procedures. 
    The appeal board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
C.	Further appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court as provided in K.S.A. 12-759 and 12-760. 
D.	Floodplain management variance criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the appeal board shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and the following criteria: 
1.	Danger to life and property due to flood damage;
2.	Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
3.	Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.	Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
5.	Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
6.	Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
7.	Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8.	Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.	Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
10.	Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and, 
11.	Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. 
E.	Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
1.	Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided items 2 through 6 below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the state Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provide the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
3.	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood discharge would result. 
4.	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.	Variances shall only be issued upon: (a) showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.	A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: (a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (b) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article. 
Sec. 106-151. - Penalties for violation. 
    Penalties and civic remedies for violations to this article shall be as set forth in article XIII, Violations and Enforcement. 
Sec. 106-152. - Amendments. 
    The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this article may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, provided, however, that no such action may be taken until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties of interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the public hearing. A copy of such amendments will be provided to the FEMA Region VII office. The regulations of this article are in compliance with the NFIP regulations.

ARTICLE XII. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 106-160. - General provisions. 
A.	Purpose. Within the zoning districts established by this Unified Development Code or previously existing regulations, there are uses, structures, lots, signs and other current circumstances that were lawful prior to the effective date of this Unified Development Code that would now be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the provisions of this Unified Development Code. These instances are considered nonconformities. The purpose of this article is to establish regulations that govern these nonconforming uses, structures, lots, signs and other current circumstances. 
B.	Applicability. The regulations of this article shall apply to the following types of nonconformities: 
1.	Nonconforming uses. Uses legally established prior to the effective date of this Unified Development Code that do not conform with the use regulations of the district that the use is located are referred to as "nonconforming uses." Temporary uses shall not qualify as "nonconforming uses." 
2.	Nonconforming structures. Buildings and structures, not including signs, legally established prior to the effective date of this Unified Development Code that do not conform with the property development standards of the zoning district that the use is located in, are referred to as "nonconforming structures." Temporary structures shall not qualify as "nonconforming structures." 
3.	Nonconforming lots. Any lot having insufficient area, width, or depth for the zoning district in which it is located, which was legally platted and recorded prior to the effective date of this Unified Development Code is referred to as a "nonconforming lot." 
4.	Nonconforming signs. Signs legally established prior to the effective date of this Unified Development Code that do not conform to the sign regulations are referred to as "nonconforming signs." Temporary signs shall not qualify as "nonconforming signs." 
5.	Other nonconformities. Other situations which were legally established prior to the effective date of this Unified Development Code, but do not conform to the regulations of this Unified Development Code, including but not limited to: (1) fence height or location; (2) lack of or inadequate landscape buffers; (3) lack of or inadequate landscaping; lack of or inadequate off-street parking; and (4) other nonconformities not involving zoning district use or property development standards are referred to as "other nonconformities". 
C.	Policy. It is the general policy of the city to allow uses, structures, lots, signs and other situations that came into existence legally and in conformance with then-applicable requirements but that do not conform to all of the applicable requirements of this Unified Development Code to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such circumstance into conformance with this Unified Development Code as is reasonably practicable, all subject to the limitations of this article. The limitations of this article are intended to recognize the interests of the property owner in continuing to use the property but to control the expansion of the nonconformity and to control reestablishment of abandoned uses and limit re-establishment of buildings and structures that have been substantially destroyed. 
D.	Authority to continue. Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the regulations of this article. 
E.	Determination of nonconformity status. The burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists is to the owner and not the city. 
F.	Repair and maintenance. Repairs and normal maintenance required to keep nonconforming structures and nonconforming signs in a safe condition shall be permitted, provided that no alterations shall be made except those allowed by this article or required by law or ordinance. 
G.	Change of tenancy or ownership. Changes of tenancy, ownership or management of an existing nonconformity shall be permitted, provided there is no change in the nature or character, extent or intensity of such nonconformity. 
Sec. 106-161. - Nonconforming uses. 
    Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following standards: 
A.	Enlargement. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy a greater area of land or floor areas than was occupied on the effective date of this Unified Development Code and no additional accessory use, building or structure shall be established on the site of a nonconforming use. This provision notwithstanding, uses may be extended throughout any part of a building or other structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use prior to the effective date of this Unified Development Code. 
B.	Relocation. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or part to any other portion of such parcel or to another lot unless the use will be in conformance with the use regulations of the district into which it is moved. 
C.	Discontinuance and abandonment. If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of more than six consecutive months (except where Government action causes such cessation), the subsequent use of such parcel or lot shall conform to the regulations and provisions set by this Unified Development Code for the district that such parcel or lot is located. 
When a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
D.	Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its structural value prior to such destruction, such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations, of the zoning district that it is located. The city shall make the determination of such reduced structural valuation. 
When such damage or destruction is 50 percent or less, no repair or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained within six months of the damage or destruction and restoration is completed within one year after the date that such permit is issued. The time limit may be extended upon the recommendation of the planning commission and the approval of city commission. 
E.	Change in use. A nonconforming use may be changed to a new use, provided that the new use shall be of the same general character or of a character less intensive (and thus more closely conforming) than the existing, nonconforming use. The planning director shall make the initial determination of whether a proposed use is a conforming use or is less intense, with an appeal to the board of zoning appeals. A nonconforming use may not thereafter be changed back to a less conforming use than what it was changed from. 
F.	Residential uses in nonresidential districts. The other provisions of this section notwithstanding, any structure that is devoted to a nonconforming residential use and that is located in a C-O or more intensive district may be remodeled, extended, expanded and enlarged; provided that after any such remodeling, extension, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work. 
A structure being used for a nonconforming residential use may be rebuilt for residential purposes in the event of damage or destruction as defined in section 160-161.D., Damage or destruction, regardless of the percent of the damage or destruction, provided a building permit is obtained within one year of the damage or destruction 
G.	Accessory uses. No use that is an accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use ceases or terminates. 
Sec. 106-162. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following standards. 
A.	Enlargement. Any expansion of a nonconforming structure that increases the degree of nonconformance shall be prohibited. Other expansions of the structure shall be permitted and shall not require a variance. The planning director shall make the initial determination of whether a proposed expansion increases the degree of nonconformity, with an appeal to the board of zoning appeals. 
B.	Relocation. Nonconforming structures shall not be moved unless the movement or relocation will bring the structure into compliance with all applicable zoning district regulations. 
C.	Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its structural value prior to such destruction, such structure shall not be restored except in conformance with the regulations for the zoning district that it is located. When a structure is damaged to the extent of 50 percent or less, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained within six months of the damage or destruction, and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. The city shall make the determination of such reduced structural valuation. 
Sec. 106-163. - Nonconforming lots. 
    Nonconforming lots shall be subject to the following standards. 
A.	Alteration. No nonconforming lot, or any portion thereof, shall be altered, used or sold in a manner that would increase its degree of nonconformity. 
B.	Single-family residential construction. The planning director may issue a building permit for a single-family residential home on any nonconforming lot provided the following: 
1.	The lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of such a lot would have been permitted. 
2.	The lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been prohibited. 
3.	All yard setback and zoning requirements for the district in which is located can be met. 
4.	All minimum standards for providing access to streets, water service and sanitary sewer can be met. 
Sec. 106-164. - Nonconforming signs. 
    Nonconforming signs may continue to be displayed, subject to the following standards: 
A.	Whenever a non-conforming sign is damaged by fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot or act of nature, it may be reconstructed and used as before provided it is reconstructed within three months after such calamity, unless the damage to the sign is 50 percent or more of its replacement value, in this case the reconstructed sign shall comply with the provisions of article IX, Signs. 
B.	Whenever it is desired to change or alter the structural elements of an existing non-conforming sign, such as the supports, size of the sign area, shape of the sign area or lighting, such alteration shall constitute a major change and the sign shall be made to conform and comply with the provisions of article IX, Signs, within six months after the application for a permit to alter the sign has been filed with the planning director. Changes in the size or shape of an existing non-conforming sign in excess of ten percent shall constitute a major change and the sign shall be made to conform and comply with the provisions of this Unified Development Code. A change in shape from one corporate logo to another or one shape to another shall not constitute a major change and is not required to come into conformance with the provisions of the Unified Development Code as long as the change does not increase the overall size of the sign in excess of ten percent. 
Sec. 106-165. - Other nonconformities. 
A.	Enlargement or change in use. Where an addition, enlargement or change in use is proposed to an extent in excess of 25 percent of the floor area of the existing buildings or structures, the entire lot shall be brought into conformance with presently existing requirements of this Unified Development Code as to landscaping, buffering, off-street parking and other non-use and non-property development regulations of this Unified Development Code. 
Sec. 106-166. - Nonconformities created by public action. 
    When lot area or setbacks are reduced as a result of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least 75 percent of the required minimum standard for the district that it is located, then that lot shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot size and setback standards of this Unified Development Code without resort to the board of zoning appeals.

SECTION 5202. FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICAITON OF STREETS. 
5202.1 Major Arterial Streets (or Primary Arterial, or Urban Principal Arterial): Streets that serve the highest traffic volume corridors and the longest trip. Provides travel between business districts and outlying residential areas, between major inner city communities and between major suburban centers, and connects communities to major state and interstate highways. No or limited access is allowed from residential streets. Access is usually partially controlled. Spacing of major arterial streets is generally from one mile to 5 miles. 
5202.2 Minor Arterial Streets (or Secondary Arterial, or Urban Minor Arterial): Streets that interconnect and augment the major arterial streets. No or limited access is allowed from residential lots. Accommodate trips of moderate length at a lower level of travel mobility than major arterial streets. Spacing of minor arterial streets is generally from one-half mile to 3 miles. 
5202.3 Industrial/Commercial Collector (or Collector, or Urban Collector): Streets that collect traffic to and from commercial or industrial areas and distribute it to arterial streets. 
5202.4 Residential Collector Streets (or Collector, or Urban Collector): Streets that collect traffic to and from residential areas and distribute it to arterial streets. Limited access is allowed from residential lots. Desirable maximum ADT = 3,000 for residential collector streets. 
5202.5 Residential Local Streets (or Local, or Urban Local): Streets that only carry traffic having its origin or destination within the immediate neighborhood. Desirable maximum ADT = 1,000 for local streets. (ADT = 10 trips per day per typical single-family residence.) 
5202.6 Residential Access Streets: Streets that carry traffic between residential lots and residential local streets or residential collector streets. Residential access streets usually carry no through traffic and include short loop streets, culs-de-sac, and courts. Desirable maximum ADT = 200 for culs-de-sac and 400 for loop streets. Maximum length of culs-de-sac = 500 feet and 1,000 feet for loop streets (ADT = ten trips per day per typical single-family residence.)

(within 25 ft.)Minimum Spacing of Similar Roadways(See Section 5202)1/4 mile200 ft.175 ft. 
Notes: 
1.  At end of cul-de-sac, minimum design speed = 10 mph; with corresponding minimum horizontal radius = 25 ft.; minimum stopping sight distance = 75 ft.; minimum K Crest = 3; and minimum K Sag = 5 (2 with lighting). 
2.  All street design is subject to local governing agency approval. 
3.  K values for crest and sag vertical curves may be determined using the chart on figure 1 or 2, or in accordance with AASHTO - A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. Figure III-41 and III-43. The upper range K value shown on page 52-3 [the above table] shall be used unless otherwise approved by the local governing agency. 
4.  See figure 4 for typical residential street layout. 
5.  Consideration should be given to providing a 15 ft. minimum wide utility easement along each side of the right-of-way for residential access streets and 10 ft. wide utility easements for all other streets. 
6.  Absolute maximum grade = 10% for residential collectors, 13% for residential local streets, and 15% for residential access streets. 
7.  Absolute minimum grade = 0.8% and should only be used for relatively short distances. 
8.  The 10.5 ft. lane width for residential access streets shall only be used in a planned development where a minimum of four off-street parking spaces are provided for each dwelling unit. 
9.  30 mph design speed with corresponding horizontal and vertical curve design criteria may be used for industrial commercial collector streets under special conditions when approved by the City Engineer. 
10.  The minimum radii shown is based on the AASHTO design for low-speed urban streets with no super elevation except for major arterials. The minimum radii for major arterials is based on 2% super elevation. 
5203.2 Maximum and Minimum Gradient: The maximum and minimum gradient for streets as noted in Section 5203.1 may be exceeded only upon written approval of the City. 
5203.3 Shoulder Gradients: The finished grade within the limits of the right-of-way shall slope from 2% one-quarter (1/4) inch vertical to one foot horizontal minimum, to 4% one-half (1/2) inch vertical to one foot horizontal maximum measured above the back of the curb. The grading gradients may be varied only upon written approval of the City. Back slopes beyond the R/W line shall be 3:1 maximum, 4:1 desirable. 
5203.4 Tangent Length: No tangent length shall be required between reverse curves for residential access and local streets. The minimum tangent length between reverse curves shall be 100 feet for collector/industrial streets. Major and minor arterial streets shall comply with current AASHTO guidelines. 
5203.5 Off-Center Street Intersections: Off-center street intersections shall be separated as shown on Figure 3(M). 
5203.6 Intersection Angle: It is desirable for all intersections to meet at approximately a 90 degree angle. Skewed intersections should be avoided and in no case should the angle be less than 75 degrees. 
5203.7 Intersecting Minor/Major Arterial Streets: Where any minor or major arterial streets intersect each other, the crowns of both streets shall be uniformly transitioned into a plane at the intersection unless otherwise approved. Changes from one cross slope to another should be gradual. 
5203.8 Curb Radii: When 2 streets of different classification intersect, the higher classification street shall govern the curb radii dimension listed in 5203.1. Equivalent three-center compound curves may be used in lieu of a single radius curve. Curb ends facing the flow of traffic shall have a 5-foot taper from full height to zero. 
5203.9 Sight Distance at Intersecting Streets: Sight distance triangles at intersecting side streets shall be in accordance with the current edition of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, AASHTO. Every effort shall be made to select intersection locations so that the maximum sight distance is possible. 
5203.10 Considerations for Connection to Existing and Future Streets: Consideration shall be given to the horizontal and vertical alignment of roadways where they connect to existing streets or where roadways may be extended in the future. Where a new street is to connect to an existing street, all deteriorated or cracked asphalt within 5 feet of the connection point shall be removed to a point where sound material is found. Existing pavement is to be saw cut for the entire width of the street to a minimum depth of 6 inches. If full-depth pavement removal is required, the subgrade shall be re-compacted to 95% of standard density. 
5203.11 Pavement Section: Pavement shall be constructed upon compacted subgrade and of materials and the minimum thickness as shown on the standard drawings for the applicable street classification. 
5203.12 Pavement Transition: Reduction in pavement width in the direction of traffic flow shall be accomplished by a taper. The minimum desirable length for merging taper shall be determined by the formula L = WS2/60 where posted speeds are 45 mph or less. The formula L = W x S should be used for roadways having a posted speed limit greater than 45 mph. Under either formula, L = taper length in feet, W = width of the closed lane in feet, and S = design speed in mph. 
5203.13 Culs-de-Sac: At locations where streets are to be terminated and a vehicular connection between adjacent streets is not required, the termination shall be a cul-de-sac. Such cul-de-sac shall be constructed with a minimum radius of 39 feet to the back of the curb if there are no islands located in the cul-de-sac. 
5203.14 Temporary Turn-Arounds: At locations where streets will be temporarily terminated and which will be extended at a later date, and said street extends beyond the intersection of an adjacent street more than 150 feet, a temporary cul-de-sac shall be constructed with a minimum radius of 35 feet. The temporary cul-de-sac shall be constructed of asphaltic concrete with a minimum depth of 8 inches. Curb and gutter will not be required. The cul-de-sac shall be constructed within the limits of temporary easement. 
Temporary turn-arounds shall be located so that they do not interfere with permanent development. They should normally be located on property adjacent to the property to be served. For new subdivision plats, they should be located on property beyond the limits of the plat. 
5203.15 Driveway Grades: Driveway grades shall conform to the typical section of the street within the right-of-way. Any deviations shall be approved by the local government official with the following limitations: Driveways shall attain a minimum elevation of 6 inches above the gutter elevation within the right-of-way with a maximum grade of 8%. The algebraic difference in grades at the right-of-way on crest drives shall be 8% maximum and on sag drives shall be 12% maximum. The maximum driveway grade outside the right-of-way shall be 15%. 
5203.16 Access for the Disabled: Ramps shall be required at all planned sidewalk-curb intersections in accordance with standard practice and approved by the City. Non-standard driveways and alleys will also be designed to accommodate the handicapped. 
5203.17 Street Lighting: All street lighting shall be designed in accordance with Section 5800 of the APWA design criteria unless otherwise directed or approved by the City. 
5203.18 Storm Drainage: All storm drainage shall be designed in accordance with Section 5600 of the APWA design criteria unless otherwise directed or approved by the City. 
5203.19 Underdrains: In areas that have known subsurface moisture problems, underdrains or drainage blankets shall be designed. 
5203.20 Erosion Control within R/W Limits: As a minimum, all grass areas in the R/W shall be seeded and mulched to control erosion on to the roadway. All construction projects that have exposed grading require temporary erosion control measures. Temporary erosion control must be approved by the City Engineer. 
5203.21 Survey Monument Boxes: Monument boxes conforming to Figure 5 shall be installed at all quarter section corners involved in the street construction. The monument boxes shall be set by a Registered Land Surveyor licensed in the state the monumentation work is performed. 
5203.22 Traffic Impact Studies: Required where developments have adverse impact on existing traffic conditions. 
5203.23 Obstructions: Rigid structures such as poles and hydrants shall be placed a minimum horizontal distance of 1.5 feet from the face of curb to edge of obstruction. When required, guardrail and barricades shall be installed in accordance with the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide or local policies. Vertical clearance of a minimum 14.5 feet shall be provided. Along sidewalks, a minimum vertical clearance of 7 feet shall be provided.
