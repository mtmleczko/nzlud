PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Holly Springs, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1991 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1991 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Betty Cloer, City Clerk, and Mr. Robert M. Dyer, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

(a)  Purpose. Residents of the city as well as persons doing business with the municipal government have a right to expect that city officials will behave in a manner conducive to promoting public confidence in the municipal government. The purpose of this code is to: 
(1)  Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all city officials; 
(2)  Establish guidelines for the conduct that is to be expected of city officials at meetings, events, and appearances sponsored by the city; 
(3)  Require disclosure of all conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, by city officials in matters concerning or affecting the city; and 
(4)  Set forth disciplinary measures that may be taken against city officials who choose to violate the code of ethics and conduct. 
(b)  City officials. The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to the following city officials: the mayor; members of the city council; and members of the planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals, and any additional board(s) that may be established and duly appointed by the mayor and council. 
(c)  Prohibited activities. No city official shall: 
(1)  Provide reason by his or her conduct for the impression that any person can improperly influence him or her or unduly enjoy his or her favor in the performance of official acts; 
(2)  Use his or her official position to secure or attempt to secure privileges that are not available to the general public; 
(3)  Perform any activity or engage in any transaction that is prohibited by law now existing or hereafter enacted which is applicable to him or her by virtue of being a city official; 
(4)  Directly or indirectly request, exact, receive, or agree to receive a loan, gift, favor, promise, or thing of value for himself or herself or another person if it could reasonably be considered to influence the city official in the discharge of official duties. This shall not apply in the case of an occasional non-pecuniary gift of insignificant value; an award publicly presented in recognition of public service; a commercially reasonable loan or other financial transaction made in the ordinary course of business by an institution or individual authorized by the laws of Georgia to engage in the making of such a loan or financial transaction; and campaign contributions made and reported in accordance with state law; 
(5)  Disclose or otherwise use confidential information acquired by virtue of his or her position for his or her or another person's private gain; 
(6)  Engage in, or accept employment with, or render services for any private business or professional activity when such employment or rendering of services is adverse to and incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties. This shall not apply to a city official who is a licensed professional and appears on behalf of any applicant in such professional capacity so long as disclosures required by subsection (d) are made to the mayor and city council 30 days prior to any action being taken, and the member is associated with the project at the time the initial application is filed; 
(7)  Use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to himself or herself or persons having an interest; 
(8)  Use government property of any kind for other than officially approved activities, nor direct employees to use such property for any purposes other than those officially approved; and 
(9)  Use his or her position to request or require an employee of the city to do clerical work on behalf of the city official's family, business, social club, church, or fraternal interest when such work is not furthering a legitimate city interest; perform any work outside the employee's normal course of employment with the city; purchase goods or services to be used for personal, business, or political purposes; and work for the city official personally without paying the employee just compensation. 
(d)  Disclosure of conflicts of interest. An appointed city official (i.e., members of planning and zoning commission and other boards appointed by the city council) who has a financial interest that he or she has reason to believe may be affected by his or her official acts or actions shall disclose the precise nature of such financial interest by written or verbal statement 30 days prior to the city council's taking official action on a matter affecting such interest, and shall abstain from discussion and voting. An elected city official (i.e., the mayor and members of the city council) shall disclose the nature of any financial interest he or she has at the time such matter is presented to the mayor and city council for discussion. Such written or verbal statements shall be recorded into the minutes of the meeting and thus become part of the public record. Following any disclosure made pursuant to this section, the member shall refrain from all ex-parte communications with other members regarding the application in which he or she has a financial interest. 
(e)  Prohibited contracts. The city council shall not enter into any contract involving services or property with a member of the city council or with a business in which a member of the city council has a financial interest. This shall not apply in the case of the designation of a bank or trust company as a depository of city funds; the borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution which offers the lowest available rate of interest in the community for such loan; contracts entered into in accordance with the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; or contracts entered into under circumstances that constitute an emergency situation, provided that the mayor or his designee prepares a written record explaining the emergency. 
(f)  Prohibited conduct at public meetings, hearings, events, and appearances. No city official shall:

(2)  Treat any member of the general public or other city official or employee in a fashion designed to demean, degrade, or humiliate that individual; 
(3)  Intentionally and/or repeatedly violate Robert's Rules of Order, the general guidelines by which the city council and appointed boards of the city conduct their meetings. 
(g)  Exceptions. This Code section is not intended to apply in the following circumstances: 
(1)  City officials are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community do; 
(2)  City officials retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights; 
(3)  It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for city officials to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material, and avoidable; 
(4)  City officials are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain their investments; and 
(5)  It is possible and reasonable to require city officials to engage in employment, professional or business activities and to maintain investments which do not impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the community. 
(h)  Hearings and determinations. Upon the sworn complaint of any person alleging facts that, if proven to be true, would constitute a violation of this Code section as determined by the city manager and the city attorney, the city council shall conduct a public hearing at which the accused city official shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either personally or through counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing, the city council shall, in written findings of fact and conclusions based thereon, make a determination concerning the propriety of the conduct of the city official in question. The primary actions available to the city council concerning a determined instance of violation by a city official of this Code section are:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 26-2017, § 1, adopted December 18, 2017, amended art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. II, §§ 10-31-10-63, pertained to adult entertainment, and derived from Ord. of May 28,1996, § 5.4-32(1)-(26); Ord. of March 20, 2006(2), §§ 1, 3, 4-7. 

Sec. 10-31. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

(Ord. of 8-4-08, § 1) 
Sec. 14-92. - Exceptions. 
    No dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog as a result of an injury upon a human being or other animal inflicted at a time when the dog was being used by a law enforcement officer to carry out the law enforcement officer's official duties. No dog shall be considered a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog as a result of an injury inflicted by the dog upon a person who, at the time of injury, was committing a willful trespass or other tort; who was tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog or had done so in the past; or who was attempting to commit a crime. If the person injured is a child of tender years, the age, understanding, and capacity of such child shall be considered to determine whether such child was capable of committing a willful trespass or other tort or a crime. 
(Ord. of 8-4-08, § 1) 
Sec. 14-93. - Classification as dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog; notice to owner. 
(a)  When the animal control officer classifies any dog as a dangerous dog or a potentially dangerous dog under this article, the animal control officer shall notify the dog's owner of such classification. The notice to the owner shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the owner's last known address. If a dog has more than one owner, notice to one owner shall be sufficient for purposes of this article. If there is a question as to the dog's ownership, notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent to the last person who received a citation for the dog. 
(2)  The notice shall include a summary of the animal control officer's findings that form the basis for the dog's classification as a dangerous or a potentially dangerous dog. 
(3)  The notice shall be dated and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing on the classification within 15 days from the date of the notice. 
(4)  The notice shall state that the animal control hoard shall conduct the hearing. 
(5)  The notice shall state that if the owner does not request such a hearing within 15 days from the date of the notice, the classification of the dog as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog shall be final and conclusive for all purposes. 
(6)  The notice shall include a form to request a hearing before the animal control board and shall provide specific instructions on mailing or delivering such a request. 
(b)  When the animal control board receives a request for a hearing from an owner, it shall schedule such a hearing within 30 days of receipt of the request. The animal control board shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of the date, time, and place of the hearing; such notice shall be made to the owner at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence. 
    The animal control board shall also receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as it may find reasonably necessary to make a determination to sustain, modify, or overrule the classification of the dog by the animal control officer. Within ten days of the date of the hearing, the animal control board shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of its determination on the matter. If the determination is made that the dog is a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. 
    Unless the board determines that a later date is appropriate in a particular case, the effective date of the determination shall be the date of the animal control officer's classification. 
(c)  If the identity of the owner of a dog which the animal control officer has classified as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog cannot be determined, the dog shall be immediately confiscated. 
    If the dog's owner claims such a dog, the dog shall be released to its owner, together with a copy of the notice specified in subsection (a) of this section, upon proof of strict compliance with all provisions of this chapter. If the dog remains unclaimed for five days, the dog shall be euthanized in an expeditious and humane manner. Under no circumstances shall such dog be placed for adoption. In addition, all fees as described in this article must be paid before the dog will be released.

Cross reference- Environment, ch. 34; fire prevention and protection, ch. 38; health and sanitation, ch. 42; planning, ch. 54; solid waste, ch. 62; streets, sidewalks and other public places, ch. 66; utilities, ch. 78; zoning, ch. 82. 
State Law reference- Authority to adopt technical codes, Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ III(a)(12); minimum state construction codes, O.C.G.A. § 8-2-25. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 18-1. - Construction site portable toilets. 
(a)  Nonsewered toilets must be available to workers during the active construction process. If there are inactive construction periods of one month or more when no workers are on sites served by the unit, toilets are not required during such times. 
(b)  One unit may serve workers during the "active construction process" for up to four work sites, if all work sites are within 200 feet walking distance of the unit. The building inspector will not inspect/approve any inspection unless the nonsewered toilet system is within 200 feet and available for use. Location, sanitary maintenance, and use of a unit are the responsibility of the builder of the lot on which the unit is located. 
(c)  Compliance with these requirements will afford workers with proper sanitary facilities onsite and will reduce hazards to health and the environment. Building department officials will respond immediately to any complaint received concerning the lack of portable toilets on any construction site by simply shutting down all construction sites in the vicinity, which are not in compliance of the City of Holly Springs regulation. Implementation will begin on May 1, 2005. Inspectors will not perform requested building or technical trade inspections on any construction site within the city, which are not in compliance with the City of Holly Springs regulations and written interpretations. 
(d)  Construction sites within the city limits found in violation of regulations, in the opinion of a city building inspector, will be issued a complimentary notice of violation stating "NO NSTS," which will be attached to your building permit yard card. After placing this complimentary notice of violation on the permit yard card, the city inspector will leave the site without performing the requested inspection. There will be no exceptions to this position. The burden of compliance will remain with the permit holder. For first time violators for the same site inspections may easily be resumed upon notification from the permit holder, stating the violation site is in NSTS compliance. Permit holders may report compliance anytime during normal city work hours, but reinspections will be performed at any repeat violation site until written proof of compliance is received by the building department. 
(e)  As a guideline to help permit holders quickly gain compliance with the city regulations, the building department offers the following advise for proper placement and maintenance of portable toilets, so as not to delay construction schedules due to noncompliance to NSTS requirements: 
(1)  Portable toilets shall be installed in a reasonably level position and be easily accessible to users. 
(2)  Portable toilets shall not be located upon any public street or public right-of-way in Holly Springs. 
(3)  Portable toilets shall be located upon natural ground and not on an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete. 
(4)  Portable toilets must be located on buildable lots with written permission of the property owner. 
(5)  Portable toilets located within one- and two-family dwelling unit subdivisions must be located within 200 feet walking distance of the construction that it serves. 
(6)  Owners of property containing portable toilets are responsible for maintaining the portable toilets in a sanitary condition at all times. 
(7)  Portable toilets must be cleaned and serviced by a licensed NSTS service at least once per week, or more frequently as needed to maintain a sanitary use environment. 
(8)  Portable toilets shall be placed at least 100 feet from any body of water and installed in such a way as to insure that there is no possibility of a spill or run-off into any body of water. 
(9)  In cases where multiple builders or contractors are working in one subdivision, the city strongly urges all builders in that subdivision to meet and agree among themselves, where to initially locate portable toilets and then mutually agree where to relocate the portable toilets as construction progresses to maintain NSTS compliance. 
(Ord. of 2-24-05) 
Sec. 18-2. - Single- and multiple-station smoke alarms. 
(a)  Single- and multiple-station smoke alarms shall be installed in the following locations: 
(1)  In each sleeping room (local amendment). 
(2)  Outside of each separate sleeping area in the immediate vicinity of the bedrooms. 
(3)  On each additional story of the dwelling, including basements and cellars but not including crawl spaces and uninhabited attics. In dwellings or dwelling units with split-levels and without an intervening door between the adjacent levels, a smoke alarm installed on the upper level shall suffice for the adjacent lower level provided that the lower level is less than one full story below the upper level. 
(b)  When more than one smoke alarm is required to be installed within an individual dwelling unit the alarm devices shall be interconnected in such a manner that the actuation of one alarm will activate all of the alarms in the individual unit. The alarm shall be clearly audible in all bedrooms over background noise levels with all intervening doors closed. 
(c)  All smoke alarms shall be listed and installed in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the household fire warning equipment provisions of NFPA 72.

ARTICLE IX. - MASSAGE THERAPY PROFESSION-BODYWORK THERAPISTS AND BODYWORK THERAPY ESTABLISHMENTS[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. of January 21, 2010, § 1, repealed the former art. IX, §§ 22-260-22-281, and enacted a new art. IX as set out herein. The former art. IX pertained to massage establishments and derived from Ord. of October 17, 2005. 

Sec. 22-260. - Findings; public purpose. 
    The mayor and city council find that the general assembly has adopted O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-1, et seq. the "Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act," which imposes licensing requirements on massage therapists. The Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act and this article seek to clearly differentiate between the therapeutic and beneficial services of massage therapists, licensed by the Georgia Board of Massage Therapy, and other types of bodywork and massage businesses that are, in most instances, operated by persons who are not licensed by the Georgia Board of Massage Therapy. In fact, the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act does not impose any requirements upon those persons or establishments in the business of providing bodywork therapy. 
    The mayor and city council find that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to provide for the regulation of bodywork therapists and bodywork therapy establishments. Based upon research and the experience of other communities and municipalities, the mayor and city council find that certain bodywork therapy establishments beget and degenerate into undesirable community conditions including, but not limited to, depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the adverse impacts of bodywork therapy establishments. 
    However, the mayor and city council also find that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon certain constitutional rights of those wishing to operate licensed establishments. The mayor and city council find that qualified bodywork therapists have received extensive training to provide bodywork therapy that has been proven to be therapeutic; however, regulations are necessary to protect the public from unqualified practitioners. The mayor and city council find that it is in the best interests of the public to set guidelines and procedures for those who seek to practice bodywork therapy; to promote high standards of professional performance for those practicing bodywork therapy; and to protect the public from unprofessional conduct by persons licensed to practice bodywork therapy. 
    This article seeks to clearly differentiate between the therapeutic and beneficial services of bodywork therapists, and other types of bodywork and massage businesses that are, in most instances, operated by persons who have little or no formal training in bodywork therapy, and are commercial operations for illegal sexually oriented services. The mayor and city council find that state licensed massage therapists have received extensive training to provide massage therapy that has been proven to be therapeutic; however, regulations are necessary to protect the public from unqualified practitioners. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to differentiate from massage therapy and reasonably regulate bodywork therapy and bodywork therapy establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interests of reducing criminal activity, protecting property values, and providing for safe and sanitary conditions without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of licensed bodywork therapy establishments and their patrons.

ARTICLE XIII. - MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENTS AND PHARMACIES 

Sec. 22-400. - Purpose and findings. 
    Since the 1990's, the abuse of prescription opioids has risen dramatically, due in large part to the increase in the use of these analgesics to manage pain. 1 [] Opioids are prescribed to alleviate pain ranging from moderate to severe, as described by the patient. These analgesics principally affect the nervous system, suppressing the signals of pain sent to the brain; examples of these medications can include, but not be limited to morphine, codeine, oxycodone (e.g., OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet), and related drugs. As opioids "block the perception of pain" they also have the effect of creating a state of euphoria, which may be heightened when abused. Side effects can include drowsiness, nausea, constipation, and respiratory constraint. 
    Opioids are recognized as very effective when taken as prescribed for legitimate purposes, post surgery, for example. As the National Institute on Drug Abuse states, "Many studies have shown that the properly managed, short-term medical use of opioid analgesic drugs is safe and rarely causes addiction - defined as the compulsive and uncontrollable use of drugs despite adverse consequences - or dependence, which occurs when the body adapts to the presence of a drug, and often results in withdrawal symptoms when that drug is reduced or stopped." 4 [] Unfortunately, opioids taken long-term can create physical dependency in some patients, producing withdrawal symptoms when the medication is not taken. Cessation side effects can include bone pain, insomnia, and vomiting, to name a few. 
    Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the rise in the diversion of legal prescription drugs has grown exponentially, due to increased security at the borders and ports. 6 Amplified security has effectively reduced the supply of illegal drugs, traditionally smuggled by the drug trade, necessitating the need to find alternative methods of supplying drugs to users; consequently, legal prescription drugs are now being diverted to illegal uses - "Diversion." These diverted drugs are schedule II, III, and IV drugs, which principally include opioids as well as complementary drugs like Soma (Carisoprodol), a muscle relaxant, and Xanax (Alprazolam), an anti-anxiety medication. 7 [] 
    In recent years, South Florida, including Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Counties, have witnessed tremendous growth in the number of "pain clinics" that have opened in addition to the rapid increase of the diversion of prescription drugs. Broward County has been termed "The Painkiller Capital of the Unites States," and "The Columbia for Pharmaceutically Diverted Drugs." 8 Broward County had four pain clinics in 2007, jumping to 115 by November 2009, of a total of 176 such clinics in all of South Florida. 9 The majority of these pain clinics are nothing more than pill mills, diverting these scheduled drugs to illegal uses. As "clinics" have multiplied, the deaths due to overdoses of prescription drug medications, specifically opioids, have skyrocketed. 10 [] 
    With Broward County on the forefront of this epidemic, a grand jury was empanelled to investigate, issuing a report on November 19, 2009, after hearing testimony from prescription drug abusers and their families, federal and state law enforcement officials, physicians, prosecutors, and many more stakeholders. The report provides valuable information regarding the current state of this epidemic as well as recommendations to curtail this rapidly growing public safety concern. 
    As Broward County and other South Florida jurisdictions struggle to eliminate "pill mills," this outbreak of illicit pain clinics crossed into other states, notably Georgia and Texas. 11 In fact, the Cobb County Prescription Drug Task Force reports that in 2007, 82.46 percent overdose deaths statewide involved pharmaceuticals, going to 85.11 percent in 2008. Alprazolam, Hydrocodone, and Oxycodone were found to constitute the top five substances involved in all of these overdose deaths. 12 Soma and Xanax, are often combined with opioids as a "cocktail" distributed together at illegal pain clinics. 13 
    Illegal pain clinics commonly known as "pill mills" dispense large quantities of schedule II, III, and IV drugs for cash, with little examination of the patient conducted. Scheduled drugs are dispensed at these establishments or prescriptions are written to be filled at a legitimate pharmacy. Often, out of jurisdiction and out-of-state license plates are in the parking lots of these clinics, with individuals driving great distances to receive these "prescriptions." Pill mills often hire security guards to handle unruly patients and perhaps even scout for law enforcement. Individuals seeking these services will often fake an ailment, forging an MRI or providing falsified medical documentation to receive prescriptions. In turn, the physicians conduct lackadaisical examinations of these individuals, simply asking them "what they want" with regard to medication. 14 
    While studies and research illustrate that "pill mills" more often than not pose as "pain clinics," this perception can be inaccurate. Many legitimate pain clinics operate daily throughout the state and nation, faithfully treating their patients with the highest ethical standards. Pill mills are capable of posing as urgent care clinics, family medical practices, and neighborhood pharmacies, for example. In fact, any medical "store front" could operate as a pill mill. 
    The reality, however, is that the vast majority of medical establishments and pharmacies are absolutely legitimate. The City of Holly Springs City Council adopted a 12-month moratorium on the issuance of business licenses to "pain management clinics" on May 17, 2010, to conduct the proper research and vetting to create a new ordinance and municipal code addressing "pill mills." After thorough research, the city council has prepared this article to ensure that anyone dispensing or prescribing drugs within the city limits of Holly Springs is doing so in compliance with state law. Preliminary information will be gathered from proposed medical establishments and pharmacies to properly route the business through the applicable regulatory and zoning reviews, prior to the issuance of a business license (occupation tax permit).

( Ord. of 3-16-09 ) 
Sec. 42-34. - Findings and intent. 
    The City of Holly Springs does hereby find that: 
    The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's Report, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that (1) secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; (2) children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; (3) exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; (4) there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; (5) establishing smokefree workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke; and (6) evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smokefree policies and laws do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006.) 
    Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of approximately 53,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.) 
    The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.) 
    Based on a finding by the California Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, the California Air Resources Board has determined that secondhand smoke is a toxic air contaminant, finding that exposure to secondhand smoke has serious health effects, including low birth-weight babies; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); increased respiratory infections in children; asthma in children and adults; lung cancer, sinus cancer, and breast cancer in younger, premenopausal women; heart disease; and death. (Appendix II Findings of the Scientific Review Panel: Findings of the Scientific Review Panel on Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant as adopted at the Panel's June 24, 2005 Meeting," California Air Resources Board (ARB), September 12, 2005.) 
    Scientific evidence has firmly established that there is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, a pollutant that causes serious illness in adults and children. There is also indisputable evidence that implementing 100% smoke-free environments is the only effective way to protect the population from the harmful effects of exposure to secondhand smoke. (World Health Organization (WHO), "Protection from exposure to secondhand smoke: policy recommendations," World Health Organization (WHO), 2007.) 
    A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smokefree workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease. (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study," British Medical Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004.) Similar studies have been conducted in Bowling Green, Ohio; Monroe County, Indiana; Pueblo, Colorado; New York State; France; Greece; Italy; and Scotland. All of these studies have reached the conclusion that communities see an immediate reduction in heart attack admissions after the implementation of comprehensive smokefree laws. ([n.a.], "Bibliography of Secondhand Smoke Studies." American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, February 26, 2008.) 
    Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.) 
    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one or two cigarettes a day, and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal 328: 980-983, April 24, 2004.) 
    Given the fact that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smokefree environments. ASHRAE has determined that there is currently no air filtration or other ventilation technology that can completely eliminate all the carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by secondhand smoke exposure, and recommends that indoor environments be smokefree in their entirety. (Samet, J.; Bohanon, Jr., H.R.; Coultas, D.B.; Houston, T.P.; Persily, A.K.; Schoen, L.J.; Spengler, J.; Callaway, C.A., "ASHRAE position document on environmental tobacco smoke," American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), 2005.) 
    A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
    During periods of active smoking, peak and average outdoor tobacco smoke (OTS) levels measured in outdoor cafes and restaurant and bar patios near smokers rival indoor tobacco smoke concentrations. (Klepeis, N.; Ott, W.R.; Switzer, P., "Real-time measurement of outdoor tobacco smoke particles," Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association 57: 522-534, 2007.) 
    The society of actuaries has determined that secondhand smoke costs the U.S. economy roughly $10 billion a year: $5 billion in estimated medical costs associated with secondhand smoke exposure and $4.6 billion in lost productivity. (Behan, D.F.; Eriksen, M.P.; Lin, Y., "Economic Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke," Society of Actuaries, March 31, 2005.) 
    Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smokefree. Creation of smokefree workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A. & Smith, L. The effect of ordinances requiring smokefree restaurants on restaurant sales in the United States. American Journal of Public Health, 87:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, C.M., "The economic impact of smoke-free workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001.) 
    Hundreds of communities in the U.S., plus numerous states, including California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, have enacted laws requiring workplaces, restaurants, bars, and other public places to be smokefree, as have numerous countries, including Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, and Uruguay. 
    There is no legal or constitutional "right to smoke." Business owners have no legal or constitutional right to expose their employees and customers to the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke. On the contrary, employers have a common law duty to provide their workers with a workplace that is not unreasonably dangerous. 
    Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
    The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a positive danger to health, and a material public nuisance. 
    Accordingly, the City of Holly Springs finds and declares that the purposes of this ordinance are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

They may be considered for residential subdivisions to combat unsafe speeding and non-resident cut-through traffic when warranted. Caution must be exercised to carefully evaluate the reported traffic problems to ensure satisfaction of the minimum warrants and to ensure implementation of the correct traffic calming scenario. Based on experience, implementation of physical changes such as street closing, speed humps and tables often result in relocation of traffic problems to other parallel roadways. Traffic calming solutions with physical restrictions are only considered for subdivision or local streets. They will not be considered for roadways with a collector or higher classification without major review of the impact on the transportation system on local and regional level. 
( Ord. of 8-17-09, § 1 ) 
Sec. 74-148. - Traffic calming solutions.

(c)  Additional signage; 
(d)  Speed trailers; 
(e)  Permanent speed displays; 
(f)  Turn restrictions; 
(g)  Median chokers; 
(h)  Speed tables and humps; 
(i)  Street narrowing; 
(j)  Traffic circles; 
(k)  Street closures. 
( Ord. of 8-17-09, § 1 ) 
Sec. 74-149. - Speed humps and speed tables. 
(a)  Speed humps and speed tables should only be considered if other less restrictive measures have been employed and were not effective. In order to consider implementation of speed humps and speed tables, all of the following minimum warrants must be satisfied: 
    Warrant Threshold: 
(1)  Distance over 800 feet in length; 
(2)  Volume less than 1,600 vehicles per day (24-hour period); 
(3)  Posted speed 30 mph or less; 
(4)  Speed 30 percent over posted speed or ten percent over ten miles per hour over limit. 
(b)  In considering speed humps and speed tables, it is critical to note the following issues that generally are resultants of poor planning: 
(1)  A significant portion of traffic is diverted elsewhere often relocating the problem; 
(2)  Consistent opposition from the neighborhood; 
(3)  May hinder movement of emergency vehicles. 
(c)  Funding. There is no budget established or authorized by the city council for traffic calming. Full or partial funding by HOA or neighborhood may expedite projects. Ultimately, funding is subject to approval by the city council.

Secs. 78-31-78-42. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 78-43. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to regulate fees and charges for stormwater utility services, define the scope of responsibility, establish an enterprise fund, credit and appeal policies, billing and collection policies, and other policies and procedures related to establishing the stormwater utility. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-44. - Findings. 
    The city council makes the following findings: 
(1)  The Federal Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasize the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater management programs which address water quality impacts of storm water runoff. 
(2)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the city. 
(3)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare and the environment. Providing stormwater management services, systems, and facilities renders both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the city. 
(4)  The area of impervious surface on each parcel is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each parcel is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a stormwater service charge. 
(5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas. 
(6)  Stormwater runoff is associated with all developed properties, whether residential or non-residential, and the impacts of runoff from individual properties are directly related to the amount of impervious surface on a property. 
(7)  A dedicated funding mechanism in the city, dedicated specifically for generating consistent, stable and adequate revenue to fund stormwater management services, will ensure that the City of Holly Springs has resources available to address stormwater issues as they arise. 
(8)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city limits of the City of Holly Springs. While specific service and facility demands vary from location to location, a service area that encompasses all lands and water bodies within the geographic limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(9)  The city is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community as well as the environment and finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and the community at large and the environment to proceed with the development, implementation, and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the city budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith. 
(10)  Considering these findings, the city council finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities, and the city council finds that a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-45. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply to this article. All other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 
    Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater utility manager in accordance with the stormwater utility credit policy. 
    Customer means all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed. 
    Detached dwelling unit means developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by other than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
    Developed land means real property which has been altered from its "natural" state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued. 
    Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the statistical average impervious surface area of a detached single-family residential property within the city. An ERU will be determined through professional analysis and will be adopted by city council with resolution from time to time. This unit may be used in the rate study evaluation to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the Holly Springs Stormwater Utility. An alternative unit of measure for impervious surface may be used for the rate structure. The methodology and basis for the stormwater service charge will be adopted by city council with resolution from time to time. 
    Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
    Impervious surfaces mean those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious surfaces" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; gravel surfaces; compacted soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
    Parcel means a designated parcel, tract, or area of land established by plat, subdivision, or as otherwise permitted by law, to be separately owned, used, developed, or built upon. 
    Private stormwater management system means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality which are not public. 
    Public stormwater management system means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, public streets, curbs and gutters, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence either the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality, which are either owned by the city or over which the city has accepted an offer of dedication of an easement or other legally binding permanent right of use for stormwater drainage, and for which the city has the obligation of maintenance for stormwater drainage purposes. 
    Service charges mean the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the city. The charge shall be used to fund the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Stormwater service charges shall be based on the relative contribution of each parcel to the demand for stormwater management services, shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. The cost of operating expenses, capital investments and reserve accounts may be included in the stormwater service charges. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
    Single-family residential means a developed lot containing one dwelling structure with its principal use being a residential dwelling. 
    Stormwater management system means any one or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets; collection, or drainage. 
    Stormwater utility manager means the city manager or his/her appointee that has direct responsibility for the management of the city stormwater utility. The stormwater utility manager will report to the public works director. 
    Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or gravel surfaces or structures in excess of 200 square feet which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-46. - Establishment of a stormwater utility and enterprise fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility within the city which shall be responsible for providing stormwater management services throughout the city limits. 
(b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the Holly Springs Stormwater Utility, including, but not limited to, rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses, as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the Holly Springs Stormwater Utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund, and all expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund (i.e. from state and federal grants, bonds, revenue bonds, etc.) may be applied to stormwater management services as deemed appropriate by the city council. 
(c)  The city may pledge all or any portion of all income and revenue of any nature derived from the operation of the stormwater management systems and facilities owned by the city or owned by another political subdivision of the State of Georgia and leased to the city, including periodic stormwater service charges and other charges for stormwater service, to the payment of principal of premium, if any, and interest on any revenue bonds or other obligations lawfully issued or otherwise contracted for by the city for stormwater management services, systems, and facilities as may be provided in any resolution authorizing such bonds or obligations or in any trust instrument relating to such bonds or obligations. 
(d)  An annual audit of the stormwater enterprise fund will be conducted to ensure that funds are properly accounted for and spent on all stormwater, operational, administrative, and capital expenses as specified in subsections 78-46(a), (b), and (c) and section 78-47. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-47. - Scope of responsibility. 
(a)  The stormwater utility shall monitor the design, operation, maintenance, inspection, construction, and use of all stormwater management systems in the city. The stormwater utility shall be responsible for the design and construction of public stormwater facilities owned by the city and shall inspect, operate, and maintain them as prescribed herein. The stormwater utility shall provide services which relate to the: 
  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the City of Holly Springs; 
  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing city owned stormwater management systems; 
  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
  Maintenance and/or improvement of water quality in waterways throughout the City of Holly Springs; 
  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems; 
  Complying with the federal and state regulations related to stormwater management including the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD) watershed management requirements; and 
  Education of the public regarding stormwater issues. 
(b)  The stormwater utility shall be responsible for plan approval and construction inspection of both private stormwater systems and public stormwater systems not owned by the city. Design and construction of public or private stormwater management facilities will be governed by the criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. Additionally, the stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of private stormwater systems only when such services have been agreed to, contracted for, and approved by city council. 
(c)  The stormwater utility shall provide for inspection of private stormwater systems to ascertain that the stormwater systems are functioning as designed and approved. Property owners who fail to maintain their stormwater systems will be notified of the violation. If within 30 days (or 24 hours if there is an immediate danger to public safety), no actions are taken, the city may enter the property and correct the failure. The cost for the repair work may be billed to the owner. 
(d)  The city owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
(1)  Within public road rights-of-way and easements; 
(2)  On public land which is owned by the city, or other governmental entity, and to which the city has agreements for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system; 
(3)  On private property but within easements granted to and accepted by the city, or are otherwise permitted to be located on such private property by written agreements for rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions; 
(4)  Operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management systems which are located on private or public property not owned by the city, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to the city for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management systems, shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the laws of the state and the United States; and 
(5)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city has expressly reserved the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its directors, and employees arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
(e)  The stormwater utility shall provide for effective management of a uniform stormwater plan and program throughout the City of Holly Springs and provide compliance with the municipal separate storm sewer system NPDES permit issued to the City of Holly Springs including but not limited to the following components: 
  Public education and outreach on stormwater issues; 
  Public involvement and participation; 
  Illicit discharge detection and elimination; 
  Post-construction stormwater management; 
  Pollution prevention; 
  Floodplain management. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-48. - User fee charges. 
    It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater programs, services and facilities. Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing programs, services and facilities and acquiring property. The cost of stormwater programs, services and facilities may include operating, capital investment, and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management requirements. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees, tolls, or licenses. 
    Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments. 
    The rate structure will be adopted by city council with resolution from time to time. In order to fully recover the cost of providing stormwater management services and systems while fairly and reasonably apportioning the cost among developed properties throughout the city, the city will conduct an evaluation of rates. 
    The service charge will be based on the amount of impervious surfaces on a particular property that is developed, while undeveloped properties will not be assessed a stormwater utility fee. Stormwater utility rates will be reviewed on an annual basis and any rate changes will be approved by the city council. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-49. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
    Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the City of Holly Springs shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in the stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. 
    Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
(1)  Undeveloped land; 
(2)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks). However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges; and 
(3)  All public road rights-of-way. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-50. - Effective date of stormwater service charges. 
    The stormwater service fee shall accrue once adopted by city council with resolution, and shall be billed annually thereafter. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec 78-51. - Credits. 
    The City of Holly Springs Stormwater Utility Services Fee Credit Manual specifies the design and performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities and services which qualify for the application of a service charge credit and how such credit shall be calculated. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the City of Holly Springs Stormwater Utility Services Fee Credit Manual. The stormwater service charge credit may be up to 100 percent of the service charge applicable to a property, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services and activities provided, operated and maintained by the property owner or owners reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
    Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned upon continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the City of Holly Springs Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Manual and/or upon continuing provision of the systems, facilities, services and activities provided, operated and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. A credit may be revoked by the city at any time for non-compliance. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1); Ord. of 10-5-09(2); Ord. of 12-17-12(2), § 1 ; Ord. No. 2013-11, § 1, 7-15-13 ) 
Sec. 78-52. - Stormwater service fee, billing, delinquencies and collections. 
(a)  The stormwater service fee may be billed at the city's sole discretion. Unpaid stormwater service fees may subject the customer to lawsuit. 
(b)  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent through the United States mail or by alternative means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, the City of Holly Springs may backbill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency due to the failure to send a bill or an under billing. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-53. - Stormwater utility inspections and enforcement. 
(a)  Every owner of developed real property located in the city, and every person who serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of developing real property located in the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, treat, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city ordinances and development regulations, and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
(b)  When the stormwater utility manager determines that a public nuisance exists, the stormwater utility manager shall send a notice of maintenance requirements by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of the property described, as their name and address are shown on the latest ad valorem tax records of the county property appraiser. This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of maintenance requirements shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the public nuisance, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private storm water system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate the nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater utility manager shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater utility manager shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors. 
Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater utility manager determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of maintenance requirements has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record. 
The notice of maintenance requirements shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: notice of maintenance requirements: name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the stormwater utility manager that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of this article; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the city to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense. 
Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of maintenance requirements, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with the city for a hearing before the stormwater utility manager to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance. 
(c)  Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of city court. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1)) 
Sec. 78-54. - Appeals. 
(a)  Any customer who believes the provisions of this article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner: 
(1)  An appeal must be filed in writing with the stormwater utility manager within 30 days of the decision that is appealed. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
(2)  The City of Holly Springs shall conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within 30 days. 
(3)  In response to an appeal Holly Springs may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this article. 
(4)  The appeal will be presented to the city council and all decisions by the city council shall be final. 
(b)  The appeal process contained in this section shall be a condition precedent to an aggrieved customer seeking judicial relief. Any decision of the city may be appealed by application for writ of certiorari in the city court, filed within 30 days of the date of service of the decision of the chief executive officer.

Springs, Georgia, Readopting and Reaffirming the Holly Springs
Zoning Ordinance
RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the City of Holly Springs (hereinafter referred to as the City) is a municipality duly formed and
existing pursuant to Georgia Law; and
WHEREAS, the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia provides for the self government of municipalities
without the necessity of action by the General Assembly, and further provides specifically for the exercise of zoning
power by a municipality; and
WHEREAS, the City of Holly Springs, Georgia acknowledges and recognizes the requirement and need to follow

3.5.4: Accessory Dwelling Units for Residential Uses and Districts.
Affordable housing and neighborhood stability are important public objectives in the
City of Holly Springs, Georgia. In recent years, accessory dwellings have become an important
method to permit families to remain in their homes by securing rental income, while at the same
time providing affordable housing for the elderly, single-person households, students,
and other types of households. Accessory dwellings are also known as carriage houses,
granny flats, or ECHO homes (an acronym for elder cottage housing
opportunities).
This section allows accessory dwelling units to provide the opportunity to develop small
dwellings designed, in particular, to meet the special housing needs of single persons and couples
of modest income. This section allows and encourages the more efficient use of the existing
housing stock to preserve historic structures and to provide an incentive for their maintenance.
Design standards are established to ensure that accessory dwelling units are located, designed,
constructed, landscaped, and decorated in such a manner that, to the maximum extent feasible,
the appearance of the principal structure remains as a single family detached dwelling. It is also
the intent of these regulations to assure that the single-family character of the property will be
maintained and that the accessory dwelling unit remains subordinate to the primary living
quarters.
3.5.4-1: Accessory Dwelling Units in Detached Buildings.

contain more than two (2) bedrooms.
35

Accessory dwelling units shall only be permitted for construction in the side or rear yard of tracts
zoned or used as residential or agricultural. Such structures shall also not be permitted in any
side yard that fronts a public street, unless adequate screening is provided, either with a solid
fence, landscaping, or a combination thereof.
3.5.4-1.4 Scale, Setbacks and Height
(A) The height of the accessory dwelling units shall not exceed the height of the principal
structure on the lot, or two stories, whichever is less. Height is calculated as defined in Article 2,
under Building Height. In cases of unusual topography or uncertainty regarding the maximum
height permitted, the Chief Building Official (CBO) shall make the final determination.
The gross floor area (GFA) of an accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed seventy-five
(75) percent of the heated gross floor area (GFA) of the principal structure, excluding garages,
patios, and basements, whether heated or unheated, to a maximum of 1,500 gross heated square
feet. The building footprint of the accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed 40 percent of the

the following standards:
It is found and declared that there exist uses and activities that have potentially serious

C. Protecting the property values of existing business developments from inappropriately

which may be located in any light industrial area if it meets all the standards for planned industrial
activities. The purpose of this district is to provide flexible use and coordinated development of
light industries, warehouse processing, sales, offices and limited service activities within a wellplanned
environment. This district should be accessible to a major arterial. A concept plan is
required before a development permit is granted to ensure compatibility of the proposed
development with the surrounding area. Districts are located in areas which do not create public
nuisances or endanger public health, safety or the general welfare (REF: Cherokee County Zoning
Ordinance, Article 7, 7.1-16).

be of earthen tones when the structure has frontage visible from properties with
residential uses.
4. All customer entrances located along the front façade, including those of neighboring
smaller tenants, shall be clearly defined and highly visible and add aesthetically pleasing
character to the buildings.
5. No loading docks, overhead service doors, or trash collection bins may be placed on, or

traffic problems that will be generated by development on the premises and which
presents reasonable solutions to those problems. The plan must be prepared by the project

approval of the preliminary site plan or the issuance of a land disturbance permit or
building permit, whichever occurs first.
8. The owner of the zoning lot shall prepare a water management plan which identifies the
water management problems that will be generated by development on the premises and
which presents reasonable solutions to those problems. The plan must be prepared by a
qualified professional engineer at no cost to the city, and it must be approved by the city
engineer prior to the approval of the preliminary site plan or the issuance of a land
disturbance permit or building permit, whichever occurs first.

sixty (60) days prior to the occupant vacating the structure. Failure to produce or
complete this plan will result in penalties in accordance with this ordinance;
3. Once the structure is vacated, owner must continue to maintain the property, including

other debris is expressly prohibited;
94
4. The big box commercial retail structure must also be maintained. The owner must replace
broken windows, paint, and continue the general repair, maintenance, and upkeep of the
interior and the exterior of the structure. Windows and doors shall not be boarded or

strategically situated landholdings while protecting the natural open space, ecological,
topographical, geological, and/or historic features which may exist, from damage which might
occur from development permitted by conventional zoning and subdivision regulations. Such
features may include but not necessarily be limited to steep slopes, soils, streams and other water
bodies, woodlands and pasturelands, wetlands, watershed lands, flood plains, historic structures or
sites, cultural features, and scenic views.

opportunity to evaluate whether the proposed development will be in harmony with the character
of the neighborhood in which the development is located.
7.1-6 To encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of
development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. This may permit buildings to be clustered or
arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale, and other
public benefits.
7.1-7 To encourage better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities, and
flexibility in design.

housing types such as detached single-family houses, two-family homes, townhouses, zero lot line
development, etc.
7.1-12 Discourage clearly incompatible land uses and prevent conflicts where such uses cannot be
physically separated by the use of buffer strips and open space, gradations in the intensity of use,
control of traffic patterns (through the arrangement of streets), the arrangement of uses in relation
to topography, and other means.
7.1-13 To facilitate more affordable and efficient housing by providing possibilities for cost
savings in infrastructure, installation costs, and energy costs through clustering of dwellings and
other structures and other means.
7.1-14 To provide a linkage to any public or private transit system within and adjacent to the
development by effective organization of uses and the orientation of pedestrian and vehicular
facilities.
7.1-15 To encourage pedestrian circulation within and adjacent to the PD development.

stability, harmony, attractiveness, order and adequate light, air and open space for dwellings and
related facilities and by consideration of arrangement of the different uses permitted in this
district.
The intent of the Traditional Neighborhood Development District is to provide flexibility in design
for the development of new neighborhoods and for the revitalization of existing neighborhoods,
which are structured upon a fine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other
public spaces.
7.9-2  Locations of TND Districts  TND districts may be located where sufficient land and
infrastructure exists or is planned for which will allow for a development that meets the standards

7.9-7 TNDs in Urbanized Areas
7.9-8 New streets, urban spaces and parks must connect to existing streets and spaces
in adjacent developments. Only in extreme circumstances, or due to special urban design
considerations, will this connectivity be waived in a small proportion of instances.
7.9-9 Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building
mass and scale, and street frontage relationships of existing buildings.
7.9-10 New buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate
compatibility by varying the massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale
and volume. Design techniques to reduce the visual perception of size and integrate larger
buildings with preexisting smaller buildings should be used at all such instances. These
include, but are not limited to the following:
Building silhouette:
pitch and scale of roof lines
Building scale: height, massing and plan configuration
139
Articulation of facade: proportion of facade elements, doorways, projections and insets; window
scale and pattern; creation of strong shadow lines as decorative elements

10% of which shall be designed as a park or pocket park. Pocket parks shall be positioned in a
manner that provides ¼ mile access to all residences.
7.9-13 Residential densities shall be compatible with particular site conditions. Densities are a
function of design compliance with the appropriate Building Type Regulations. Higher densities
may be permitted as a bonus for substantially increased areas of public open space over and above
the minimum requirement. See Section 7.10-9 for bonus density.62
7.9-14 TND Design Provisions
Neighborhood Form
7.9-15 The area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots, and open space.
7.9-16 Similar land uses shall generally front across each street. Dissimilar categories shall general
abut at rear lot lines. Comer lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe
the setback established on each fronting street.
7.9-16 Public streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots.
7.9-17 Streets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the
neighborhood and connect to existing and projected streets outside the development. Cul-de-sac
shall not exceed 250 feet in length, and must be accessed from a street providing internal or
external connectivity They shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are
permitted where topography makes a street connection impracticable. In most instances, a "close"
or "eyebrow" is preferred to a cul-de-sac. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are
acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.
7.9-18 A continuous network of rear alleys is recommended for most lots in a TND; rear alleys
must provide vehicular access to lots less than 50 feet in width.
7.9-19 Utilities shall run along alleys wherever possible.
7.9-20 TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity,
and design speed; streets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The
proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated on the submitted sketch plan. Each street type in a
62 Amended by City Council with text amendment, ORD-19-2016, 12/19/2016.
140
TND shall be separately detailed to meet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building
placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip, curb and gutter, optional
parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements
will be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and
use.
7.9-21 To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of
visual enclosure, long uninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods of
achieving this objective include: (1) a street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm
the speed and disperse the flow of (2) the vista along a street can be terminated with a significant
feature (a building, park, natural feature, public monument, a specifically designed building facade
or buildings sited to provide a visual "gateway" to an ensuing space; (3) perceived street length by
a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is bounded by a building or other
vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; (4) other traffic calming configurations
are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.
Buildings and Lots
7.9-22 All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be
provided rear alley access.
7.9-23 Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages;
build-to lines determine the width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A
minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be established on the plan along all streets
and public square frontages.
7.9-24 Building and lot types shall comply with the standards illustrated in the Appendix 7.01
7.10: Planned Development Standards and Requirements
All Planned Developments, in addition to meeting the intent of this Section, detailed in chapter 7,
7.10 of this Ordinance, shall meet the following standards and such other requirements as are set
forth with respect to each of the four (4) permitted types of Planned Developments.
7.10-1  General Standards and Requirements
a. Preservation of Features  The development shall be compatible with the existing topography
of the land and shall make the best attempt to preserve any unusual topographic or natural
features. Requests to waive this standard must be accompanied by a report indicating that the
proposed development is a significant community need that transcends the need to preserve
the topography and/or features(s).
b. Design Focus  The development shall utilize design and development features that would
not be possible by the application of lot-by-lot zoning district regulations. It must be shown
that conventional development regulations would not allow the design of the proposed
project and that the project as proposed offers features that are an improvement to
conventional zoning from a community or public perspective.
141
c. Land Disturbance  No alteration or disturbance of land in a Planned Development district
or the natural or cultural resources thereon shall be permitted until the Project Plan has
received approval from the Zoning Administrator. Any subsequent land disturbance must be
consistent with the approval granted by the Zoning Administrator.
d. Subdivision Regulation  Land within a Planned Development shall be treated in its entirety
as a subdivision and thus subject to the provisions of the City of Holly Springs Subdivision
Regulations, except as follows:
1. All Land Subdivision is included regardless of size, land use, purpose of subdivision,
or whether new streets are involved.
2. Preliminary and final plats shall follow the procedures and meet all of the requirements
of the City of Holly Springs Subdivision Ordinance which shall be supplemented by
the requirements of this Section. Wherever there is a conflict between the provisions of
the Subdivision Ordinance and this Section, the provisions of this Section shall govern.
e. Integrated Functional Design  Planned Developments must be built as a single integrated
design entity. While a PD development may be subdivided subject to the provisions of this
Section and the City of Holly Springs Subdivision Ordinance, every lot shall be contiguous
and the PD shall not be fragmented or separated by non-PD lands.
f. Interconnectivity of Land Uses/Phases  Each phase of the project shall not be isolated from
adjacent phases or land use areas. Each phase shall be served by at least one public roadway
which shall connect to all adjacent phases or land use areas. In addition, each phase or land
use area adjacent to land outside of the project boundary shall connect to such adjacent land
if such a connection is available. If one phase cannot reasonably be connected to another via
a public roadway, then a private road or drive may be required. Such a private road must be
open to the public at all times for travel to the adjacent phase area. The project must contain
a minimum of two (2) primary access points from the outside.
g. Calculation of Density  Land used for open space, common areas, and interior streets,
drives, sidewalks, and other circulation ways may be included as part of the land area used
for determining the number of dwelling units allowed, the maximum floor area, or the
amount of required land. Land characterized by buffer, floodplain, steep slopes, wetlands, or
other unbuildable or sensitive lands may not be included as part of the land area for density
calculations, except that a twenty-five percent (25%) density provision may be applied to the
buildable portion of the development. Therefore, twenty-five percent (25%) of the land area
of the unbuildable area may be added to the buildable portion of the property to increase net
density. Density is calculated for the project and for individual phases. Within modules,
density for a specific product may exceed that permitted provided that the overall density for
the phase meets the required maximum density. Stated density in Table 7.01 shall be
calculated as net density as outlined in this section.63
h. General Private Deed Covenants  The entire PD district shall be included within private
deed covenants running with the land to assure the continuance of the planned residential
development in accordance with approved plans and developments. Refer to 7.10, subsection
63 Amended by City Council with text amendment, ORD-19-2016, 12/19/2016.

a. Initial Ownership  All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by
an individual, by a corporation, or by some other legal entity. Individual properties in a
planned development may be sold after a final plat has been recorded for each phase with
the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the Planned
Development as originally approved.
b. Single Ownership and Design  Planned Developments must be built as a single integrated
design entity. The project must be under single ownership or control when the project
receives final approval. Should any part of the project be designed for ownership transfer,
this shall be so stated in the application. The management plan for the development shall
include language that ties subsequent owners of any part of the development to belong to a
management entity or association overseeing the entire PD site. A PD development may be
subdivided subject to the provisions of this Section and the City of Holly Springs Subdivision
Ordinance. However, every lot shall be contiguous and the PD shall not be separated by non-
PD lands.
c. Owner/Developer Responsibilities  Initial Owner/Developers of PD projects are responsible
for the following elements of the project:
1. Development and maintenance of general common area.

shall not lapse or be waived as a result of any subsequent change in tenancy or ownership of
said land.
e. Management Association or Governing Board  Each property owner shall become a
shareholder in the common ownership of the PD development. Ownership for the purpose of
the association can mean ownership of the land, owning a share of a condominium or
cooperative development, or commercial leasehold. Residential renters will not be granted
association membership. PD developments shall have two types of documents that relate to
governance, the deeds of ownership and the bylaws:
1. Deeds of Ownership  These documents consist of the deeds of ownership; the warranties
conveyed and described in the deed; and a list of covenants, conditions, and restrictions
143
that are conditions of ownership upon the purchasers and owners in the PD. The deeds
describe the type of property conveyed, unit of ownership of the purchaser, and property
owned and directly managed by the association. Deeds and warranties shall be conveyed
to owners from the developer or prior owners of the parcel. The developer shall convey
deeds and warranties to the association upon completion of construction of the project
and after forty percent (40%) of units of ownership in the project have been sold.
Percentage share of ownership in the association shall be determined by the percentage
of acres held by the owner compared to the development as a whole.
2. Bylaws  Consist of three (3) elements described as follows:
Association Organization  This element describes the organization including the
composition and function of the board of directors and executive officers; qualifications,
duties, and number of members of the board of directors; how often the board of directors
shall meet; whether committees or subcommittees may be established; and its decision
functions and obligations.
Association Duties  The bylaws shall require the board of directors to carry out the
duties of the association through the officers of the organization. The board may engage
the services of paid staff, volunteers, consultants, attorneys, or others to carry out
administrative and other functions of the association such as security, landscaping,
maintenance, litigation, public relations, and other duties as may be determined by the
board.
Shareholder Duties  The bylaws specify the duties and obligations of the individual
shareholders as owners and occupants of the PD. The bylaws shall list rules of behavior
and rules limiting physical changes or remodeling of buildings, structures, and lots. This
element shall provide the amount of association dues to be received from shareholders
and how such dues are set and modified. Finally, this element shall list penalties and
remedies that can be imposed on shareholders for violating the terms of the deeds and
bylaws which may include eviction and foreclosure on the unit of shareholder ownership.
7.10-3  Infrastructure Standards and Requirements

the existing street and sidewalk infrastructure of the city.
2. The provision and/or design of streets is subject to review by the City Engineer which may
require or allow modifications to the location, layout, or capacity of roads or attach
additional requirements such as turn lanes, traffic circles, wider or narrower rights-of-way,
144
pavement widths, medians, traffic calming or other associated features and provided that
such modifications meet generally accepted traffic engineering and planning principals that
can be justified by the applicant and/or verified by the City Engineer. The full cost of City
review of the proposed modifications by a consulting traffic engineer shall be borne by the
applicant.
3. Public roads, road extensions, or other similar infrastructure shall be provided according
to the approved plan. Deviation from plans shall require a revised development plan.
4. All major roadways and other transportation infrastructure serving a Planned Development
must be completed and publicly dedicated prior to any building permits being issued.
d. Sidewalks  Sidewalks shall be provided according to the requirements as specified in the
Sidewalk Requirements Ordinance within the City of Holly Springs Code of Ordinances and
may be required by the Planning Commission for other purposes.
e. Parking:
1. Parking Requirements  All parking requirements shall be derived from the proposed uses
making up the project plan. Each use shall determine its share of required parking. Moreover,
spaces calculated for residential units, commercial uses, and other permanent spaces shall be
physically separated and dedicated exclusively for that use.
2. Shared Parking  A shared parking plan meeting the requirements of Article 11 and Article
20 of this Ordinance may be submitted with the phase or site plan for approval.
3. Location of Parking  Unless physically impossible, all parking for PD developments shall
be located to the rear, a combination of side and rear, or underground.
4. Illumination of Parking  All parking areas shall be illuminated so as to provide appropriate
visibility and security during hours of darkness using technology and fixtures that will not
create a nuisance to other uses within the PD development nor to uses adjacent or nearby the
PD development.
5. Utilities  All utility lines in a PD project shall be placed underground except that adaptive
reuse developments may have this provision waived upon a finding by City staff that such
requirement would require the replacement or relocation of existing lines at a cost prohibitive
to the economic rehabilitation of the building or site. The developer or subdivider shall
ensure final and proper completion and installation of utility lines as provided in the
subdivision regulations. Standards for street lighting shall be provided by the developer in
accordance with the approved site plan.
7.10-4  Landscaping Standards and Requirements
Minimum standards for landscaping in PD developments are necessary to ensure that higher
standards of site planning are realized and to tie the separate elements of the mixed-use development
together.
145
a. A landscape plan meeting the requirements of the City of Holly Springs landscape requirements
as specified in the Tree Preservation and Landscaping Ordinance within the City of Holly
Springs Code of Ordinances must be submitted as part of a new or revised Project Plan. This can
be a separate plan or may be integrated with the Site Development Plan requirements as part of
the Project Plan submittal. If the project is phased, only the submitted phase will be required to
be provided in detail but calculations and proposed plant materials and treatments must be
provided for the entire development.
b. Entry points to the development shall be landscaped in an attractive manner using plant
specimens utilized throughout the remainder of the development.

7.10-5  Open Space Standards and Requirements
Common open space is an important element in a mixed-use development serving to provide resting
and gathering places, recreation areas, aesthetic complements, storm water percolation areas, and
other purposes. Open space for the purpose of the PD district shall be defined as a portion of a lot or
other area of land associated with and adjacent to a building or group of buildings in relation to
which it serves to provide light and air, scenic, recreational, resting, or similar purposes. Such space
shall, in general, be available for entry and use by the occupants of the building(s) with which it is
associated. Open space may include a limited proportion of space so located and treated as to
enhance the amenity of development by providing landscaping features, screening or buffering for
the occupants or adjacent landowners, or a general appearance of openness. Open space (not
including unbuildable lands such as steep slopes, wetlands, flood plain, and the like or buffer area)
will be fully credited toward net density. For every such acre of open space set aside, the number of
units which could have been developed on this open space may be assigned to the remaining
buildable portion of the property thereby increasing net density for this area.64
c. General Open Space Requirements:
1. PD developments shall provide a minimum of thirty percent (30%) impervious surface for
the overall project area. This may vary from phase to phase but shall be a minimum for the
project as a whole.
64 Amended by City Council with text amendment, ORD-19-2016, 12/19/2016.
146
2. PD developments shall have an overall maximum building coverage of fifty percent (50%).
Specific land use types may vary.

developments except as provided in this Section or reduced under the provision of
subsection (b) below. Each phase of the development shall meet the following
requirements:
Each phase shall contain a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) open space; or
Each phase shall contain a minimum of seven and one-half percent (7.5%) open space that
the phase be directly adjoining other common open space of at least one (1) acre in size either
within another phase of the PD development or outside of the PD development altogether
provided that such open space is available for use and enjoyment by the residents or users of
the phase in question; or
Each phase shall contain a minimum of ten percent (l0%) open space provided that the phase
have direct and uninterrupted pedestrian access to common open space of at least one-acre
in size within a distance of no more than 1,500 feet.
4. Open space shall include: parks, commons, plazas, community green or lawn, landscaped
buffers or other areas, decorative plantings, formal or informal gardens, pedestrian
walkways or paths, and active or passive recreation areas.
5. No more than forty percent (40%) of required open space may be landscaped area.
6. Not more than forty percent (40%) of required open space may lie in a floodplain,
groundwater recharge area, wetland, steep slope area, or other un-developable area.
7. Landscaped open space shall be provided by the developer in accordance with an approved
landscape plan that meets the minimum requirements of the Tree Preservation and
Landscaping Ordinance within the City of Holly Springs Code of Ordinances.
8. A minimum of one-third (1/3) of required common open space shall be maintained as
parkland provided that:
Such lands identified for parkland are found acceptable with respect to size, shape,
topography, maintenance requirements, or other factor affecting the suitability of the land
as parkland or open space.
Dedication may be in one (l) or more parcels conveniently located to the residents of the
development.
9. Open space shall not consist of required buffer area, streets, parking lots, driveways, loading
areas, sidewalks located in the public right-of-way (except as may be internal to a dedicated
park), and area normally inaccessible to pedestrian circulation.
147
10. Open space shall also not consist of unimproved or vacant land that does not provide any
natural or man-made amenity. This shall include but not be limited to abandoned or
overgrown lawn area, scrub land or urban fields, eroded areas or areas of exposed soil, or
other land area that, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator or their designee, does not
have any functional or aesthetic use as open space.
b. Reduction of Required Open Space:
1. Adjacent Public Open Space
The minimum amount of open space required for a PD development may be reduced by a
maximum of thirty five percent (35%) if the PD site bounds, along at least one property
line for a minimum of 100 feet, public open space with a minimum area of ten (10)
square feet for every one-hundred (100) square feet of the PD site and including a park,
playground, plaza, garden, or other open space available for and accessible to public use

7.10-6 - Residential Standards and Requirements
a. General Residential Requirements
1. Maximum Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit  Density of dwelling units may be applied to a
specific module or may be average for the entire development based on the sum of permitted
units allowed by individual zoning areas within the development area divided by the
developable residential land area of the development.
b. Single-Family Housing
Single-family housing in a PD development may consist of the following:
1. Standard large lot single-family detached residences.
2. Cluster residences.
148
3. Zero lot line residences.
c. Multi-Family Housing
Multi-family housing in a PD development may be in the form of:
1. Fee Simple Townhouses
2. Fee Simple Condominiums
3. Loft style apartments above retail storefronts
Development requirements for multi-family housing include:
1. Safety and Security  Multi Family structures shall be designed in such a manner as to
provide a safe and secure environment for residents. This shall include, at a minimum,
secured entrances to residential areas.
2. Entrances Separated  Common residential building entrances shall be physically separated
and distinct from commercial or other non-residential building entrances.
3. Noise - Residential units shall be constructed so that interior noise levels are not excessive
or constitute a nuisance.
4. Storage of Refuse  Residential units shall maintain a separate refuse storage container from
that used by non-residential uses. It shall be clearly marked for residential use only and use
by non-residential tenants is strictly prohibited.
7.10-7 - Non-Residential Standards and Requirements
a. Location of Commercial Phases or Uses  General commercial and service uses shall be
concentrated for maximum pedestrian convenience and located for easy accessibility by
residents of the district, workers within the district, and visitors. It is highly preferable
that commercial uses maintain a street presence in a traditional storefront configuration.
Other acceptable locations include an arcade, interior mall, or in the lobby of a building
containing other allowable uses. Strip commercial with front parking is generally not
acceptable.
b. Maximum Floor Area Ratio  Floor Area Ratios (FAR) for non-residential uses may be
applied to a specific phase or may be averaged for the entire development based on the
sum of permitted floor area allowed by individual zoning areas within the development
area divided by the developable non-residential land area of the development.
c. Common Walls  Common walls between residential and non-residential uses should be
constructed so as to minimize the transmission of noise and vibration.
d. Nuisances  No commercial use shall be designed or operated so as to expose residents to
offensive odors, dust, electrical interference, and or vibration.
e. Limitation of Hours and Activity  Commercial uses shall be designed and operated, and
hours of operation limited where appropriate, so that neighboring residents are not
149
exposed to offensive noise, especially from traffic and late-night activity. In addition, no
amplified music shall be audible to neighboring residents.
f. Outdoor Lighting  All outdoor lighting associated with commercial uses shall be
designed so as not to adversely impact surrounding residential uses, while also providing
a sufficient level of illumination for access and security purposes. Such lighting shall not
be directed toward residential units and shall not allow lighting blink, flash, oscillate, or
be of unusual brightness or intensity.
g. Finishing Materials  Non-residential PD development shall utilize masonry or
decorative wood exterior finishing materials for, at a minimum, the front and sides of the
building. If the rear of the building faces a public street or road, this side shall utilize a
masonry or decorative wood exterior finish as well. Acceptable masonry finishing
materials include brick, stucco, natural or cultured stone, decorative concrete, or terrazzo
tile. Unfinished concrete, cinder block, metal panels, plywood, masonite, and vinyl siding
are not acceptable finishes.
7.10-8  Compatibility Standards and Requirements:
All uses shall conform to the purposes of the PD district and shall be compatible with all uses,
existing or proposed, in the vicinity of the area covered by the proposed PD development. In order
to assist in accomplishing such external compatibility, the following requirements shall apply:
a. No buildings other than single-family detached dwellings shall be constructed within
seventy-five (75) feet of adjoining property that is developed with single-family detached
dwellings unless the Zoning Administrator finds that topographical or development features
permit a lesser setback. However, in no case shall the setback be less than thirty-five (35)
feet.
b. No building shall be constructed to a height greater than its distance from any adjoining
property designated for residential use on development plan, unless the Zoning Administrator
finds that approval of a waiver of this requirement will not adversely affect the adjacent
property.
c. Relation to Residentially Developed Property Lying Outside of PD District  The sides, rear
or front of a lot developed for retail sales and services or multi-family dwellings shall neither
abut nor lie across the street from property lying inside or outside the PD district that has
been developed with single-family dwellings.
d. Compatibility With Surrounding Public Improvements  PD developments must provide
public improvements that are compatible in design and function to those of surrounding and
adjacent properties. Improvements such as sidewalks, street lighting, trash receptacles, street
furniture, and other public elements shall be compatible unless this provision is waived by
the Planning Commission based on a conclusion that the proposed improvements are an
improvement over the existing adjacent improvements.
150
e. Effect on Neighboring Properties  The development shall not in any way negatively effect
developed or undeveloped neighboring properties.
7.10-9  Bonus Density Calculations
Residential densities shall be compatible with particular site conditions. Densities are a function
of design compliance with the appropriate Building Type Regulations. Higher densities may be
permitted as a bonus for substantially increased areas of public open space over and above the
minimum requirement. Bonus density shall be allowed as follows, if it is determined at the time
of Planned Development district approval, for the density to be compatible with the surrounding
area:
a. For each additional 5% of open space added to the project, the planned development
district shall receive a bonus density of 5%.
b. Bonus density shall be limited to a maximum of 25% regardless of the amount of
additional open space provided.65
7.11: Application Procedures and Requirements
Applications for amendments to existing Planned Development districts shall follow the procedures
outlined in this Section. PD projects have four (4) distinct elements:
7.11-1 Project Plan  The project plan is the plan for the development of the entire Planned
Development. The project plan shall identify the specific phases that the project will consist of all
proposed general circulation transportation facilities, land uses and proposed densities (net density),
and open spaces and natural site features to be preserved between phase locations. If only one (l)
phase is proposed, the project must combine the requirements of the project and phase plans into
one submittal. Proposed major streets and other circulation infrastructure along major corridors
including sidewalks must be clearly indicated on the plan. The applicant or developer of the PD is
solely responsible for the provision of major transportation facilities regardless of property
disposition. Such facilities must either be developed prior to approval of any Phase Plan or a bond
for one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the estimated cost of such infrastructure must be provided
to the city prior to the approval of any Phase Plan. Building permits shall not be issued for any lot
or parcel that is not located on a dedicated or developmental public street or road.
The project plan shall consist of a professionally designed schematic plan indicating the layout of
the development. Two (2) complete sets of the project plan shall be submitted to the Planning &
Zoning Department; nine (9) copies of each graphic in 11 X 17 format; and two (2) color
renderings of the plan on 36 X 48 clay coat or similar heavy duty paper. This plan shall contain
the following elements:
Project Plan Elements
 Identify the boundary of the project property;
65 Amended by City Council with text amendment, ORD-19-2016, 12/19/2016.
151
 Provide a delineation of phases (if applicable);
 Indicate total project site area and area by type of land use (i.e. residential, commercial,
industrial, office, open space, utilities and right-of-way, other).
 Indicate proposed land uses including square footage or acreage and percentage of each
component;
 Indicate the number of residential units and/or square footage of non-residential floor area
by type (i.e. commercial, industrial, office);
 Indicate the density (net density) of uses within each land use component or phase using
units per acre for residential uses and floor area ratio (FAR) for non-residential components;
 Show a proposed vehicular and pedestrian circulation plan including entrances and exits and
connections to vehicular and pedestrian facilities external to the project property. The project
must have a reasonable mix of public and private roadways to maximize circulation
efficiency;
 Show existing natural features of the site including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, wetlands,
steep slopes, mature trees and tree stands, and other natural features;
 Show where proposed open space will be provided by type of open space  landscaped area,
community green, plaza, formal or informal garden, natural area set aside. Indicate proposed
square footage or acreage and percentage of open space as a part of total project. Also,
indicate where publicly dedicated open space will be provided; and
 Indicate location of landscaping and buffers. 66
In addition, the applicant shall provide a completed rezoning application and a cover letter
requesting review of the project plan that shall include a written narrative describing how the
proposed project meets the purposes of the Planned Development district as provided in Chapter
7, 7.1, of this Ordinance and the purpose statement of the specified district(s) requested. The
project plan shall be reviewed by staff and discussed in an informal meeting with the applicant to
examine potential areas of non-conformity. Staff, upon review of the plan, will determine
whether the project meets the intent of the district and includes the required elements. If the
project does not meet with the intent or lacks required elements, staff may reject the project plan.
However, should the plan meet the intent and contain the required elements, staff will accept the
project plan and provide the applicant with suggestions for changes and modifications, if any,
that will prepare the applicant for the submittal of phase plans. While the applicant may ask for
more than one project plan review, at least one review is mandatory.
7.11-2 Phase Plan  The phase plan shall serve as the preliminary plat for a specific phase, pod,
module, or land use designation of the project. Most Planned Developments will consist of a project
plan identifying a number of areas of the site with unique or individual land use types. Each of these
areas, if developed separately, will require separate preliminary and final plat approval. Phase plans
must be consistent with the project plan or the project plan must be revised and approved by the
City. Phase plans must show lot subdivision, if proposed; internal site circulation within the phase
or land use area; specific open space set aside; as well as the requirements for phase plans that are
provided below.
After the Project plan has been formally reviewed and accepted by staff and the basic plan concept
has been found acceptable, the applicant shall submit a plan for the improvement of a specific phase

or nonresidential establishment who is competent to translate the foreign words.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the use of foreign words or characters

unconstitutionally obscene language or advertise an illegal activity. This section is adopted in
order to aid in the identification of businesses and other commercial establishments in the
City, for police, fire, and other emergency responses, and to avoid confusion and delay in
response to such emergencies and to protect the public health, morals and welfare from the
display of unconstitutionally obscene language and the advertisement of illegal activities.

public streets.
B. Ensure that off-street parking, loading, and access associated with new development will be
met without adversely affecting other nearby land uses, future or present.
C. Provide a safe and efficient transportation system that is consistent with environmental goals,
clean air, and protection from natural elements of sun and wind with proper landscaping.
D. Make applicable sense to the transportation needs of Holly Springs, Cherokee County, and the
region by allowing flexibility in vehicle parking, loading, and access issues.
11.1-2 Applicability
A. The provisions in this article apply to any provision, removal, enlargement, or alteration of any
off-street parking space or loading berth accessory to any building or structure existing as of
the effective date of this Ordinance or any new space or berth required to be provided under
this ordinance.
B. Off-street parking or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served and which were in existence on the effective date of this ordinance or were provided
voluntarily after such effective date, shall not be reduced below, or if already less than, shall
not further be reduced below the requirements of this Ordinance for a similar new building or
use.
C. If said building or structure was erected prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, additional
parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for
the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to the parking
and loading provisions of this Ordinance.
11.1-3 Access  Each required off-street parking space and loading berth shall open directly upon
an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide a safe and efficient thoroughfare in a

lot on which the principal use is conducted, the Zoning Administrator may permit such space to
be provided on other off-street property through the administrative variance process (Article 15).
Such vehicular parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be
reduced or encroached upon in any manner. Said parking will be congruent with landscaping and
buffers requirements of principal use.

right-of-way shall follow the nuisance regulations as defined within The Code of the
City of Holly Springs.
11.2-7Within Mixed-Use (MXD) developments, shared parking is required and should follow the
general guidelines in sections 20.08 and 20.10 of this ordinance.
11.3: Shared Parking Standards - The required parking spaces for any number of separate uses
may be combined in one lot based on the following standards.
A. General. The Zoning Administrator may approve shared use of parking facilities located on
separate properties if:
201
1. A convenient pedestrian connection between the properties exists;
2. The properties are within 500 feet of each other;
3. Property owner or owners submits shared parking site plan with application to include
spaces intended to be shared and proximity to uses, signage plan for drivers direction, and
pedestrian circulation plan that shows required connections and walkways between uses
and parking areas.
B. Number of Spaces Required.
1. Where the uses to be served by shared parking do not overlap their hours of operation,
property owner or owners provide the number of parking spaces equal to the greater of the
applicable individual parking requirements;
2. Where the uses to be served by shared parking have overlapping hours of operation, the
property owner or owners shall provide parking stalls equal to the total of the individual
parking requirements with a 10 percent reduction if the following criteria are met:
a. The parking areas share a property line;
b. A vehicular connection between the lots exists;
c. A convenient, visible pedestrian connection between the lots exists;
d. The availability of parking for all affected properties is indicated by directional signs.
C. Documentation Required. Prior to establishing shared use of parking, the property owner or
owners shall file with City of Holly Springs Building Department a written agreement
approved by the Zoning Administrator providing for the shared parking use. The agreement
shall be recorded on the title records of each affected property.

204
11.4: Parking Design Standards  A parking plan for all but single-family residential uses shall
be submitted when a building permit is applied for. The plan shall incorporate the following
parking design standards:
11.4-1 - All parking facilities, including entrances, exits, and maneuvering areas, shall comply
with the following provisions:
A. Shall have access to a public street.
B. Shall be graded and paved including access drive(s) and be curbed when needed for effective
drainage control.
C. Shall have all spaces marked with paint lines, curb stones or other similar designations.
D. Each space shall have not less than one hundred sixty-two (162) square feet and shall be not
less than nine (9) feet wide and eighteen (18) feet deep, exclusive of passageways and shall
have a 24-foot back-up space except where parking is angled. There shall be adequate interior
drives to connect each space with a public street. In cases of twenty- five (25) or more required
parking spaces, twenty five percent (25%) of the required spaces may be of an area not less
than eight feet x sixteen feet (8 x 16).
E. Shall be drained so as to prevent damage to abutting property or public streets.
F. If a parking area is established within a residential district for a nonresidential use permitted in
a district zoned for residential use, a continuous visual buffer at least four (4) feet in height
between the parking area and the abutting residential property shall be provided on a strip of
land at least ten (10) feet wide adjoining the lot used for residential purposes that is reserved
as open space, and planted in grass, shrubs, and trees.
11.5: Landscaping Standards  Parking lots should be effectively landscaped with trees and
shrubs to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and parking lot lights from the public rightof-
way and from adjoining properties. In addition, parking lots should be adequately shaded to
reduce the amount of reflected heat. Landscaping is vital in maintaining a positive level of urban
tree coverage, which has benefits of slowing stormwater runoff while improving air and water
quality.
11.5-1 - Buffer Adjacent to Street Right-of-Way  A buffer shall be provided between off-street
parking areas and any adjacent public street, walk, or right-of-way as follows:
A. Buffer Strip Requirements  For a parking lot with less than twenty spaces, a minimum five
(5) foot buffer strip around the perimeter of the lot is required.
For a parking lot with twenty spaces or more, a minimum ten (10) foot buffer strip around the
perimeter is required.
205
B. Exception When a proposed development abuts a property which is in a different zone district
and a landscaped buffer is required according to provisions of Section 9.3., the parking buffer
shall be waived.
C. Screening Standards  Screening Standards shall comply with the provisions as set
forth in Section 9.8.
11.5-2 - Landscaping in Interior Areas  Landscaping areas shall be provided for interior
vehicular use areas so as to provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of pavement
and to channelize and define logical areas for pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
A. The following are the requirements for interior landscaping areas:
B. Canopy trees with grass, ground cover or low shrubs are the primary landscape material within
parking lots. Tall shrubs or low-branching trees that will restrict visibility are not permitted.
C. Interior landscaped areas shall be dispersed so as to define aisles and limit unbroken rows of
parking.
D. Planting islands shall be a minimum of nine (9) feet wide and shall be located between every
ten (10) to fifteen (15) spaces to avoid long rows of parked cars. Each of these planting islands
shall provide at least one (1) canopy tree and have a clear trunk height of six (6) feet.
E. The interior landscaping areas shall contain sufficient canopy trees. For every twelve (12)
parking spaces, at least one tree not less than two and one half (2.5) inches caliper at a height
of thirty-six (36) inches is required. Trees can be either evergreen or deciduous.
F. If the specific application of the interior landscape requirements will seriously limit functions
of the building site, the Zoning Administrator/Clerk shall have authority to permit
consolidation and relocation of these landscaped areas on the building site.
11.6: Off-Street Loading Regulations
11.6-1 Location
A. All required loading berths shall be located on the same lot as the use served, except when
collectively provided as central loading facilities.
B. No loading berth for vehicles over two (2) ton capacity shall be closer than fifty (50) feet to
any property in a residential district unless enclosed by building walls.
Number of Spaces Minimum % of

206
C. No permitted or required loading berth shall be located within twenty-five (25) feet of the
nearest point of intersection of any two streets.
D. No loading berth shall be located in required side yard, and any loading berth located so as to
hinder the free movement of vehicles or pedestrians over a street, sidewalk, or alley.
11.6-2 Repair, Service, and Maintenance  No motor vehicle repair work or service of any
vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies shall be permitted in conjunction with loading facilities
provided in any residential or business district. Off-street loading areas shall be maintained in a
clean, orderly condition at the expense of the owner or lessee.
11.6-3 Use of Loading Berth  Space allocated to any off-street loading berth shall not be used
to satisfy the space requirements for any off-street parking facilities or portion thereof.
11.6-4 Size  Unless otherwise specified, a required loading berth shall be at least twelve (12) feet
in width by at least forty (40) feet in length, inclusive of aisle and maneuvering space, and shall
have a vertical clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet.
11.6-5 Surfacing  All open off-street loading berths shall be surfaced with a dustless all-weather
erosion-resistant material capable of bearing a live load of two hundred (200) pounds per square

ARTICLE 12: NON-CONFORMING USES82
12.1: Intent
12.1-1Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted
there may exist:
(A) lots;
(B) structures;
(C) uses of land and structures; and
(D) characteristics of use
which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended but which would be prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this article or such amendment. It is the intent of this
Ordinance to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that non-conformities shall not
be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
12.1-2 Non-conforming uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land,
or a non-conforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this Ordinance. Attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended
to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be
prohibited generally in the district involved.
12.1-3 To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in
the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendment thereto and upon
which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be
deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
12.2: Non-Conforming Uses of Land
Where at the time of passage of this Ordinance or any amendments hereto, lawful use of land exists
that would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance of such amendments,
and where such use involves no individual structure, the use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, provided:
12.2-1 No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, not extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of this Ordinance or such amendments.
82 Amended by City Council with text amendment, 08/21/2006
209
12.2-2 No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or
parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of this article or any amendments
hereto.
12.2-3 If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than
thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the regulations specified by this
Ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
12.2-4 No additional non-conforming structure shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming
use of land.
12.3: Non-Conforming Structures  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance
that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
12.3-1 No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its
non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its non-conformity.
12.3-2 Should such non-conforming or non-conforming portion of a structure be destroyed by
any means to an extent of more than fifty one percent (51%) of its replacement cost at time of
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this article.
12.3-3 Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
12.4: Non-Conforming Uses of Structures and Premises in Combination
If lawful use involving individual structures with an appraised cost exceeding one thousand dollars
($1,000), or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of this article or
any amendment hereto, that would be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
12.4-1 No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance or such amendment,
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved,
or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district
in which it is located.
12.4-2 Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building that were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this Ordinance or such
amendment, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
210
12.4-3 If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a structure, or structure
and premises, may as a special exception be changed to another non-conforming use provided that
the Planning & Zoning Commission, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 15.3-3, Special
Exceptions and Interpretations, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case,
shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the
existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, appropriate conditions and safeguards
may be required in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.83
12.4-4 Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-conforming use
is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and
the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
12.4-5 Where a non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination,
removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-conforming status of the land.
Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty
one percent (51%) of the replacement cost at time of destruction.
12.5: Discontinuance of Non-Conforming Uses or Structures  When a non-conforming use
of a structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive
months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period (except when government
action impeded access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination,
shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which is
located.
12.6: Repairs and Maintenance
12.6-1 On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming
use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on
repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not
exceeding fifty one percent (51%) of the current replacement cost of the non-conforming structure
or non-conforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content
existing when it became non-conforming shall not be increased.
12.6-2 If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use
becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by
any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
12.6-3 Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening of, or restoring to a
safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with
protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
83 Amended by City Council with text amendment ORD-21-2016, 12/19/2016.

12.7: Non-Conforming Use Regulations for Conditional Uses
(A) The purpose of this section is to apply certain protections to property owners whose property
is properly zoned and used by a business operating with a valid conditional use permit or is
classified as a legally nonconforming conditional use establishment. Without this section,
when a business requiring a conditional use permit ceases to operate, the property owner is
required to have any new business obtain a conditional use permit before operating a
business with the same conditional use on said property.
(B) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1) The term conditional use means uses in the respective zoning district, which upon
application to and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission and favorable
decision thereon by the Governing Authority, may be permitted and a conditional use
permit issued; or businesses or uses classified as legally nonconforming.
(2) The term legally nonconforming means legitimately operating in the City while noncompliant
with the current code due to predating the code(s).
(3) The term property owner means persons, companies, corporations, partnerships or other business
entities that own property within a zone designated as commercial by the City.
(4) The term business operating with a valid conditional use permit means any company,
corporation, partnership or other business entity located in a commercial zone of the City with
meets all of the following conditions:
a) The business, if of a type commonly registered with the Office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Georgia must be currently registered and in good standing, or the
business, if not of a type commonly registered with the Office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Georgia must maintain on file with the City evidence of the type
of business entity they are operating; and
b) The business must have a valid and current occupational tax license issued by the
City; and
c) The business must have a valid and current conditional use permit issued by the City
or fall under the exception granted by this section.
(5) The term ceases to operate shall mean a business that meets one or more of the following
conditions:
a) Where the interior area of the business structure is designated as patron or retail space
meant for public use and more than 70 percent of that area has not been continuously
occupied by said use for a period of 30 days or more; or
b) Where the exterior areas and grounds of the business structure constitute necessary
and customary use in the conduct of the business, and more than 70 percent of that
area has not been continuously occupied by said use for a period of 30 days or more;
or
c) The City declares the business to be non-existing, deemed abandoned or out of
business and notifies the property owner; or
212
d) The occupational tax license for the business has expired; or
e) The conditional use permit for the business has expired.
(6) The term same conditional use means a business that operates in such a manner as to require a
conditional use permit from the City that is identical to the type of conditional use permit required
by the previous business that is deemed to have ceased to operate.
(C)All property owners whose property is zoned for and used by a business operating with a
valid and current conditional use permit, or a conditional use business classified as legally
nonconforming shall have a maximum of ninety (90) days from the date that business ceases
to operate to use said property for a new business with the same conditional use without the
new business having to obtain a conditional use or other special operating permit from the
City. After the 90-day period expires, any nonconforming property and/or business must
come in full conformance with all relevant zoning.

ARTICLE 15: VARIANCES, APPEALS, AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS91 92
15.1: Intent.  The intent of this Article is to establish minimum procedures for the
approval/denial process of variances, appeals, and special exception applications. The minimum
procedures are designed to assure that due process is afforded the general public when the City
regulates the use of property.
15.2: Planning & Zoning Commission. The Planning & Zoning Commission (Commission)
shall hear and decide the matters set forth in this Article, pursuant to the provisions and
procedures specified below.
15.3: Variances, Appeals, and Special Exceptions
15.3-1 Variances. The Commission shall hear and decide applications for variances from the
development requirements of this Ordinance, but only where by reason for exceptional
narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, which at the time of adoption
of this Ordinance, was a lot or plat of record; or where by reasons of exceptional topographic
conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict
application of the said development requirements of this Ordinance would result in practical
difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of such property. The Commission may also
consider variance requests from the Development Regulations of the City of Holly Springs. In
granting a variance, the Commission may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable
so that the purpose of this Ordinance will be served; however, the Commission shall not be
authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the
use is prohibited. No variance shall be authorized unless the Commission finds that all of the
following conditions exist:
1. That the special circumstances or conditions applying to the building, structure or land in
question are peculiar to such premises and do not apply generally to other building, structures
or land in the vicinity.
2. That the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
property right and not merely to serve as a convenience to the applicant.
3. Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special
privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is
located.
4. That the condition from which relief or a variance is sought did not result from willful action
by the applicant.
91 Amended by City Council with text amendment,08/21/2006, 01/22/2009; Formerly known as the Zoning Board
of Appeals
92 Amended by City Council with text amendment ORD-21-2016, 12/19/2016.
227
5. The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the
land, building or structure.
6. The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures which is not
permitted by right in the district involved.
7. That the authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, increase the
danger of fire, imperil the public safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the health, safety,
comfort, morals or general welfare of the inhabitants of the City.
15.3-2 Appeals. The Commission shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the
appellant that there is an error in any order, requirements, development or building permit,
decisions, fines issued, determinations, or refusal made by the Zoning Administrator or other
administrative official in the administration or enforcement of any provision of this Ordinance.
Such appeals shall be in accordance with the following procedures:
1. An appeal to the Commission may be taken by any person, firm or corporation aggrieved, or
by any governmental officer, department, board or agency affected by any decision of the
Zoning Administrator or City Engineer with respect to this Ordinance. Such appeal shall be
made within ten (10) days following notification of the decision appealed from, by filing
with the Zoning Administrator a notice of appeal and specifying the grounds therefor. Once
an appeal is officially filed and fees are paid, the Zoning Administrator will docket the case
on the Commission agenda.
2. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the
Zoning Administrator certifies to the Commission, after the notice of appeal shall have been
filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certification a stay would, in the Zoning
Administrators opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property, in which case proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
3. The appellant and any public agency or private individual shall be entitled to present
evidence on matters before the Commission.
4. The Commission may, in conformity with this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,

18.1 General.
In order to maintain and promote the public health, safety and welfare, the City has established
regulations governing the conservation planting and replacement of trees. It is the City's intent to
prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of
real property. The importance of trees is recognized for their contribution toward quality of life. It
is also the intent of these regulations that all applicable sites within the City maintain or obtain
minimum tree density, as defined herein. Consistent with the expressed purpose of these
regulations, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, selfsupporting
trees as defined herein. Each person shall be responsible for the normal care of trees
located on its premises.
A. Willful injury or disfigurement of any tree growing within the City shall be a violation of
this Ordinance.
B. No person shall:
1. Attach any sign, notice or other object to any tree or fasten wires, cables, nails or screws
to any tree in a manner that could prove harmful to the tree, except as necessary in
conjunction with activities in the public interest.
2. Pour any material on any tree or on nearby ground which could be harmful to the tree.
3. Cause or encourage any unnecessary fire or burning near or around any tree.
4. Construct a concrete, asphalt, brick or gravel sidewalk, significantly compact the soil,
place fill material, or create other impervious or semi-impervious surfaces around any
tree so as to cut off air, light or water from the roots of the tree so as to adversely impact
the tree's root system.
5. Pile building material or equipment around any tree so as to cause injury thereto.
6. Deny routine maintenance, watering and reasonable arboricultural care to existing and
newly established trees as may be required as a result of activities taking place under
this Section.
7. Remove any tree without an Approval Letter (Permit) from the Director.
8. Remove or prune a tree on commercial property during non-development activity
unless they follow ISA industry standard protocols from pruning or have written
approval from the Director.

EXAMPLE: The CRZ radius of a twenty (20) inch diameter tree is twenty-six (26) feet.
Density Factor. A unit of measure used to prescribe the calculated tree coverage on a site.
Development Activity. Any alteration of the natural environment, which requires the approval of
a development or site plan and issuance of a Land Disturbance Permit. By way of illustration but
not limitation, Development Activity shall also include the "thinning" or removal of trees from
land in conjunction with a forest management program, the removal or destruction of trees
incidental to the development of land or to the marketing of land for development, the removal or
destruction of trees in conjunction with any grading activity, including the removal or filling
(stockpiling) of soil, and logging or the removal of trees not in conjunction with an ongoing forest
management program. Nothing in this definition shall be deemed to require or authorize the
issuance of a permit for any activity described herein.

preservation or planting of trees on a 'For-Sale' residential subdivision lot. Plantable Area shall not
include that portion of the lot that is covered by buildings and structures permitted pursuant to the
maximum lot coverage standards of this Ordinance.
Replacement Planting. The planting of trees on a site that before development had more trees, and
after development shall have less trees per acre.
Responsible Party. Any individual, firm, principal, or other entity who is a signatory to a Tree
Removal Permit Application or Land Disturbance Permit for Development Activity or any person
or company caught in the act of tree removal without a City-issued permit, or who violates any

life or property;
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees.
18.4 Approval Letter Required for Non-Development Activity (Activity Which Does Not
Require a Building Permit, Etc.).
A. Except for routine or seasonal pruning or transplanting of trees, and except as exempted,
no person shall engage in any Non-Development Activity as defined without first obtaining
an approval letter. The request for an approval letter shall be submitted to the Director and
shall be, unless waived by the Director, in the form of a brief written narrative stating the
reason for the proposed work and either a site sketch or photograph of the tree(s) proposed
to be removed, identifying such tree(s) by size and species. If the application is complete,
complies with the Ordinance, and requests tree removal for one of the purposes identified
in Paragraph B. below, the Director shall issue an approval letter not later than ten (10)
working days from receipt of a complete request, and shall inform applicant if replanting
will be required. If application is incomplete or denied, the Director shall notify applicant
in writing regarding the specific reason for denial.
B. The Director shall issue an approval letter for the following:
1. The removal of dead, substantially injured, damaged or diseased trees;
2. The removal of any non-specimen tree, provided the applicable minimum tree density
requirement is maintained.
18.5 Land Disturbance Permit for Development Activity.
A. No person shall engage in a Development Activity and no Land Disturbance Permit shall
be issued without first obtaining an approved site plan stamped and signed by the Director.
B. Except as provided in Paragraph (c) of this subsection, no tree removal shall be approved
for any site not under active development. For the purposes of this Ordinance, a site is not
under active development unless there exists an approved development plan delineating
the improvements to be constructed on the site consistent with the use for which the site is
zoned, and there is a reasonable certainty that construction is imminent.
C. A Land Disturbance Permit may be issued for Grading Activity on a site not under active
development provided that:
238
1. The sole purpose of the Grading Activity is for the storage, removal or altering of soil
for fill balancing on another site under active development;
2. The site not under active development must be under common ownership or common
development control with the site that is under active development;
3. The site not under active development must be contiguous to, or located within one (1)
mile of, the site under active development. For the purposes of this Section, the
measurement of distances shall be from property line to property line along the most
direct route of travel on a public road;
4. The proposed Grading Activity shall not result in the damage or removal of more than
ten percent (10%) of the total tree density units (as defined in Tables B.2 and B.3 of
Appendix B, Minimum Tree Density Requirements) on the site not under active
development;
5. The proposed Grading Activity shall not decrease the tree density below the minimum
tree density for the site. For the purposes of this Section, trees in Buffers that will be
required shall be excluded from minimum density calculations;
6. The area to be disturbed within the site shall be the area that will have the least adverse
impact on existing trees, as determined by the Director. In addition, the area must be
visually screened from public roads, developed residential and commercial properties,
by a one hundred-foot (100') buffer or a buffer of sufficient depth to provide reasonable
visual screening. In order to provide reasonable visual screening, it may be necessary
to locate access roads to the impacted area in a winding manner to prevent a straight
line of site to the impacted area; and
7. The disturbed area within the site shall be replanted with trees to a tree density of twenty
(20) units per acre no later than eighteen (18) months from the issuance of the Land
Disturbance Permit authorizing the Grading Activities. A tree replacement plan and a
bond shall be submitted and approved by the Director prior to the issuance of the permit
authorizing the Grading Activities. The bond shall be held for one (1) year and to the
end of the succeeding Planting Season to ensure survival of the replacement trees. The
applicant shall be responsible for the irrigation (watering) of trees during the period of
the bond. The replanting requirements of this Section shall not apply, and the bond
shall be released, if, on or before fifteen (15) months from the issuance of the permit
authorizing the Grading Activity, the site becomes under active development pursuant
to the issuance of a Land Disturbance Permit and the approval of development plans in
compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
D. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to authorize any Grading Activity or similar
activity not otherwise in compliance with the Development Regulations of the City of
Holly Springs, including, the Soil, Sedimentation, and Pollution Control Ordinance.
Further, nothing in this Section shall be deemed to eliminate the requirement that all
reasonable efforts must be taken to save and not adversely impact the Critical Root Zones
of Specimen Trees and that all applicable sites from the City shall maintain or obtain the
minimum tree density required by this Ordinance.
239
18.6 Application Requirements.
A. When a person applies for a Land Disturbance Permit as defined herein, such person shall
also file an application providing the following information:
1. A complete tree survey and inventory, as described in subsection 18.8;
2. An integrated site plan showing Specimen Trees, the trees to be saved and those to be
removed, utilities to be installed, grading, the approximate location of all structures,
driveways and curb cuts and proposed tree plantings and other landscaping;
3. A detailed plan to protect and preserve trees before, during and for a period of two (2)
years after construction, which plan shall contain the following information:
a. All items found on the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Submittal checklist
pertinent to normal plan review;
b. Site area (roads, utility lines, detention ponds, etc.);
c. The locations of existing and proposed structures, paving, driveways, cut and fill
areas, detention areas, etc.;
d. Phase lines or limits of construction;
e. A delineation of all protected zones with any required dimensions;
f. Calculations showing compliance with the required Site Density Factor using
existing trees, replacement trees, and/or contributions to the City of Holly Springs
Tree Replacement Fund (see Density Factor Analysis, Appendix B, Table B.2);
g. Locations of all existing and proposed utility lines and easements;
h. Locations of any boring sites for underground utilities;
i. Locations of all Specimen Trees and indications whether they are to be removed or
preserved;
j. Locations of all tree protection devices, materials to be used in each location and
details;
k. A delineation of tree-save areas in which trees have been inventoried for density
calculations;
l. If applicable, locations and details of all permanent tree protection measures (tree
wells, aeration systems, permeable paving, retaining walls, bollards, etc.); and
m. Additional information as required on a case-by-case basis.
The above items may be integrated into the normal application requirements and
submittals.
B. Minor additions to existing development require only a sketch showing changes to be
submitted to the Director for review and approval.
240
18.7 Minimum Tree Density Requirement.
A. All sites within the City other than 'For-Sale' residential lots shall maintain a Minimum
Tree Density of twenty (20) units per acre. All sites within the City other than 'For-Sale'
residential lots shall maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre. The term "unit"
is an expression of basal area as defined herein and is not synonymous with "tree". The
density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to
development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved,
planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this Ordinance, or some
combination of the two. Minimum tree density shall be calculated and established pursuant
to the formula and analysis set forth in Appendix B to this Ordinance. The developer shall
be subject to the minimum tree density requirement set forth in this paragraph, but the
developer shall base its density calculations on the net site area excluding the acreage
required for Buffers and infrastructure improvements (roads, utility lines, detention ponds,
etc.). In no event shall a parking lot be considered an infrastructure improvement.
B. All newly constructed 'For-Sale' residential lots in the City shall maintain a minimum tree
density based upon the maximum number of trees that can be maintained within thirty
percent (30%) of the lot's plantable area, taking into consideration the standards established
in this Ordinance for tree size and separation. The density requirement must be met whether
or not the individual lot had trees prior to development. The density requirement is
calculated by determining lot size and deducting the impervious area, assigning the
necessary root zone for trees (400 sq. ft. for Overstory trees and 200 sq. ft. for Understory
trees). All 'For-Sale' residential lots constructed prior to the effective date of this Ordinance
are required to maintain the requirements of this Section at a twenty percent (20%) level,
rather than the thirty percent (30%) requirement used for new construction.
C. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees
according to the minimum standards of this Ordinance, or some combination of the two.
In addition, replanting on such lots shall be at a ratio of not less than one (1) Overstory tree
(minimum two-inch (2?) caliper) for every three (3) Understory trees (minimum one-inch
(1?) caliper). No more than thirty percent (30%) of any one genus may be included in any
replanting plan.
D. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save
Specimen trees. (Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building
design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, water retention
location and the like). Developers shall receive a density credit of two (2) times the
assigned unit value for each Specimen Tree saved by utilizing an alternate design.
Specimen trees that cannot be saved must be replaced with trees having a total density
equal three (3) times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch (4?) tree
caliper. Specimen Trees removed without prior approval shall be replaced with trees equal
to eight (8) times the unit value with a minimum four-inch (4?) tree caliper and subject to
the applicable penalties as described in Section 18.19.
E. The intent of these Regulations is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained
on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will
not bear the required density of trees. To provide some alternatives in such cases, two
alternative methods of compliance may, at the discretion of the Director, be approved:
241
planting at a location remote from the project site; or, contributing to the City of Holly
Springs Tree Replacement Fund.
1. The following standards have been established for administering these alternative
compliance methods. The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative
compliance. In no instance, shall 100% of the required site density be met through
alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must
be planted on the site in question.
2. No permit shall be issued until the Director has approved the request and received the
necessary documentation and/or funds. If trees are to be planted at another location, the
off-site location should be in the same area of the City as the project site and a tree
replacement plan meeting all applicable standards must be reviewed and approved by
the City Manager or his designee.
3. Where the proposed development area is so dense that the minimum Site Density Factor
cannot reasonably be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing
parking spaces in excess of the minimum number of spaces required by zoning, placing
additional planting islands within the development area, or reducing the area to be
occupied by buildings. Where these methods are not feasible or are ineffective, the
developer may make application to participate in the Tree Replacement Fund. A
minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required density must be met on the
development site in order to make application. The developer may contribute towards
the Tree Replacement Fund in an amount not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
required density based on the caliper size of trees pursuant to the City of Holly Springs
Municipal Services Master Fee Schedule.
4. One hundred percent (100%) of the required density must be met through either
providing the density on the development site or through a combination of providing
the required density on the development site and participating in the Tree Replacement
fund. Funds contributed to the Tree Replacement Fund may be used by the City to
purchase and install trees in the citys public areas, to include parks, green spaces,
rights-of-way, and government building sites.
18.8 Tree Survey Plan and Inventory.
A. A tree survey shall be provided in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan prepared and
sealed by a registered surveyor or registered engineer, noting the location of all trees within
the area to be modified from its natural state and twenty-five feet (25') beyond in each
direction.
B. All Specimen Trees and all trees that are to be counted toward meeting density
requirements must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size (Caliper or DBH,
whichever is applicable) and species. Sampling methods may be used to determine tree
densities for forested areas (over five (5) acres). Specimen Trees must be shown on the
plan with an indication whether they are to be retained or removed. All Tree Protection
Zones and Tree Save Areas must be delineated on the plan. All Buffers with existing trees
must be delineated on plans as Tree Save Areas. Land disturbance within any Buffer is
subject to Planning Department approval.
242
18.9 Tree Survey Inspection.
Following the receipt of the completed tree removal application and supporting data, the Director
shall schedule and conduct an inspection of the proposed development site. The applicant or his
designee shall be advised as to the date and time of the inspection and given an opportunity to
participate. Following inspection, the Director shall advise the applicant of any recommended
changes in the applicant's proposed tree removal, protection or replanting plans necessary to make
the plans comply with the provisions of this Ordinance.
18.10 Tree Removal Approval Applications.
A. The Director shall review all applications and supporting data and take one (1) of the
following actions: approve, approve with conditions or disapprove. Applications, which
meet the requirements of this Ordinance, shall be approved.
B. Development Activity will not be authorized until such time as appropriate Land
Disturbance Permits have been issued and approval granted.
C. Tree removal and replacement shall begin no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after
issuance of the permit and shall be completed no later than two (2) years after the issuance
of the permit, except as provided in these regulations authorizing certain cut and fill
activities. The Director may refuse to issue any permit for tree removal until the submission
of all development plans and receipt of other evidence satisfactory to the Director that there
is a reasonable certainty that the Development is imminent.
18.11 Tree conservation standards.
Prior to any tree removal or commencement of construction on a site and continuing until a final
subdivision plat has been recorded or a certificate of occupancy has been issued, the following
system shall be used:
A. Location and Types of Tree Protection Devices.
1. Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the plan or otherwise completely
surrounding the Critical Root Zone of all trees to be preserved.
2. The plan shall indicate whether the tree protection device is to be active or passive.
3. Active protection (see B. Materials subsection) is required where Tree Save Areas are
located in proximity to construction activity.
4. Passive protection (see B. Materials subsection) may be used in more remote locations
and in all protected zones not designated as Tree Save Areas.
5. The locations of all tree protection devices will be verified prior to the issuance of the
construction permit for clearing and/or grading.
243
6. Once Protected Zones are established and approved, any changes are subject to
Community Development Department review.
B. Materials.
1. Active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post
and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing, where
tree trunks are in jeopardy of being damaged by equipment, the Director shall require
2-inch by 4-inch boards to be strapped around the trunks of trees. In addition, where
active tree protection is required, each tree to be saved shall be marked at the base of
the trunk with blue colored water-based paint.
2. Passive protection shall consist of heavy mil. plastic flagging, a minimum of 4 inches
wide with dark letters on a bright background reading "Tree Protection AreaDo Not
Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint.
C. Sequence of Installation and Removal.
All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any land disturbance permit
authorizing tree removal. The Community Development Department must inspect the
installation of tree protection and erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to the
issuance of the land disturbance permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning
condition until the certificate of occupancy is issued.
18.12 Tree Protection.
A. The cleaning of equipment, storage of materials or dirt, disposal of waste material such as
paint, oil solvents or other harmful substances, or any other such act which may be harmful
to the continued vitality of the tree(s) within the tree protection area, is prohibited.
B. Prior to commencement of any grading, construction or tree removal authorized through
the issuance of a land disturbance permit, a Tree Protection Area for any tree located within
25 feet of any proposed grading, construction or tree removal must be established by
physical barriers and maintained until such work is completed.
18.13 Tree damage.
Any tree designated in the plan to be saved that is damaged during construction, or as a result of
such construction, shall be treated according to accepted current Tree Care Industry Association
(TCIA) ANSI Standard 300, or replaced with a tree(s) equal to the unit value of the tree removed.
However, any Specimen Tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with a tree(s) eight
(8) times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch (4?) tree Caliper. In the
event that a damaged specimen tree must be removed, the location occupied by the tree's Critical
Root Zone must remain in a pervious state with no structures or buildings placed in this area and
violations shall be subject to the applicable penalties as described herein. Any specimen tree
damaged on "For-Sale" residential lots as the result of failure to receive tree removal approval for
non-construction tree removal or as a result of failure to protect a specimen tree during nonconstruction
tree removal will result in up to three (3) times recompense.
244
18.14 Tree replanting standards.
A. Unless otherwise approved by the Director, trees selected for replanting must be on the
Tree Planting List. Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease,
nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a
reasonable expectation of survivability. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with
those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication Tree and Shrub
Transplanting Manual or similar publication. Reference the American Horticulture
publication American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1, 2014) for plant material
quality standards. Reference the Manual of Woody Landscape Plants (Michael Dirr, 1983,
Castle Books) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements.
B. It is desirable that replanted trees be ecologically compatible with the site and neighboring
sites. Accordingly, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those
removed when practical.
C. All replanted overstory trees shall be at least six (6) feet tall and have a trunk of not less
than two (2) caliper inches. All replanted understory trees shall be at least four (4) feet tall
or have a trunk not less than one (1) caliper inch. In order to provide sufficient growing
area for planted trees, the following minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise
approved by the Director.
1. Overstory trees200 square feet of pervious root zone.
2. Understory trees75 square feet of pervious root zone. (However, up to 30% of root
zone may be impervious area.)
18.15 Tree Removal Compliance Inspection.
A. Following the issuance of a Land Disturbance Permit for the development site, the Director
shall from time to time inspect the site for the purpose of certifying compliance with the
requirements of the tree removal. In the event of non-compliance, the Director may revoke
or modify any City permit pertaining to the Development Activity for which the Land
Disturbance Permit has been issued. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until actual
compliance is obtained.
B. If any required Land Disturbance Permit conditions have not been met within the time
specified in the Land Disturbance Permit and provided the Director has not granted a
written extension, the City may use the cash or bond proceeds to ensure that these
conditions are met. The bond will have an expiration date no longer than one (1) year, and
the proceeds will go to the City of Holly Springs Tree Replacement Fund.
C. After development is complete, the Director shall continue to make random inspections to
ensure that required trees are maintained. Replacement shall be required, or bond/letter of
credit posted within thirty (30) days of notice by the Director should any of these trees die,
be removed or be destroyed within two (2) years after completion of development.
245
D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance to the contrary, a home builder's
responsibility to replace a newly planted tree or trees shall terminate upon the issuance of
a certificate of occupancy provided that an inspection conducted immediately prior to the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy confirms that the replanted tree or trees were
planted properly as established in the ISA (International Society of Arboriculture)
standards, and are healthy and free of pests and disease. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be
deemed to eliminate any other obligation the homebuilder may have pursuant to any private
agreement between the homebuilder and homeowner, or any restrictive covenants that are
applicable to the property.
18.16 Permit Fee.
The fee for review and issuance of a tree removal shall be as listed in the City of Holly Springs
Municipal Services Master Fee Schedule. These fees may be revised from time to time by
resolution of the City Council.
18.17 Enforcement, Appeals and Variances.
A. Enforcement.
All applications for tree removal shall initially be submitted to and reviewed by the City
Arborist. The City Arborist shall be responsible for recommending to the Community
Development Director the approval or denial of applications for Land Disturbance Permits.
B. Appeals.
1. Written requests for appeal of any administrative decision must be submitted to the
Community Development Department within ten (10) days after notice of such
decision. Such written request can be appealed through the appeal process of Article
15, Variances, Appeals, and Special Exceptions.

3. Variances that exceed ten percent (10%) or variances that exceed the allowance of
administrative variances shall be heard by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
246
4. Variances can be granted only in the case of extreme hardship or unusual circumstance.
The factors to be taken into consideration by the Planning Commission may include
the following:
a. The ease with which the applicant can alter or revise the proposed development or
improvement to accommodate existing trees.
b. The economic hardship that would be imposed upon the applicant if the variance
was denied.
c. The heightened desirability of preserving tree cover in densely developed or
densely populated areas.

to be damaging or injurious to trees.
g. Whether the removal of the trees is for the purpose of thinning a heavily wooded
area where some trees will remain.
h. Whether tree removal would have an adverse impact upon existing biological and
ecological systems.
i. Whether tree removal would affect noise pollution by increasing source noise levels
to such a degree that a public nuisance may be anticipated or a violation of the noise
control ordinance will occur.
j. Whether the general health and life expectancy of the tree or trees warrant the
measures necessary to prolong the life of the trees based upon accepted ISA
practices.
D. Appeal from the Decisions of the Planning Commission shall be through the appeal process
of Article 15, Variances, Appeals, and Special Exceptions, Section 15.5, Appeals to City
Council.

100 Amended by City Council with text amendment, ORD-10-2015, 09/28/2015.
250
19.4: Purpose and Applicability. The intent in establishing these model districts is to set forth
design guidelines for buildings, sites, and streetscapes upon existing zoned properties. The
purpose of the design guidelines is to regulate site planning, landscaping, and exterior architectural
design in order to:
(a) Protect and maintain the value of existing buildings and property.
(b) Protect public investment by mitigating impacts generated by new development and significant
redevelopment on existing public facilities and utilities.
(c) Minimize any adverse impacts of new development and significant redevelopment on existing
buildings and property through provision of screening, buffering, landscaping, and other
techniques.
(d) Promote architectural harmony between structures within each specific model zoning district
as well as the City as a whole.
(e) Improve upon the aesthetic qualities of Holly Springs.
(f) Lessen traffic congestion, minimize traffic safety problems, and promote the use of alternative
modes of transportation, such as walking and bicycling.
(g) Enhance economic opportunities in Holly Springs by developing architectural and site
development themes attractive to prospective quality developers, businesses, and residents.
19.4-1 These guidelines will be applied in reviewing projects as they relate to overall design and
architecture and represent but a portion of the overall development review conducted by the City
of Holly Springs. The laws, ordinances, and regulations of the City are not negated by these review
guidelines. All other Articles and Sections of this Holly Springs Zoning Ordinance as well as the
Holly Springs Development Regulations combine with this Article 19 to form the basis for all
development in Holly Springs. These guidelines will be used in addition to all other requirements
of this Ordinance and the Citys Development Regulations. If any guideline contained herein
Article 19 is in conflict with other Articles and Sections of this Ordinance, the Development
Regulations, or any other law, ordinance, or regulation of the City of Holly Springs, the more
restrictive regulation shall apply.
19.4-2 A design plan, processed and approved in accordance with Section 19.5 below, shall be
required before a building permit or other permit, as appropriate, is issued or before any land
disturbance or building-related activities occur for all non-single-family structures and uses within
the corporate limits of Holly Springs. The requirements of this Article shall also apply to
subdivisions of property for the purpose of building three (3) or more single-family homes where
noted herein.
19.4-3 The requirements of this Article shall apply to all applications for building permits
submitted after the effective date of the adoption of said Article by the City Council. The
251
architectural, landscape, and streetscape provisions of this Article shall not be triggered by
standard maintenance activities requiring neither a building nor land disturbance permit.
19.4-4 Additionally, the requirements of this Article, including the submission of a design plan,
shall be met in the event that an existing business ceases to operate in a commercial or light
industrial district and remains inactive for a period of ninety (90) days, before the City can issue a
business license/occupational tax certificate and allow a new business to operate in that location.
19.5: Application and Review Process. In the event that an applicant for development within a
model zoning district needs an amendment to the Official Zoning Map in order to use property in
a manner not allowed under the existing zoning classification, then the review process described
in this section shall begin with the filing of an application for zoning amendment in accordance
with Article 14 of this Ordinance. If an applicant for development within a model zoning district
is seeking a land use that is inconsistent with or prohibited within that model zoning district, then
the review process described in this section shall begin with the filing of an application for an
amendment in accordance with Article 14 of this Ordinance. Otherwise, the model zoning district
review process shall run concurrent with the Citys Plan Review Process. In no case shall a land
development permit or a building permit be issued by the City of Holly Springs within a modelzoning
district unless and until the project has been brought through the design review process
described in this section. Said design review process shall be in addition to all other review
requirements prescribed in this Ordinance and the Holly Springs Development Regulations.101
19.5-1 Applicants for the design review process are encouraged to meet with the Zoning
Administrator prior to the filing of a design plan to ensure maximum understanding of and
compliance with the Citys zoning, development, and design requirements. Failure to do so will
likely result in unnecessary processing delays, rejections, and re-submittals. The City shall not be
responsible for delays in the review process caused by:
(a) an applicants lack of familiarity or understanding of the design plan requirements;
(b) omission of required design plan information and/or exhibits; and
(c) failure to comply with the requirements of this Article, as well as the remainder of the Holly
Springs Zoning Ordinance and the Holly Springs Development Regulations;
(d) failure to comply with the requirements of other applicable review agencies, including the
Cherokee County Water & Sewer Authority, the Cherokee County Fire Marshals Office, the
Cherokee County Environmental Health Department, and the Limestone Valley Soil & Water
Conservation District.
19.5-2 If an applicant for the design review process is also seeking an amendment to the Official
Zoning Map, then the design plan shall be submitted at the time the zoning amendment application
is submitted, in accordance with Article 14 of this Ordinance and the schedule established by the
Zoning Administrator for processing such applications. In such a case the design plan becomes
101 Amended by City Council with text amendment, TA-05-2013, 01/06/2014
252
part of the zoning amendment application and shall be subject to the review, scrutiny, and
approval/disapproval of the Planning & Zoning Commission and the City Council.
19.5-3 If an applicant for the design review process does not need an amendment to the Official
Zoning Map, then the design plan shall be submitted along with all other plans, exhibits, narratives,
and other required information into the Citys established Plan Review Process, and shall be
subject to the review, scrutiny, and approval/disapproval of the City staff and the other review
agencies, where applicable, mentioned in Section 19.5-1 above. Generally, this process takes five
(5) to ten (10) business days for completion, notwithstanding delays caused by the reasons listed
in Section 19.5-1 above.
19.5-4 Should an applicant for the design review process as identified in Section 19.5-3 above
disagree with the staffs application of the design guidelines contained herein, or desire a waiver
of one or more of the guidelines, said applicant may appeal the staffs decision or make a waiver
request to the Planning & Zoning Commission. Requests for appeals and waivers shall be made
on forms prescribed by the Zoning Administrator and processed in accordance with the same
schedule established for processing zoning map amendments and all other requirements for
processing zoning map amendments specified in Article 14 of this Ordinance, except that the
Planning & Zoning Commission shall render a decision on the applicants appeal or waiver request
as opposed to making a recommendation to the City Council.
In considering a waiver request, the Planning & Zoning Commission shall make any decision for
approval based on the following physical considerations:
(a) the waiver is reasonable in light of the projects size, location, layout, topography, or other
geographic feature;
(b) the waiver will not result in any adverse impact on other properties in the applicable model
zoning district; and
(c) the waiver will not result in any adverse impact on the Citys application of the design
guidelines to other properties in the applicable model-zoning district.
The Planning & Zoning Commission shall not consider economic factors in its deliberation of a
waiver request, except as those economic factors may be associated with the above listed physical
considerations.
Should the applicant or any other interested party disagree with the Planning & Zoning
Commissions decision on a staff appeal or waiver request, said applicant or any other interested
party may request an appeal of the Commissions decision to the City Council. An appeal to the
City Council shall constitute a separate action, including the filing of a separate appeal application.
In other words, upon the rendering of an undesired decision by the Planning & Zoning
Commission, the applicant or any other interested party cannot assume that the case will then be
forwarded to the City Council. A specific request must be made to the City Council appealing the
Planning & Zoning Commissions decision on forms prescribed by the Zoning Administrator. For
the purposes of this section, any other interested party shall be defined as any property owner
253
within 500 feet of the subject property and within the corporate limits of the City of Holly Springs
or within the contiguous platted subdivision of the subject property.102
19.5-5 Upon approval of the design plan and subsequent issuance of a building permit, all exterior
architectural design and landscaping and other on-site improvements shall be completed in
accordance with the approved design plan. The building inspector shall make periodic field
inspections as required. Where a violation is found to exist, the building inspector shall issue a
Stop Work Order, and direct the project owner/developer to correct the violation. The building
inspector shall charge a re-inspection fee in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by the City
Council upon notification by the project owner/developer that corrections necessary for lifting the
Stop Work Order have been performed and that a re-inspection can be made.
An appeal of the building inspectors action may be made to the Zoning Administrator. Any
determination by the Zoning Administrator to override the action of the building inspector shall
be made in writing, with specific reasons stated as to why the building inspectors action was
inappropriate. If the Zoning Administrator upholds the building inspectors action, an appeal of
the Zoning Administrators decision may be made to the City Council on forms prescribed by the
Zoning Administrator. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the building inspector unless
all on-site improvements, landscaping, and exterior building façade are completed in accordance
with the approved design plan.
19.5-6 Approval of a design plan submitted under provisions of this Article shall expire one year
after the date of approval unless a land development permit has been obtained. For the purposes
of this Article, a land development permit shall expire six (6) months after the date of issuance
unless a building permit has been obtained. In accordance with the Citys Building Codes
Administration Ordinance, a building permit shall expire six (6) months after the date of issuance
if no requests for building inspections have been made. The Zoning Administrator may grant a
six (6) month extension on the land development permit upon making a written determination that
said extension is in the best interest of the City and will not result in any noncompliance with the
requirements of this Article or other ordinances and regulations of the City. Likewise, the building
inspector may grant a six (6) month extension on the building permit upon making a written
determination that said extension is in the best interest of the City and will not result in any
noncompliance with the requirements of this Article or other ordinances and regulations of the
City.
19.6: Design Plan Requirements. All design plans submitted for consideration in the above
described application and review process shall contain a site plan, landscape plan, and architectural
elevations drawn to an appropriate scale sufficient for reviewing parties to easily identify
significant site and building features. Plans shall be prepared by a licensed architect, landscape
architect, engineer, or land surveyor, and shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
(a) Date, boundary survey, approximate scale and north arrow.
(b) Contours for existing topography and elevations at intervals appropriate to the project.
102 Amended by City Council with test amendment, TA-05-2013, 01/06/2014.
254
(c) Identification of all significant man-made and natural features and an indication of all such
features to be retained, moved, or altered.
(d) If the design plans are being processed with a request for zoning map amendment for approval
by the Planning & Zoning Commission and City Council, then preliminary plans/proposals for
grading, drainage, storm water management, and soil erosion and sediment control are
required. If the design plans are being processed in accordance with the Citys established
Plan Review Process, then final plans for those items and all site improvements required under
the Citys Development Regulations and this Zoning Ordinance must be provided.
(e) Identification of all proposed site improvements including internal circulation and parking,
streetscapes, lighting, building locations, sign locations, accessory use locations, and other
proposed amenities.
(f) Identification of and adherence to all landscaping, buffers, and tree protection measures
required by this Article as well as Articles 7, 9, 11, and 18 of this Ordinance.
(g) Scaled elevation drawings of proposed structures and signs, including information on finishing
materials and colors.
19.7: Holly Springs Town Center District.103,104 New commercial development and
redevelopment within the Holly Springs Town Center District (TCD) is intended to be
characterized by attractive storefronts, benches, sidewalks, street lamps, and landscaping, with
structures situated closer to the street and parking relegated to the sides and rear. Proposed new
construction, renovations, or redevelopment to residential, commercial or industrial structures in

19.8: Holly Springs Parkway District Requirements. As with the Town Center District, new
commercial development and redevelopment within the Holly Springs Parkway District is
intended to be characterized by attractive storefronts, benches, sidewalks, street lamps, and
landscaping, with structures situated closer to the street and parking relegated to the sides and rear.
Recognizing that the Holly Springs Parkway corridor represents the most viable location in the
City for large-scale commercial development, such as shopping centers and office parks, some
provisions have been made to allow for flexibility when dealing with said development.
The Holly Springs Parkway District is intended to generate quality commercial, office, and mixeduse
developments in a pattern reminiscent of nineteenth and early-twentieth century architecture.
The regulations recognize the existence of residential uses within this district, especially along the
western side of Holly Springs Parkway, and incorporate screening standards that shall remain in
place for new development and redevelopment adjoining these residential uses, for as long as said
residential uses exist in compliance with this Ordinance and other regulations of the City.
19.8-1 Streetscape Requirements for Small Projects. The front setback line of all new structures
in the Parkway District with less than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area, including strip-style
commercial or office centers, shall be twenty (20) feet but also allow for future expansion of Holly
Springs Parkway to be widened. The streetscape of the Parkway District for structures of this size
shall incorporate an alternative transportation zone, and an optional front yard zone. A
sidewalk shall be installed the entire width of the alternative transportation zone.
The features of the two zones shall be as follows:
(a) Alternative Transportation Zone  A minimum 10-ft. wide concrete sidewalk, located adjacent
to the road right-of-way, shall constitute the required alternative transportation zone for all
property lying on the east side of Holly Springs Parkway. In the event that an adjoining
property, due to existing building location or other reason, does not have a sidewalk of the
required 10-ft. width, then a gradual tapering from the 10-ft. width down to the width of said
adjoining property shall be accomplished. A minimum 5-ft. wide concrete sidewalk located
adjacent to the right-of-way for all property lying on the west side of Holly Springs Parkway
along with a 5-ft. wide landscape strip to include decorative light posts. Light posts must be
consistent throughout the district and approved by the Zoning Administrator. The alternative
transportation zone is intended solely for use as a means of getting around within the Parkway
District and shall be unobstructed by a permanent or nonpermanent item for a minimum width
of ten (10) feet and a minimum height of eight (8) feet.
(b) Front Yard Zone  Although optional, the use of a front yard zone is encouraged for public
plazas, terraces, and outdoor dining. Where used, the front yard zone shall be a maximum
width of ten (10) feet. The front yard zone shall be separated from the alternative
transportation zone by fencing no more than three (3) feet high, made of rock, brick, or wrought
iron.
19.8-2 Streetscape Requirements for Large Projects. Streetscape requirements for projects
involving the construction of new structures with 10,000 square feet or more of gross floor area
are as follows:
258
(a) If said structures shall have one or more out parcels situated in front of them, then said
structures shall follow normal building setback provisions of the applicable sections of this
Ordinance. The out parcels shall be required to meet the setback provisions of this Section
and contain the alternative transportation zone identified above and the optional front yard
zone if desired.
(b) If said structures shall not have out parcels situated in front of them, then said structures shall
either comply with the setback and alternative transportation zone requirements of this Section
or use the normal setback requirements of the applicable zoning classification, combined with
a ten (10) foot wide sidewalk adjacent to the right-of-way. Additionally, a front yard
landscaping area of thirty (30) feet in depth shall begin immediately adjacent to the sidewalk.
Said landscaping area shall contain a landscaped berm not less than four (4) feet in height with
trees planted on the berm every 25 feet on center. These trees shall be not less than three (3)
inches in diameter at a point twelve (12) inches above the grade. They shall be of a deciduous
species.
19.8-3 Parking Requirements for Small Projects. Parking for projects involving the construction
of new structures with less than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area, including strip-style
commercial and office centers, shall be limited to the sides and rear. The Zoning Administrator
may allow front parking only after the owner/developer has demonstrated a hardship. If front
parking is allowed an additional 5 feet must be added to the landscape strip, a four-foot brick or
stone monument wall or landscape berm to screen parking must be run along the frontage that
would include columns of the same material with a base and abacuses. Front parking will only be
allowed along the property frontage where properly screened. All parking areas shall comply with
the requirements of Article 11 of this Ordinance.
For properties making use of front areas for parking at the time of adoption of this Article, and
which are presented into the design plan review process with proposals that do not include
additional land disturbance, site improvements, and/or the erection of new structures or the
demolition and replacement of existing structuresin other words, proposals to simply renovate
or remodel an existing buildingthe front yard parking scheme may be allowed to continue.
However, in such a case, all parking area landscaping requirements specified in Article 11 of this
Ordinance, if not already adhered to, shall be met. Additionally, the installation of a ten (10) foot
wide sidewalk adjacent to the right-of-way in the existing front parking area shall be required,
where the Zoning Administrator (or Planning & Zoning Commission, in the case of a rezoning
request) determines that such installation is possible given the overall site layout, and that such
installation will not trigger noncompliance with the parking requirements of Article 11 of this
Ordinance.
Where constructed, parking decks shall conceal automobiles from visibility and should appear as
horizontal storied buildings. Where possible, decks shall accommodate street level commercial
uses on the ground floor, with parking beginning on the second floor.
19.8-4 Parking Requirements for Large Projects. Parking for projects involving the construction
of new structures with 10,000 or more square feet of gross floor area are as follows:
259

structures shall follow normal parking provisions of the applicable zoning classification as
specified in Article 11 of this Ordinance. The out parcels shall be required to meet all of the
parking provisions Section 19.8-3 above.
(b) If said structures shall not have out parcels situated in front of them, then said structure may
follow either the parking provisions of Section 19.8-3 above or the normal parking provisions
of the applicable zoning classification as specified in Article 11 of this Ordinance with an
additional 30-foot landscape strip adjacent to the alternative transportation zone.
Regardless of whether or not out parcels are present, for properties making use of front areas for
parking at the time of adoption of this Article, and which are presented into the design plan review
process with proposals that do not include additional land disturbance, site improvements, and/or
the erection of new structures or the demolition and replacement of existing structuresin other
words, proposals to simply renovate or remodel an existing buildingthe front yard parking
scheme may be allowed to continue. However, in such a case, all parking area landscaping
requirements specified in Article 11 of this Ordinance, if not already adhered to, shall be met.
Additionally, the installation of a ten (10) foot wide sidewalk adjacent to the right-of-way in the
existing front parking area shall be required, where the Zoning Administrator (or Planning &
Zoning Commission, in the case of a rezoning request) determines that such installation is possible
given the overall site layout, and that such installation will not trigger noncompliance with the
parking requirements of Article 11 of this Ordinance.
Where constructed, parking decks shall conceal automobiles from visibility and should appear as
horizontal storied buildings. Where possible, decks shall accommodate street level commercial
uses on the ground floor, with parking beginning on the second floor.

the sides and rear. Recognizing that the Hickory Road corridor represents a viable location in the
City for small to mid-scale commercial and mixed-use development that leads into the Downtown
Town Center District, such as restaurants, specialty retail shops and loft type residential units, the
standards and guidelines which follow are intended to allow flexibility for private development
while acknowledging each propertys obligation to the public realm.
The Hickory Road District is intended to generate smaller scale quality retail developments that
will service the nearby residential base via a pedestrian friendly network but also in a pattern
reminiscent of nineteenth and early-twentieth century architecture. The regulations recognize the
existence of residential uses within this district, especially above or behind retail stores that line
Hickory Road, and incorporates screening standards that shall remain in place for new
development and redevelopment adjoining these residential uses, for as long as said residential
uses exist in compliance with this Ordinance and other regulations of the City.

ft. width, then a gradual tapering from the 10-ft. width down to the width of said adjoining
property shall be accomplished. A minimum 5-ft. wide concrete sidewalk located adjacent to
the right-of-way for all property lying on the north side of Hickory Road along with a 5-ft.
wide landscape strip to include decorative light posts. Light posts must be consistent
throughout the district and approved by the Zoning Administrator. The alternative
transportation zone is intended solely for use as a means of getting around within the District
and providing a pedestrian friendly connectivity to the Downtown Town Center District.
(b) Front Yard Zone  Although optional, the use of a front yard zone is encouraged for public
plazas, terraces, and outdoor dining. Where used, the front yard zone shall be a maximum

made traditional American towns and neighborhoods convenient and attractive. In order to reestablish
walk able streets, the standards and guidelines provide for a Pedestrian-Oriented
traditional neighborhood design. New commercial development and redevelopment within the
East Residential District is intended to be characterized by attractive storefronts, benches,
sidewalks, street lamps, and landscaping, with structures situated closer to the street and parking
relegated to the sides and rear. The East Residential District represents the most viable location
in the City for detached and attached residential subdivisions with allowance for neighborhood
commercial opportunities.

include:
(a) Protect and strengthen desirable and unique physical features, design characteristics, and
recognized identity and charm;
(b) Promote and provide for economic stability;
(c) Protect and enhance the livability of the community;
(d) Continue to perpetuate the master plan to protect the built environment and areas yet to be
constructed;
(e) Reduce conflict and prevent blighting caused by incompatible and insensitive development,
and promote new compatible development;
(f) Ensure the consistency of the development and established community;
(g) Stabilize property values;
(h) Provide residents and property owners with a planning tool for future development;
(i) Encourage and strengthen civic pride;

19.12-2 Zoning Compliance, Covenants, and Consistency: The underlying property developed
into the Harmony on the Lakes at Holly Springs Master Plan Development was rezoned by the
Mayor and City Council on February 18, 2003, with Zoning Case# MA-02-03; and included a
maximum of 1,250 residential homes as well as the commercial villages component. The case
rezoned -/+ 540 acres, to Planned Development Residential (PDR) with the mixed-use overlay
(MXD-II), attaching 39 stipulations of zoning.
Subsequently, on July 21, 2003, the Mayor and City Council rezoned -/+ 118 acres to PDRMXD-
II, with Zoning Case# MA-07-03, attaching 29 stipulations of zoning. This property,
which became known as The Reserve development, with a maximum of 273 detached
residential units, was integrated into the Harmony on the Lakes at Holly Springs Master Plan
Development. The overall density of Harmony on the Lakes is 2.31 units/acre.
The regulations set forth with this overlay district are intended to supplement the underlying
zoning districts and stipulations approved for the Harmony on the Lakes at Holly Springs Master
Plan Development. Where conflicts arise between codes or previously adopted ordinances, the
regulations set forth by this district shall govern.
Additionally, the Harmony on the Lakes at Holly Springs Master Plan Development is governed
by a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions, (covenants) recorded October
28, 2004; accompanied by Design Guidelines, effective September 1, 2004. Nothing herein is
intended to contradict the covenants, design guidelines, sections, and subsections therein, as the
covenants are privately enforced and regulated. In the unusual event that a regulatory conflict
ever arises between the overlay district and the covenants, the most restrictive standard shall
govern.
19.12-3 Master Plan Implementation: With 1,523 residential units approved and commercial
opportunities available on Highway 140 and Hickory Road, construction began in 2003 to make
the Harmony on the Lakes at Holly Springs Master Plan Development a reality. In addition to
The Macauley Companies, developers and builders including Patrick Malloy Communities,
Landon, Sharp Residential Builders, Pulte, Haven, Westminster, and more, began to develop
pods, sections, and neighborhoods within the Harmony on the Lakes Subdivision, making the
master plan a reality. These areas were uniquely designed and constructed, becoming distinctive
and eclectic neighborhoods, evolving their very own respective character and personality.

ARTICLE 20: MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
20.0 General Purpose and Description
The overall purpose of the MXD, Mixed Use Overlay District, is to allow and encourage flexibility
and creativity in the design and development of comprehensively planned, mixed-use centers that
would not be possible under conventional zoning districts. It is intended that this zone provide a
more adaptable approach to the comprehensive design and development of mixed-use centers than
the procedures and regulations applicable under the various conventional zoning categories and
other planned development zones. In so doing, it is intended that this zoning category be utilized
to implement existing public plans and pertinent City policies in a manner and to a degree more
closely compatible with said City plans and policies than may be possible under other zoning
categories. The specific purposes of this zone are:
1. To encourage residential uses in conjunction with commercial and other compatible activities
in order to create an active street life, enhance the vitality of businesses, and reduce vehicular
traffic.
2. Residential, commercial, and other non-residential uses shall be provided in such a manner as
to be co-dependent, functionally integrated, and complementary of each other rather than
random, non-integrated, and non-associative elements.
3. To encourage orderly, staged development of large-scale, comprehensively planned mixed-use
developments by providing procedures for the submission of a concept plan for an entire site
and subsequent development plans for each stage of development, as identified on the concept
plan.
4. To provide, where appropriate, higher density residential uses integrated into the overall
mixed-use development.
5. To assure compatibility of the proposed land uses with surrounding uses by incorporating
higher standards of project and site planning than could be accomplished under conventional
zoning categories.
6. To strengthen the Citys economic base and to provide proximate linkages between
employment opportunities and housing.
7. To encourage and provide for open space not only for use as setbacks and yards surrounding
structures and related walkways, but also conveniently located with respect to points of
residential and commercial and/or industrial concentration so as to function for the general
benefit of the community and public at large as places for relaxation, recreation, and social
activity. It is also intended that open space and amenities be located so as to achieve the
physical and aesthetic integration of the uses and activities within each development. In
addition, structured parking within mixed-use planned developments is encouraged to help
achieve the open space and amenities objectives of the zone. Where surface parking is
293
necessary, the purposes of this zone may be achieved by the provision of additional
landscaping.
8. To encourage and provide for the development of comprehensive non-vehicular circulation
networks, separated from vehicular roadways, which constitute a system of linkages among
residential areas, open spaces, recreational areas, commercial and industrial areas and public
facilities.
9. To promote development that is compatible and complementary in design to the traditional
style of building in the City of Holly Springs and that establishes a pedestrian oriented
development.
10. To encourage and provide for efficient use of energy resources.
11. To promote the adaptive reuse of older structures for the purpose of stabilizing and improving
property values, to encourage neighborhood conservation, to foster civic pride in the beauty
and accomplishments of the past; to protect and enhance the City's attractions to tourists and
visitors, to strengthen and help diversify the economy of the City, and to promote the use of
historical-cultural landmarks for education, pleasure and welfare of the community.
This overlay zone may be approved upon findings that the application is proper for the
comprehensive and systematic development of the City, is capable of accomplishing the
purposes of this zone, and is compatible with the comprehensive plan and the applicable
specific plan. In order to enable the City Council to evaluate the accomplishment of the
purposes set forth herein, a specific set of plans, submitted in accordance with applicable site
plan review and approval procedures, is required for each MXD district application, and the
City Council is empowered to approve such plans if they find them to be capable of
accomplishing the above purposes and in compliance with the requirements of this zone.
The MXD district overlay regulations supplement the regulations of the underlying zoning
district classification. The Zoning Map shall reflect the designation of a Mixed-Use Overlay
District by the letters "MXD" as a suffix to the underlying zoning district classification.
20.01 Types of MXD Districts
The following types of mixed-use development districts are authorized by this Ordinance:
1. MXD-1 Urban Mixed-Use Development District
2. MXD-2 Planned Mixed-Use Development District
20.02 Location and Siting of MXD Districts
1. Land with existing structures located within the Holly Springs Parkway, Historic and
Hickory Road zoning districts meeting all the purpose requirements set forth in 20.010 is
eligible for MXD-1 overlay.
294
2. MXD districts are most appropriately located in developed urban areas or in areas of
transition between less and more intense land uses where they can serve as a buffer between
such land uses.
20.03 Designing an MXD District
The design of an MXD district is a creative exercise that requires the designer to select from an
array of components available to assemble the district. Essentially, the underlying zoning forms
the basic building block of the district. For each underlying zoning category, there are a number
of land use components which the designer may add to the underlying use to form a mixed-use
development. Mixed-use districts differ from conventional zoning districts in that they are
designed to be located in unique, unusual, or already developed areas or encompass development
schemes that differ markedly from conventional development. As such, the Planning Commission
shall be provided greater discretion in influencing the project in terms of bulk, permitted uses,
layout, and other aspects of the development.
20.04 Permitted and Prohibited Uses
The permitted uses in the MXD district shall be determined by the underlying zoning district plus
a specific amount of the uses specified below. All uses permitted in the underlying zone are also
permitted when that zone designation is overlain with a MXD designation unless specifically
prohibited below.

recommended for the site by the approved and adopted comprehensive or specific plan, including
and granting such easements or making such dedications to the public as may be shown thereon
or as shall be deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility of the development with the
surrounding area and to assure the ability of the area to accommodate the uses proposed by the
application.
302
2. UtilitiesAll utility lines in a MXD development shall be placed underground except that
adaptive reuse developments may have this provision waived upon a finding by City staff that
such requirement would require the replacement or relocation of existing lines. The developer or
subdivider shall ensure final and proper completion and installation of utility lines as provided in
the subdivision regulations. Standards for street lighting shall be provided by the developer in
accordance with the approved site plan.
20.10 Additional Development Requirements

developments shall be located to the rear, a mixture of side and rear, or
underground.
d. Illumination of ParkingAll parking areas shall be illuminated so as to provide
appropriate visibility and security during hours of darkness using technology and
fixtures that will not create a nuisance to other uses within the MXD development
nor to uses adjacent or nearby the MXD development.
e. Fences and Walls--MXD developments are expected to become part of the fabric
of the city rather than be isolated and fenced in. However, fences and walls may
be established with the following provisions:
1) All non-residential uses must be accessible to the public via public sidewalks
and/or streets during operational hours.
2) Fencing adjacent to public right-of way or property shall consist of wrought
iron or decorative steel or aluminum fencing. wood fencing may be used along

a. Location of Commercial UsesGeneral commercial and service uses shall be
concentrated for maximum pedestrian convenience and located for easy accessibility
by residents of the district, workers within the district, and visitors. Commercial uses
shall be located as to be uninterrupted by residential, office, or other non-commercial
uses. It is highly preferable that commercial uses maintain a street presence in a
traditional storefront configuration. Other acceptable locations include an arcade,
interior mall, or in the lobby of a building containing other allowable uses. Strip
commercial with front parking is prohibited.
b. Common WallsCommon walls between residential and non-residential uses should
be constructed so as to minimize the transmission of noise and vibration. Such
common walls shall meet minimum standards for firewalls as required by the City of
Holly Springs.
c. NuisancesNo commercial use shall be designed or operated so as to expose residents
to offensive odors, dust, electrical interference, and or vibration.
d. Limitation of Hours and ActivityCommercial uses shall be designed and operated,
and hours of operation limited where appropriate, so that neighboring residents are not
exposed to offensive noise, especially from traffic and late-night activity. In addition,
no amplified music shall be audible to neighboring residents.
e. Outdoor LightingAll outdoor lighting associated with commercial uses shall be
designed so as not to aversely impact surrounding residential uses, while also providing
a sufficient level of illumination for access and security purposes. Such lighting shall
not be directed toward residential units nor shall such lighting blink, flash, oscillate, or
be of unusual brightness or intensity.

dwellings.
4. Compatibility Standards
All uses shall conform to the purposes of the MXD district and shall be compatible with
all uses, existing or proposed, in the vicinity of the area covered by the proposed MXD
development. In order to assist in accomplishing such external compatibility, the following
requirements shall apply:
a. No buildings other than single-family detached dwellings shall be constructed within
fifty (50) feet of adjoining property that is developed with single-family detached
dwellings unless the Planning Commission finds that topographical or development
features permit a lesser setback. However, in no case shall the setback be less than
thirty-five (35) feet.
b. No building shall be constructed to a height greater than its distance from any adjoining
property designated for residential use on development plan, unless the Planning
Commission finds that approval of a waiver of this requirement will not adversely
affect the adjacent property.
5. Minimum Landscaping Requirements
Minimum standards for landscaping in MXD developments are necessary to ensure that higher
standards of site planning are realized and to tie the separate elements of the mixed-use
development together.
a. A landscape plan meeting the requirements of the "Tree Preservation and Landscaping
Ordinance within the City of Holly Springs Code of Ordinances must be submitted as
part of the preliminary development plan. This can be a separate plan or may be
integrated with the improvements plan required as part of the preliminary plan
submittal. If the project is phased, only the first phase will be required to be provided
in detail, but calculations and proposed plant materials and treatments must be provided
for the entire development.
b. Entry points to the development shall be landscaped in an attractive manner using plant
specimens utilized throughout the remainder of the development.

provide resting and gathering places, recreation areas, aesthetic complements, stormwater
percolation areas, and other purposes. Open space for the purpose of the MXD district
shall be defined as a portion of a lot or other area of land associated with and adjacent to a
building or group of buildings in relation to which it serves to provide light and air, scenic,
recreational, resting, or similar purposes. Such space shall, in general, be available for
entry and use by the occupants of the building(s) with which it is associated, and at times
to the general public. Open space may include a limited proportion of space so located
and treated as to enhance the amenity of development by providing landscaping features,
screening or buffering for the occupants or adjacent landowners, or a general appearance
of openness. Open space shall include parks, commons, plazas, community green or lawn,
landscaped areas, decorative plantings, formal or informal garden, pedestrian walkways or
paths, active and passive recreation areas including playgrounds and swimming pools.

approved landscape plan which meets the minimum requirements of this and other
applicable Ordinances.
e. Either a minimum of one-third (1/3) of required common open space shall be dedicated
to the City as public parkland provided that:
1) Such lands identified for dedication are found acceptable to the City related to size,
shape, topography, maintenance requirements, or other factor affecting the
suitability of the land as public parkland or open space.
2) Dedication may be in one (1) or more parcels conveniently located to the residents
of the development; or
3) One-third of required open space shall be public open space accessible to the
general public for a minimum of fifty (50) hours per week between the hours of 6
a.m. and 10 p.m.
f. Open space may not consist of unimproved or vacant land that does not provide any
natural or man-made amenity. This shall include but not be limited to abandoned or
overgrown lawn area, scrub land or urban fields, eroded areas or areas of exposed soil,
or other land area that, in the opinion of the Planning Commission or their designee,
does not have any functional or aesthetic use as open space.
g. Open space shall be set aside and improved no later than the date on which certificates
of occupancy are issued for the first two-thirds (2/3) of the total number of residential
units to be constructed as part of the project. If residential uses will not be a part of the
project, such open space shall be set aside no later than the date on which certificates
of occupancy are issued for the first seventy-five percent (75%) of commercial space
to be leased or sold as part of the project.
h. All common open space required under this Section shall either be conveyed to the
City of Holly Springs as a city park if the City agrees to accept such space, or it shall
be conveyed to a homeowners association, merchants association, or other association
so created for the purpose of maintaining common area within the project area.
7. Reduction of Required Open Space
a. Adjacent Open Space
The minimum amount of open space required for an MXD development may be
reduced by a maximum of fifty percent (50%) if the MXD site bounds, along at least
307
one property line for a minimum of one hundred (100) feet, public open space including
a park, playground, plaza, garden, or other open space available for and accessible to
public use for recreation, relaxation, walking, etc.
b. Open Space Substitutions
Pedestrian and bicycle amenities may substitute for required open space in the
following manner:
1) Dedicated bike path connected to existing or planned bike route
2) Open pedestrian bridge
3) Raised pedestrian deck
4) Enclosed pedestrian bridge
5) Elevated pedestrian bridge
6) Shopping or through block arcade
Each amenity may be substituted in a 1:1 ratio related to square feet up to fifty (50)
percent of required open space.
8. Compatibility With Surrounding Public Infrastructure
MXD developments must provide public infrastructure improvements that are compatible in
design and function to those of surrounding and adjacent properties. Improvements such as
sidewalks, street lighting, trash receptacles, street furniture, and other public elements shall be
compatible unless this provision is waived by the Planning Commission based on a conclusion
that the proposed improvements are a clear improvement over the existing adjacent infrastructure
or public elements.
9. General Private Deed Covenants
The entire MXD district shall be included within private deed covenants running with the land to
assure the continuance of the planned residential development in accordance with approved plans
and developments.
10. Street Frontage Requirement
In an MXD development, the street frontage requirements for townhouses or mixed-family
dwellings may be waived.
Compliance with these requirements shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to create a presumption
of compatibility.
308
20.11 Application Procedures and Requirements
1. Sketch Plan
Applicants are encouraged but not required to submit a sketch plan which provides a general
concept of the project expected to be submitted. There are no specific requirements for a sketch
plan because this step is provided solely for the benefit of the applicant to get an initial review and
response to the project by staff. The level of detail is low because the applicant is seeking a general
reaction to the concept and does not need to spend large amounts of money on detailed engineering
drawings. However, it would be useful for the sketch plan to indicate land use distribution, open
space, circulation systems, a summary of residential and non-residential density, and other major
elements. A sketch plan may be submitted at any time and a meeting with staff may be arranged
as needed.
2. Concept Plan
The applicants shall submit a concept plan for the proposed development which shall consist of a
professionally designed schematic plan indicating the layout of the development. Two (2)
complete sets of the concept plan shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department on
an 18 x 24 plat plus one (1) copy of each graphic in 8½ x 11 format. This plan shall contain
the following elements:
a. Identify the boundary of the property;
b. Provide a delineation of phases (if applicable);
c. indicate proposed land uses including square footage or acreage and percentage of each
component;
d. indicate the density of uses within each land use component or phase using units per
acre for residential uses and floor area ratio (FAR) for non-residential components as
well as the overall density of the project for each land use component. This initial
density report shall contain those elements on which density is based including:
1) Overall site area (all figures in acres and square feet)
2) Overall buildable area (excluding wetlands, floodplain, steep slopes, etc.)
3) Overall unbuildable area (the area of land excluded in b.)
4) Density exclusions (open space, pedestrian walkways)
5) Proposed project density by land use type
6) Proposed phase density by land use type
7) Phasing schedule;
e. show a proposed vehicular and pedestrian circulation plan including entrances and
exits;
309
f. show existing natural features of the site including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams,
wetlands, steep slopes, mature trees and tree stands, and other natural features;
g. show where proposed open space will be provided by type of open spacelandscaped
area, community green, plaza, formal or informal garden, natural area set aside.
Indicate proposed square footage or acreage and percentage of open space as a part of
total project;
h. indicate location of landscaping and buffers; and
i. show the location of existing and proposed buildings as well as adjacent buildings and
land uses.

areas of non-conformity. Staff, upon review of the plan and subsequent to the meeting with the
applicant, will officially determine whether the concept meets the intent of the zone as provided
in Chapter 20, 20.010 within this Ordinance and provides the required elements. If the concept
does not meet with the intent of this Section or lacks required elements, staff may reject the concept
plan. However, should the plan meet the intent of this Section and contain the required elements,
staff will accept the concept plan and provide the applicant with suggestions for changes and
modifications, if any, that will prepare the applicant for the submittal of the rezoning application
and development plan. While the applicant may request more than one concept plan review, at
least one review is mandatory.

October 16, 2018 7-1
Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
7.1 Purpose.
7.1-1 General Agricultural District (AG). The purpose of this district is to maintain the integrity of
agricultural activities predominate in the rural area of Cherokee County. Within the district, the
subdivision of land for suburban development is discouraged, while agriculture and livestock
production are strongly encouraged in order to maintain the rural character of these areas. Onsite
sales should be limited to live animals, plants and produce that have been raised on the
property, unless this Ordinance specifically provides for limited related commercial activities for
particular uses. (Ord. No. 2018-O-003, 04/03/2018)
7.1-2 Estate Residential District (R-80, R-60). The purpose of this district is to permit residential
development in those areas that are expected to become more nearly urban in character. The
areas involved are generally in transition from agricultural to residential development and are
considered appropriate for low density residential development. Limited agricultural uses, such
as crop production and animal husbandry, on tracts of 5 acres or more are also compatible with
this district.
7.1-3 Single-Family Residential Districts (R-40, R-30). The purpose of these residential districts
is to enable residential development of a low density urban character. The regulations are
designed to permit and encourage residential development in areas where urbanization is taking
place. Limited agricultural uses, such as crop production and animal husbandry, on tracts of 5
acres or more are also compatible with this district.
7.1-4 Single-Family Residential Districts (R-20). The purpose of this residential district is to
permit and encourage development of medium density single-family residential uses in a
moderately spacious surrounding. The R-20 development district shall be served with an
approved community water system.
7.1-5 Single-Family Residential (R-15, RD-3, RZL). The purpose of these residential districts is
to permit and encourage development of high density single family residential uses in a
moderately spacious surrounding. These development districts shall be served with an
approved community water system and a central sewerage system.
7.1-6 Single-Family Attached Residential Districts (RA, RTH). The purpose of this district is to
provide for intermediate housing types and densities between single-family detached and multifamily
dwellings. Such development may include duplexes, triplexes, quadruplexes or
townhouses to be located in the urban portion or suburban portion of the county where
apartment buildings would not be compatible. Innovative design with cluster development is
encouraged. Such development districts are intended to be served with central sewerage
system except for lot sizes exceeding 20,000 square feet.
7.1-7 Multi-Family Residential District (RM-10, RM-16). The purpose of the residential districts
is to permit development of high density multi-family residential dwellings. These zoning
districts are to be located where public water supply and sewerage facilities are available or can
be obtained and where there is convenient access to collector streets or major thoroughfares.
The use of these districts can be developed as a transition zone between residential districts
and commercial districts.
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-2
7.1-8 Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND). Traditional Neighborhood Development is
a floating district which may be located within any residential district if it meets all the standards
for a Traditional Neighborhood Development. The purpose of this district is to encourage
flexible and innovative design in site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of
development regulation instead of standard zoning regulation. Traditional Neighborhood
Developments shall be planned as integral units and may be residential, commercial or a
combination of land uses. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the
provision of roads and utilities and flexibility in design. The community benefits from efficient
use of land, preservation of natural amenities and environmental sensitive areas and lower
development and housing costs. Review and approval of the development plan provides the
opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the
neighborhood in which it is located.
7.1-9 Office/Institutional District (OI). The purpose of this district is to provide a location for
office, institutional, medical and educational development. Limited related retail business and
service activities may be permitted but not involved with storage and processing.
7.1-10 Corporate Park District (CP). The purpose of this district is to provide for suitable areas
for developments that are primarily for offices for businesses, professional services, and sales
activities with a limited amount of retail uses within master-planned developments or parks. This
district should be accessible to an arterial. An overall concept plan is required within this zoning
district in order to guide each development. (Ord. 2011-Z-001, 03-01-11)
7.1-11 Neighborhood Commercial District (NC). The purpose of this district is to provide for
limited retail activities, commercial sales, personal services and professional offices to serve the
general need of a residential neighborhood. Development of commercial uses is regulated for
compatibility with the surrounding residential areas. Districts are located to create commercial
centers or clusters and to discourage commercial strip development. In addition, these uses
shall have a maximum allowed floor space of 10,000 square feet per acre of total building floor
space. (Ord. 2006-Z-006, 06-06-06)
7.1-12 General Commercial District (GC). The purpose of this district is to provide sufficient
space in appropriate locations for a wide variety of commercial sales and service activities
which generally serve a wide area. The permitted uses are generally located along the major
thoroughfares of the county. Activities with limited storage may be permitted. Districts are
located to create centers or concentrations of commercial activities and to discourage
commercial strip development.
7.1-13 Light Industrial District (LI). The purpose of this district is to provide suitable areas for
industrial development but whose proximity to residential or commercial districts makes it
desirable to limit the intensity of industrial operations and processes. This district limits
industrial, manufacturing and warehousing uses to those which are wholly conducted indoors,
with the exception of limited amounts of outdoor storage which shall be screened and situated in
a side or rear yard. The district should be accessible to a major arterial or State Highway.
Permitted uses are restricted to those which are not characterized by smoke, dust, fumes, gas,
heat, glare, fire hazards, noise, vibrations and other nuisances. (Ord. 2011-Z-001, 03-01-11)
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-3
7.1-14 Heavy Industrial District (HI). The purpose of this district is to provide suitable areas for
industrial operations and processes conducted both indoors and outdoors. Due to the intensity
of these uses, the district should be located on or have ready access to a major arterial or State
Highway and separated from residential areas by significant natural barriers and/or buffers.
(Ord. 2011-Z-001, 03-01-11)
7.2 Development Standards.
The requirements regarding lot size, building site and building placement on the lot for each
zone district shall be met as indicated in Section 7.3 Application of Standards, Table 7.1;
Minimum District Development Standards and additional requirements listed in Section 7.4.
7.3 Application of Standards.
7.3-1 Lots of Record. Any lot or record which is legal at the time of the adoption or amendment
of this Ordinance, that has an area or width that is less than required by this Ordinance, may be
used, subject to the following exceptions and modifications.
a. Individual Lot Not Meeting Minimum Lot Size Requirements. Except as set forth in
Section 7.3-1a, in any Zoning District in which one-family dwellings are permitted, any lot
of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance which has an
area, width or depth less than that required by this Ordinance may be used as a building
site for a one-family dwelling.
In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at
the same time build a minimum width one-family dwelling, the Zoning Board of Appeals
is hereby authorized to grant a variance reducing the side-yard requirements for such lot
the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling, but in no case shall each of
the side yards be less than five (5) feet in width.
7.3-2 Lot Area. No lot shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth, size of yards, lot area
per family or any other requirement of this Ordinance is not maintained. This limitation shall not
apply:
a. When a portion of a lot is acquired for a public purpose.
b. To dormitories, fraternities, sororities and other similar living quarters which are
accessory to a permitted use and which have no cooking facilities in individual rooms or
apartments.
c. To rental units in a hotel, motel, motor lodge, tourist home or to rooms in a rooming or
boarding house.
7.3-3 Corner Lots. The minimum yard requirements for corner lots with multiple road frontages
shall not be less than the minimum front yard requirements for such lots as specified for each
district. Such yards shall be classified as required front yards.
7.3-4 Through Lots. On lots having frontage on two (2) streets, but not located on a corner, the
minimum front yard shall be provided on each street in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance.
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-4
7.3-5 Double Frontage Corner Lot. On lots having frontage on more than two (2) streets, the
minimum front yard shall be provided in accordance with the regulations set forth in this
Ordinance on at least two (2) of the street frontages. The minimum front yard on the other
frontage or frontages may be reduced along the other streets in accordance with the provisions
of Section 7.3-3.
7.3-6 Density. No building or structure shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed or
altered to:
a. House greater number of families per acre or occupy a smaller lot area per family than
are herein required.
b. Have narrower or smaller front, rear or side yards than are herein required.
7.3-7 Yards and Other Spaces.
a. No part of a yard of the off-street parking or loading spaces that are required in
connection with any building or use for the purpose of complying with the regulations of
this Ordinance shall be included as part of the yard or off-street parking or loading
spaces required for another building, except as specifically provided herein.
b. Whenever a lot abuts upon a public alley, one-half of the alley width may be considered
as a portion of the required yard.
c. Where these regulations refer to side streets, the Zoning Administrator shall be guided by
the pattern of development in the vicinity of the lot in question in determining which of two
streets is the side street.
d. Every part of a required yard (except rear yards) shall be open to the sky, except as
authorized by this article and excepting ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, window
air conditioning units, chimneys, cornices and ornamental features which may project to a
distance not to exceed twenty-four (24) inches into a required yard.
7.3-8 Front Yards.
a. Where an official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a street
or major thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, the depth of a front or side yard shall be
measured from such official line to the nearest line of the building.
b. Platforms or paved terraces, not covered by a roof or canopy and which do not extend
above the level of the first floor of the building, may extend or project into the front or side
yard not more than six (6) feet. Unenclosed porches shall be considered part of the main
structure.
c. Within the same block and zoning district, when twenty-five percent (25%) or more or the
existing buildings which are located within two hundred (200) feet of each side of a lot
have less than the minimum required setback, the setback of such lot should not exceed
the average of the existing setbacks.
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-5
7.3-9 Side Yards.
a. For the purpose of the side yard regulations, a group of business or commercial building
separated by common or party walls shall be considered as one building occupying one
lot.
7.3-10 Rear Yards. Open or lattice-enclosed fire escapes, outside stairways, balconies opening
up on fire towers and the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues, may project into the
required, but only where the same are so placed as not to obstruct light and ventilation.
7.4 Development Standards Additional Requirements.
7.4-1 Single-Family Residential (R-15)
a. Development in district R-15 shall be served with public or private central sewerage.
7.4-1.1 Single-Family Residential (RD-3)
a. Intent:
The RD-3 district shall be designed around the Public Realm. The area between the front
of house on one side of a street and the front of the house on the other side of the street
comprise a public space, or the Public Realm. This area is differentiated from the private
space located in the backyards of the homes. Generally, homeowners concern
themselves with the street presence of their home. Yards are neatly trimmed,
landscaping is installed, and decorations adorn the front face of the house so as to be
seen by the neighbors. The Public Realm is the area in a neighborhood where residents
engage one another. The design of the Public Realm is focused on the experience of the
pedestrian so the presence of automobiles should be minimized to enhance the
communitys enjoyment of the public streetscape.
b. Infrastructure:
Development in RD-3 district shall be served with public water and public or private
central sewage.
c. Documentation:
1. Zoning  A proposed site plan must be submitted to Planning and Zoning for review
and comment prior to RD-3 rezoning request. Typical lot layouts with building
footprints and elevations/renderings of the proposed housing product are also
required. More information about specific requirements when requesting RD-3
zoning can be found in Article 18 of the Zoning Ordinance.
2. Development Plan  If property is already zoned RD-3, a preliminary technical review
meeting is required with Development Review staff. At this time, actual lot layouts
with building footprints, elevations/renderings and design palette of the final housing
product are required for review and comment by staff.
3. Building Permit  A house location plan must be approved by Cherokee County prior
to the issuance of a building permit for a RD-3 lot.
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-6
d. Overall Site Constraints:
1. The minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet creates the opportunity for open space to
be included in the design of the development. A minimum of thirty (30) percent of the
property must be set aside as Open Space. Yield of no more than 3 units per acre.
2. The street network shall be designed and constructed as a series of interconnecting
roads. The use of cul de sacs is strongly discouraged and only allowed if approved
as a necessity by the County Engineer. Instead the use of loop lanes and crescents
are encouraged as alternatives to the traditional cul de sac design.
3. There shall be an exterior building setback of 50 feet on the perimeter of the property
being developed as an RD-3 development. Should the development abut an existing
RD-3 development, the exterior building setback would be reduced to 25 feet if the
two properties are not being developed as a single master planned development.
4. On street parking shall be provided for guests at the rate of 0.25 spaces per home.
5. At minimum, thirty (30) percent of the lots are required to be served by alley access.
e. Required Open Space:
1. Open Space consists of a combination of Civic Spaces and Natural Areas. Typical
Civic Spaces include Amenities, Greens, Commons, Pocket Parks and Courts. No
more than fifty (50) percent of the total Open Space requirement can be met with
Civic Spaces. The majority of Open Space is not allowed to be placed behind a small
number of private lots. Stormwater detention ponds may not be used to meet Open
Space requirements.
2. Civic Space shall be configured and distributed in such areas as to provide a central
location for the majority of residents within the subdivision. Civic Space is required to
be accessible by internal street network with at least forty (40) percent of the
perimeter of a Civic Space fronting on a street. Crosswalks are required to be
installed where necessary to provide safe passage to Civic Spaces. Civic Spaces are
encouraged to provide a benefit to the residents (examples include: picnic area,
playground, multi-purpose sports field, walking trail, community garden), where
appropriate. A detailed landscape plan is required to be provided for each Civic
Space.
3. Natural Areas should be configured to conserve and integrate the environmentally
sensitive lands as a significant feature of the neighborhood design. Typical Natural
areas include wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes, and wildlife habitat. The entirety of
the Natural Areas should not consist of undisturbed buffers. The surrounding
landscape should be considered in the design, and where possible the view into the
property should be preserved. Access to each Natural Area shall be provided by
road frontage or an access easement recorded on the final plat.
f. Streetscape Design:
1. The minimum street section shall consist of the following elements in order (see
Figure 7.4-1):
 5 foot sidewalk
 5 - 6 foot planting strip for trees and street lights
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-7
 2 foot curb and gutter
 (Two) 10 foot travel lanes

Figure 7.4-2:
 Utility easement
 Drainage swale or curb and gutter
 (One) 9 foot travel lane for one-way traffic or (two) 9 foot travel lanes for twoway
traffic
 Drainage swale or curb and gutter
 Utility easement
3. On-street parking may be provided with a dedicated lane of a minimum 7 foot width
or as a bay of angled parking.
4. Street trees are required to be located along the roads internal to the residential
development. Trees should be planted within the planting strip and placed every
thirty (30) to forty-five (45) feet. Trees should be placed to provide adequate sight
distance at driveways and intersections.
5. Lighting along the street should be installed at a pedestrian height (15 ft max.)
instead of at a height for automobiles, unless expressly required by the County
Engineer.
6. Planning staff has the authority to modify required streetscape elements based on
specific site conditions.

minimum width of twelve (12) feet.
 Front door, which may not be recessed from the front plane of the home.
3. Porches are strongly encouraged. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the homes are
required to have covered front porches. Porches are permitted to encroach into the
front setback area.
4. Garages shall be set back a distance of 20 feet from the front face of the primary
residence, to avoid front elevations dominated by garages that are located closer to
the front property line than the front of the primary structure. The front face of the
primary residence is defined as the plane consisting of the majority of the front
elevation of the structure. Modifications to the 20 foot requirement may be approved
as follows:
a. Front Façade with a Covered Porch  20 foot setback may be measured from
the front edge of the porch.
b. Front Façade with architectural treatment of garage  garage setback may be
reduced by up to 10 feet with the following architectural treatments for the
garage doors:

7.5-2 Plan Format. Plan format refers to Section 18.3-3c: Site Plan Format.
7.5-3 General Site Development and Design Regulations for Commercial and Industrial
Districts.
7.5-3.1 Purpose and Intent. Careful attention to attractive and citizen-friendly community
design is in the economic interests of Cherokee County, its citizens, and business owners.
Attractive and integrated community design features tend to improve the Countys image, raise
overall property values, attract new businesses, and improve the quality of life. Investment in
design features tends to result in a positive return on investment for property owners, private
industry, and government. For example, the money spent on landscaped roadway medians,
sidewalks, and street trees is likely to be amply returned in the form of increased tax revenue
resulting from the overall increase in property values that accompanies attractive and desirable
urban and suburban areas.
Much of the existing commercial and industrial development in Cherokee County, particularly
development along the County's principal highways, is in need of aesthetic and functional
enhancement. Existing conditions that are inconsistent with the objectives quality community
design include: chain link fencing enclosures of autos and trailers without adequate screening;
various building materials and/or equipment stored in front yards in view of the traveling public;
continuous, uncurbed, highway access; old, dilapidated, and/or unattractive awnings and façade
treatments; excessive signage in the form of fluttering ribbons, portable signs, sandwich signs,
and welcome flags; a lack of front yard landscaping; storage/maintenance bay doors and
loading areas facing the highway; dumpsters placed in front/side yards in unobstructed view
from highways; and a general lack of interparcel access (i.e., connections between adjacent
developments).
It is the intent of Cherokee County to require new commercial and industrial developments
install appropriate improvements and comply with general design regulations intended to
improve aesthetic appearance and function. It is also the intent of the County to require
substantial progress toward compliance with these improvement requirements and general
design regulations in cases where existing businesses are expanded.
These design regulations are intended to merge traffic engineering, civil engineering, urban
design, landscape architecture, and land use planning principles into a set of regulations for
commercial developments and properties in the unincorporated areas of the County. The
regulations are the minimum necessary to: preserve the carrying capacity of major arteries;
reduce the number of vehicular turning movements to and from the major artery, thereby
reducing the potential for automobile and pedestrian traffic accidents; encourage and promote
the most suitable uses of land; ensure the adequate grading and draining of developments;
promote an environment which reduces the visual clutter and other distracting characteristics
resulting from various aspects typical of urban and suburban commercial strip development;
prohibit the needless, wasteful and purposeless aesthetic degradation of the Countys highway
and major street corridors; and promote a more healthy environment.
7.5-3.2 Applicability. This article shall apply to all properties located within commercial (GC,
NC, HC, OI) and Industrial (LI) zoning districts of unincorporated Cherokee County. New
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-16
development shall be required to conform to these regulations. A substantial improvement of an
existing development shall be required to conform to these regulations or, in cases where
physically impossible, make substantial progress toward meeting the regulations contained
within this chapter. Substantial improvement shall be defined as increasing the floor space
dedicated to commercial/ industrial operations by more than 50%, the addition of a new or
increase of an open storage area by more than 30% of the existing area.
7.5-3.3 Site Requirements. The following requirements are applicable to the development of
all commercial and industrial sites or properties in Cherokee County.
a. Utilities. All utilities, including but not limited to electric and telephone lines,
serving uses on site should be installed underground where appropriate and permissible.
b. Grading and Site Development. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately
drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. Grading plans
for new development shall be submitted to the County Engineer for review and approval,
and all grading activities shall comply with approved plans. Stormwater management
plans shall be submitted to the County Engineer for review and approval. All disturbed
or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas
shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping
materials.
c. Screening of Outside Storage Yards. All areas devoted to the outside storage of
vehicles, merchandise, and/or equipment not intended for display for public rent, lease,
or sale, shall be screened from view from the right-of-way of the highway or major street
along the entire property frontage, except in areas where access crossings have been
approved. Screening may be accomplished by a vegetative buffer either planted or
undisturbed or a combination of both, by a building that meets architectural standards of
this chapter, by use of landscape material, either planted or existing, by an earthen
berm, by a 70 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these
screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display
areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this
requirement.
d. Outdoor Lighting. All outdoor lighting installed shall be of such height, location
and intensity so that direct illumination of the right-of-way of the highway or major street
is avoided. The installation of shields or hoods on such lighting facilities may be
required to comply with this standard. All lighting shall comply with the Zoning Ordinance
of Cherokee County, Article 24 Outdoor Lighting and Road Glare Ordinance.
e. Landscaping. Every building site and commercial / industrial use area shall be
landscaped. A minimum (10 ft.) ten-foot wide landscape strip shall be installed and
maintained along the entire property fronting the highway or major street, except in
cases where access areas are approved. A minimum six-foot wide landscape strip shall
be required along all side and rear lot or lease lines, except in cases where shared
driveways or access areas are approved. The area surrounding the road entrance(s) to
the site or area, the front landscape strip, required parking lot landscaping, and all other
required landscape and/or open spaces, shall be designed, installed, and maintained
according to plans prepared by a professional landscape architect, architect, surveyor,
engineer, or land planner submitted to and approved by Cherokee County. Landscaping
shall be completed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the County, unless
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-17
appropriate provisions are made to guarantee the installation of landscaping after such
certificate is issued, such as approval by the County of a bond for landscaping. Tree
installation and removal shall be in compliance standards provided in the Zoning
Ordinance of Cherokee County, Article 25 Tree Preservation and Replanting Standards,
as may be amended from time to time, and administrative standards for the preservation
and replacement of trees as adopted and as may be amended from time to time.
f. Location of Parking Areas. Parking areas shall be set back at least ten (10) feet
from public rights-of-ways. Parking areas are encouraged but not required to be located
in side and rear yards where such parking areas can be partially or wholly screened by
buildings from the public right-of-way. The 10 foot strip between the public ROW and the
edge of parking area shall be landscaped with evergreen vegetation capable of reaching
a height of three feet and / or able to withstand pruning to a height of three feet, The
purpose of the vegetation is to reduce the visual impact of the parked vehicles by
screening from public view the parking area.
g. Open Display of Vehicles, Equipment, and Merchandise. In commercial /
industrial zoning districts where permitted, the outside storage or display of vehicles,
equipment, and merchandise to be rented, leased, or sold, shall be visible along no
more than fifty percent (50) of the frontage of the property abutting the highway or major
street, excluding approved driveway entrances and exits. Screening may be
accomplished by a natural and/or planted vegetative buffer, by a building that meets
architectural standards of this chapter, by use of landscape material, either planted or
existing, by an earthen berm, by a 70 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or
combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does
not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed
to comply with this requirement.
h. Plans. Site development as-built drawings, containing a boundary survey,
location, elevation, height, and square footage of buildings, parking areas, utilities, walls,
and stormwater facilities, pertinent site development data, and any other requirements of
the Planning Director or County Engineer, shall be submitted to and approved by the
department prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or completion.

7.5-3.6 Access Requirements. The following development requirements are applicable to all
commercial / industrial sites or properties in Cherokee County.
a. Curb Cuts and Access Specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or
driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the State
Department of Transportation and the County Engineer prior to the construction of such
entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any development permit for any
improvement to be served by such entrances or exits.
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-20
No curb cut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than one hundred
(100) feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway or
closer than forty (40) feet to a side property line unless the adjacent property owner is in
agreement with the encroachment of the driveway and approval is obtained from the
County Engineer. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than twenty four
(24) feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may
not be practical in all instances as determined by the County Engineer. The County
Engineer may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a
parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the
public.
In cases of a substantial improvement of an existing development on a site that does not
meet these curb cut and access specifications, the applicant may be required by the
County Engineer to prepare an access plan as part of plans for the substantial
improvement that either meets these requirements or moves substantially toward
compliance with these regulations. Approval by the Georgia Department of
Transportation and the County Engineer shall be required, as applicable.
Additional right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public as required by the most current
functional classification of Cherokee County roads as designated by the County
Engineer, and as reasonable at the discretion of the County Engineer. Roadway
entrances and improvements, including necessary deceleration lane(s) and right/left turn
lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the State Department
of Transportation, as applicable, or the County Engineer, in accordance with State or
County requirements, as applicable and as may be amended from time to time.
The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific
location of an entrance: 1) The location of existing or planned median breaks; 2)
separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections; 3) separation
requirements between other entrances; 4) the need to provide shared access with other
sites; 5) the need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the
opposite side of the street; 6) and the minimum number of entrances needed to move
traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently.
b. Interparcel Connections. New commercial / industrial development containing, or
that is intended to contain, more than one building or use on site shall provide
connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be
accomplished without using the adjacent highway(s) or major street(s). Joint or shared
drives are encouraged. Where possible and practical, new developments and substantial
improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile
access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the
uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings
or uses in the same vehicle trip.
c. Location of Loading and Unloading Areas. All areas and facilities devoted to the
loading and unloading of goods and merchandise shall be located to the side or rear of
the building and lot. Loading and unloading areas shall not front the right-of-way of the
adjacent highway or major street. Overhead doors for loading bays shall not face the
adjacent highway or major street. This section does not apply to those industrial
buildings which are interior to a planned industrial park, adjoin only other industrial
parcels, and have frontage only on roads developed as part of the industrial park.
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-21
In cases where this regulation is not practical for new development or in cases where an
existing building to be substantially improved does not meet the requirements in this
section, the property shall be screened from view from the adjacent highway or major
street along the entire property frontage, except in cases where access areas are
approved. Buildings that are permitted to have overhead doors facing the public right-ofway
shall incorporate design features so that aesthetic impact of the overhead doors is
softened through architectural detailing, or staggering with recesses and projections or
additional landscape buffer.
7.5-4 Commercial Architectural Standards
a. Facades  Major commercial buildings (over 5000 square foot footprint) must have
primarily naturally-colored brick or natural stone facades, with stucco, cast stone and
hardiplank used only as accent materials. Smaller commercial buildings may use
hardiplank or stucco as the primary façade material, if they are built in a residential
architectural style compatible with such materials. This requirement applies to all sides
of buildings, except where one or more sides are 80% visually from view from any point
off the property.
b. Roof Lines  All commercial roof lines must include detailed cornices and/or detailed
parapets.
c. Where parking lots adjoin public roads, they must have low (2-3 ft.) shrubbery and/or
a landscaped berm to partially shield the parked cars from view.
d. Inter-and Intra-Parcel Access  Except where determined by county staff to be
impractical, commercial parking areas must provide inter-parcel access to adjacent
commercial properties. Parcels over 5 acres with access on two or more public roads
must provide intra-parcel streets to connect between their entrances on different roads.
These connecting streets cannot just be lanes in a parking area; they must be separated
from parking areas by curbs.
e. Freestanding Outdoor Lighting  Shall consist of decorative poles and fixtures not
more than 30 feet tall.
f. Parcels inside the City of Cantons Growth Boundary that are developed or redeveloped
without annexing shall substantially conform to Cantons Streetscapes
requirements and guidelines.
7.5-5 Location of Large Retail Stores. To promote public safety, mitigate, and accommodate
traffic congestion, individual retail stores with building areas greater than 80,000 square feet
must be located as follows:
a. With at least one primary access point on a multi-lane road.
b. At least ½ mile away from schools.
For the purpose, the following definitions and clarifications shall apply:
a. The building areas of adjacent stores shall be aggregated and considered a single
individual store if they are under common management and/or have common
Cherokee County Zoning Ordinance Article 7  District Uses and Regulations
October 16, 2018 7-22
customer check-out processes.
b. Multi-land road means a public road with at least four through-lanes (excluding
turning and accel/decel lanes) with a length of at least one mile from the stores point
of public road access and/or leading to other multi-lane roads combining for at least
one mile in length.
c. School means a public school serving any or all of grads kindergarten through 12.
d. Distance from a school shall be measured as the shortest straight line from any point
on a school property to the closest point of the actual store building.
7.6 Permitted Uses. No use shall be permitted, except in the zoning districts indicated and for
the purposes permitted in the Table 7.2 Permitted Uses Table.
a. General. Each use is mutually exclusive and does not encompass other uses
listed in the table. All uses are subject to all terms and conditions of this Zoning
Ordinance, any other Ordinance of Cherokee County, state and federal law and
any other applicable rules and regulations.
b. Open Use. A principal use listed in Table 7.2 in any district denoted by the letter
O is permitted by right for open use within that district without additional,
specialized requirements.
c. Restricted Use. A principal use listed in Table 7.2 in any district denoted by the
letter R is permitted by right as a Restricted Use within that district only if
additional, specialized requirements have been met as provided in Section 7.7
Permitted Uses Additional Requirements.
d. Special Use. A principal use listed in Table 7.2 in any district denoted by the
letter S is designated as a Special Use within that district and permitted only
upon compliance with Article 18.4 Special Use Permits of this Ordinance and the
grant of a Special Use Permit by the Board of Commissioners. In addition, any
Special Use is subject to the Section 7.7 Permitted Uses Additional Requirements
for that Special Use.
e. Classification Standards and Codes. The Permitted Uses in Table 7.2 are
organized utilizing the Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) developed by
the American Planning Association and the North American Industrial
Classification System (NAICS) used by the U.S. Census Bureau. The LBCS
classifies land uses across five dimensions, Activity, Function, Structure Type,
Site Development Character, and Ownership. For the purposes of this ordinance,
the Function classification has been used because it refers to the economic
function or type of establishment using the land. The NAICS is the standard used
by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the
purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S.
business economy. Cherokee County uses the NAICS codes to classify
businesses for the purpose of issuing Occupational Tax Certificates (i.e.,
commonly referred to as Business Licenses). The use of these two classification
systems together allows for a comprehensive and detailed regulation of Land
Use. Each use provided for in Table 7.2 should be read in conjunction with the

governed by this section; provided, however, that the governing authority
may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this section
are better served thereby.
a. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or subject to any
applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b. At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall,
to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and
landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and
built environment.

APPENDIX B - TREE DENSITY CALCULATION
A basic requirement of the Tree Conservation and Replacement Ordinance is that all applicable
sites maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of
the Basal area (a standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with "tree".
This density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to
development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved,
planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula.
SDF - EDF = RDF
Where:
SDF (Site Density Factor)The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a
developed site (units per acre).
EDF (Existing Density Factor)Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
RDF (Replacement Density Factor)Density of new trees to be planted on a site.
The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of acres by the tree density requirement;
EXAMPLE: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 × 20 = 44
The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor
units. Table B.1 below show this calculation.
EXAMPLE: A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site. The tree inventory is
as follows:
712 inch diameter pines 121 inch diameter hickory
314 inch diameter pines 130 inch diameter oak
318 inch diameter pines
Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined as follows:
TABLE B.1 EXAMPLE CONVERSION
DBH UNITS NO. OF TREES TOTALS
12 inch 0.8 × 7 = 5.6
14 inch 1.2 × 3 = 3.6
18 inch 1.8 × 3 = 5.4
21 inch 2.6 × 1 = 2.6
30 inch 4.4 × 1 = 4.4
21.6
See section 18.7.B for Tree Density Requirements and calculation for "For-Sale" residential lots.

Note: DBH is rounded to nearest inch (.5 and higher to next full inch, .4 and lower is truncated to lower inch).
Note: Values for tree sizes 24 inch and greater are for trees that do not qualify as Specimen
Trees and are not subject to Specimen Tree designation under Appendix A. Trees qualifying
as Specimen Trees are subject to the benefits and restrictions note in the previously cited
section.

The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
EXAMPLE: RDF = 44 - 21.6 = 22.4

Tree Replacement Requirements:
1. No more than 30% of all trees planted for replacement density credit may be of
any one species.
2. Seven-gallon Pine trees to be planted to meet required replacement densities
must be at least one-inch (1?) in Caliper and greater than or equal to four feet (4')
tall.
3. Specimen Tree replacement/recompense trees must be at least four-inch (4?)

APPENDIX C - SPECIMEN TREES
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for conservation. These
trees are referred to as Specimen Trees. The following criteria are used by the Director to
identify specimen trees:
A Specimen Tree is any tree which qualifies for special consideration for preservation
due to its size, type, condition, location, or historical significance and is determined by
the City Arborist, prior to development, to be in overall good health without the aid of a
specialized care plan according to accepted ISA practices, and which also meets the
minimum size criteria set forth below.
Size Criteria:
Pine Trees: 30-inch (30?) diameter or larger.
Overstory Trees: 24-inch (24?) diameter or larger.
Understory Trees: 8-inch (8?) diameter or larger.
In order to encourage the conservation of Specimen Trees and the incorporation of these
trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for Specimen Trees,
which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose.
Credit for any Specimen Tree thus saved would be two (2) times the assigned unit value
shown in Table B.3. The Critical Root Zone of Specimen Trees will be protected with
hog-back/wire-back tree save fencing with metal support poles or as described in section
18.11.
If a Specimen Tree is to be removed, a plan or written document indicating the reason for
the removal must be submitted to the Director.
Specimen Trees that cannot be saved (see Section 18.11) must be replaced with trees
having two (2) times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch (4?)
tree caliper by species with potentials for comparable size and quality.
Any Specimen Tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the
Director must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to eight (8) times the unit
value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch (4?) tree caliper. Size alone will
determine whether a tree was a specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval
and there is no evidence of its condition. Violations will be subject to the applicable
penalties as described in Section 18.19.
Specimen trees removed on "For-Sale" Residential lots not in conjunction with

 The City of Holly Springs Community Development Department reserves the right to
require additional erosion and sedimentation control measures deemed necessary.
 The contractor shall implement all Best Management Practices for forestry as
prescribed by the Georgia Forestry Commission and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
 No trees may be cut in buffer zones marked "undisturbed." Tree cutting shall be
limited to the non-mechanical removal of pine (Pinus spp.) or yellow-poplar
(Lirodendron tulipifera) trees with stump diameters greater than fifteen (15) inches;
provided that a minimum of fifty (50) square feet of basal area remains in good
D-3
condition in the buffer area at completion of the project. The non-mechanical removal
of dead, diseased or insect infested trees is also allowed in this buffer (subject to
verification by the City of Holly Springs Arborist).
 All buffers of state waters shall remain undisturbed except for haul road crossing
points.
 Projects, which are restricted to a "Residential Thinning", must leave a minimum
density of thirty (30) square feet of basal area throughout all areas not designated as
buffers or logging decks. Trees to be preserved to meet this requirement must be
identifiable both before and after the harvest either by species or by a continuous
marking around the trunk at 4.5 feet and at .5 feet above the ground. These trees must
be left in good condition with no injuries to the trunk, crown or root system, which
would predispose them to disease or pest infestation.
All pine logging slash with stems larger than five (5) inches in diameter shall be
chipped and returned to the site or removed from the site to reduce the possibility of
insect infestation.
 Logging decks, temporary haul roads, skid trails and any other disturbed areas left idle
for two to four weeks will be restored to their contours and established to temporary
vegetation (DsD). These disturbed areas left idle for four weeks or more will be
established to permanent vegetation (Ds3). All areas remaining at the end of the project
will be established to permanent vegetation within two weeks.
 When hand planting, mulch (hay or straw) should be uniformly spread over seeded
area within 24 hours of seeding.
 During unstable growing seasons, mulch will be used as a temporary cover (Ds1). On
slopes that are 4:1 or steeper, mulch will be anchored.
 The City of Holly Springs Land Disturbance Permit must be displayed on site at all
times during the project operation and in plain view from an adjacent county road or
street.
Before any activity can begin an inspection must be performed for basal area confirmation,
erosion control devices and buffer area delineation. At this time, the contractor must show a
current City of Holly Springs occupational tax certificate or registration certificate. At
completion of the project, a final inspection must be performed.

Technical Standards
1. Tree Measurements
a. Diameter at Breast Height (DBH): The standard measure of tree size (for
trees existing on a site). The tree trunk is measured at a height of 4 1/2 feet
above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4 1/2 feet, the
trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split.
b. Caliper: A standard of trunk measurement for replacement trees. Caliper
inches are measured at the height of 6 inches above the ground for trees
up to and including 4 inch caliper and 12 inches above the ground for
trees larger than 4 inch caliper.
E-4
c. Critical Root Zone (CRZ): The minimum area beneath a tree which must be
left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a
reasonable chance of survival. The Critical Root Zone will typically be
represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius
equal in feet to one and three-tenths (1.3) times the number of inches of the
trunk diameter.
i. EXAMPLE: The CRZ radius of a twenty (20) inch diameter tree is
twenty-six
(26) feet.
d. Structural Root Plate (SRP): The zone of rapid root taper that provides the
tree stability against wind throw. The radius of the structural root plate is
equal to 0.5 feet per inch of DBH.
i. EXAMPLE: The SRP radius of a twenty (20) inch diameter tree is
ten (10 feet.
ii.
E-5
E-6
2. Specimen Trees: Any tree which qualifies for special consideration for preservation
due to its size, type, condition, location or historical significance and which also
meets the minimum size criteria set forth below.
Pine Trees: 30-inch diameter or larger for trees in the Pinus (Pine)
genus.
Coniferous Trees: 20 diameter or larger for trees in the cedrus (deodar
cedar),Thuja (Arborvitae), or other ecologically similar
trees,
Overstory Trees: 30-inch diameter or larger for trees in the
Liquidambar (Sweetgum) or Liriodendron (Tulip poplar)
genus
20-inch diameter or larger for trees in the Fagus (Beech),
Nyssa (Tupelo), Diospyros (Persimmon), Sassafras
(Sassafras), or other ecologically similar trees
20-inch diameter or larger for Magnolia grandiflora
(Southern magnolia) and those cultivars that generally reach
a mature height over 40
24-inch (24?) diameter or larger for trees in all other
genera
Understory Trees: 8-inch (8?) diameter or larger.
10-inch diameter or larger for Oxydendron arboretum
(Sourwood).
E-7
3. Tree Density Calculation:
Trees located on the subject property or those found in the right-of way in front of the
property may count towards your required tree density or canopy coverage.
a. Standard Tree Density Calculation (130 inches per acre)
To calculate the Required Tree Density on all properties within the City use
the formula below:
SDF - EDF = RDF
Where:
SDF (Site Density Factor): The minimum tree density required to be
maintained on a developed property in inches per acre. The SDF is
calculated by multiplying the number of acres by 130 inches.
EDF (Existing Density Factor): The density of the existing trees to be
conserved measured in inches at DBH (Diameter at Breast Height)
RDF (Replacement Density Factor): Density in inches of new trees to
be planted on a property
Example A: 15,000 square foot lot (.34 acres)
SDF =.34 (acres) X 130 (inches) = 44.2 inches
With no existing trees:
44.2 (SDF)  0 (EDF) = 44.2 (RDF)
You will need to plant:
11  4 caliper trees or 22  2 caliper trees.
With 2 existing 15 trees:
44.2 (SDF)  30 (EDF) = 14.2 (RDF)
You will need to plant:
3  4 caliper trees and 1 - 2 caliper tree.
E-8
Example B: 4,000 square foot lot (.09 acres)
SDF =.09 (acres) X 130 (inches) = 11.7 inches
With no existing trees:
11.7 (SDF)  0 (EDF) = 11.7 (RDF)
You will need to plant:
3  4 caliper trees or 6  2 caliper trees. With 1 existing
8 tree:
11.7 (SDF)  8 (EDF) = 3.7 (RDF)
You will need to plant:
1  4 caliper tree or 2 - 2 caliper trees.
b. Alternate Tree Density Calculation (30% Canopy Coverage). This
calculation is only for detached single family residential properties and can
be accomplished through the preservation or planting of any combination of
Large, Medium, Small, or Very Small canopy trees as defined in the City
of Holly Springs Tree List:
To calculate the alternative tree density based upon canopy coverage use the
formula below:
SCC  ECC = RCC
Where:
SCC (Site Canopy Coverage): The minimum canopy coverage
required to be maintained on developed detached single family
residential properties in square feet. The SCC is calculated by
multiplying the area of the property in square feet by 30%.
E-9
ECC (Existing Canopy Coverage): The canopy coverage in square feet of the existing
trees to be conserved, obtained from the City of Holly Springs TreeList.
RDF (Replacement Canopy Coverage): The canopy coverage in square feet of the new
trees to be planted on a property, obtained from the City of Holly Springs Tree List.
Example A: 15,000 square foot lot with no existing trees
SCC = 15,000 (square feet) X .30 (30%) = 4,500 square feet
4,500 (SCC)  0 (ECC) = 4,500 (RCC)
You will need to plant:
3 large canopy trees: 1,600 (square feet) X 3 = 4,800 square feet, or
1 large canopy tree (1,600 square feet)
3 medium canopy trees (900 square feet X 3 = 2,700 square feet)
1 small canopy tree (400 square feet)
Total: 4700 square feet. (See Diagram)
E-10
Example B: 15,000 square foot lot with 2 existing medium canopy trees:
SCC = 15,000 (square feet) X .30 (30%) = 4,500 square feet
4,500 (SCC)  1,800 (ECC) = 2,700 (RCC)
You will need to plant:
1 large canopy tree (1,600 square feet)
1 medium canopy tree (900 square feet)
2 small canopy trees (150 square feet X 2 = 300 square feet)
Total 2800 square feet
Or
2 medium canopy trees (900 square feet X 2 = 1,800 square feet)
2 small canopy trees (400 square feet X 2 = 800 square feet)
1 very small canopy tree (150 square feet)
Total 2750 square feet (See Diagram)
E-11
Example C: 4,000 square foot lot with no existing trees:
SCC = 4,000 (square feet) X .30 (30%) = 1,200 square feet
1,200 (SCC)  0 (ECC) = 1,200 (RCC)
You will need to plant:
1 large canopy tree (1,600 square feet) X 1 = 1,600 square feet.
Or
1 medium canopy tree (900 square feet)
2 very small canopy trees (150 Square feet X 2 = 300 square feet)
Total 1200 square feet (See Diagram)
E-12
Example D: 4,000 square foot lot with 1 existing medium canopy tree SCC = 4,000 (square
feet) X .30 (30%) = 1,200 square feet
1,200 (SCC)  900 (ECC) = 300 (RCC)
You will need to plant:
1 small canopy tree (400 square feet)
Or
2 very small canopy trees (150 Square feet X 2 = 300 square feet)
(See Diagram)
E-13
E-14
Tree Removal Requirements
The City of Holly Springs Tree Removal Permitting Process is listed below:
1. Detached Single Family Residential:
a. A tree permit is required for the removal of all trees that are alive.
b. A tree removal permit is not required for dead trees or trees that have
already fallen. It is recommended to take photos of these trees for your
records.
c. Replacement trees may be required.
2. Commercial and Attached or Multi-Family Residential:
a. All commercial properties are required to apply for a tree removal permit for
the removal of any trees dead or alive.
b. Replacement trees may be required.
3. Emergency Removals:
a. Emergency removals will be handled on a case by case basis.
i. During normal business hours please contact the City Arborist by phone
at (770)345-5536.
ii. If an emergency tree removal must occur during non-business hours,
provide the City Arborist with a voice message as soon as possible. Take
pictures documenting the removal and submit them to the City Arborist as
soon as possible but no later than the next business day.
b. If a tree is in imminent danger of falling and causing damage to person or
property a permit is not required. Examples include broken trunks and
uprooting trees. Please schedule the removal, take photographs, and provide
notification to the City including address and date removal is going to take
place.
4. Storm-Damaged Tree Removals:
a. From time to time a storm will pass through Holly Springs that will topple
trees. In this instance the City may decide to suspend tree removal
requirements. If this happens please check the City of Holly Springs website
(www. hollyspringsga.us) for information.
E-15
Tree Care
1. Planting:
a. A properly planted tree has a better chance of survival.
2. Mulching:
a. Organic non-synthetic mulch should be applied to the rooting zone of all trees
and be refreshed as needed.
b. Mulch helps to keep the soil moist over the roots, minimizes weeds, and
provides nutrients as the mulch breaks down.
c. Mulch should be placed at a depth of 2-4 inches and should never touch the
trunk of a tree.
E-16
3. Pruning:
a. Trees should be pruned to remove dead, dying, or diseased branches.
b. Shaped for aesthetic reasons.
c. Provide clearance for pedestrians, vehicles, structures, or light.
The basic pruning of trees should follow the Three Cut Method. First cut should be made
at location A. Second cut should be made along line B. Final cut should be made along
line C-D. Never cut along line X.
E-17
4. Watering
a. Newly planted trees should be watered until fully established with drip
irrigation or watering bags. If watering bags are used manufacturers
recommendations should be used to determine the size of the watering bag and
the schedule to fill the watering bags.
b. Established trees should be watered during times of drought or lower than
normal rainfall. During droughts please make sure to follow local water
usage regulations.
c. Watering should simulate at least 1 of rainfall per week and be long and
slow so the water can infiltrate through the soil to the roots of the trees.
E-18

Springs Zoning Ordinance.
6. Maintenance
a. Two full growing seasons after the date of the inspection of new tree installations,
the City Zoning Administrator will inspect all trees on the project site. Any trees
planted to meet the required Tree Density Factor, which are dead or near death
must be replaced. Trees preserved to meet the required site density, which are
dead or near death at the time of the maintenance inspection must be replaced if
there is evidence that the demise of such trees was due to construction injury.
b. Trees, which are used to meet the density requirements for this Ordinance, shall be
maintained for twenty-four (24) months after the date of the final inspection. The
property owner shall maintain the required tree density.
c. It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property subject
to this Ordinance to maintain said property in good condition so as to present a
healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. Property shall be kept free from refuse and

7. Irrigation Requirements
a. Irrigation is to provide for landscaped areas fronting multi-family, commercial and
industrial developments. Irrigation is also to be provided along all road frontages for
these types of developments.
b. Irrigation systems can be beneficial in efficiently adding water to the landscape.
Landscaped areas shall be irrigated by the use of an automatic irrigation system with
controllers. The water demand of lawn areas is significantly greater than the water
demand of most trees, shrubbery, or ground cover areas. Wherever feasible, sprinkler
head irrigating lawns or other head water demand landscape areas shall be circuited
so that they are on a separate zone or zones for those irrigating trees, shrubbery or
other reduced water requirement areas.
E-24
c. Automatically controlled irrigation systems shall be operated by an irrigation
controller that is capable of watering high water requirement areas on a different
schedule from low water requirements areas.

planting beds. Low trajectory heads or low volume water distributing devices shall
be used. Irrigation controllers shall be capable of irrigating grass and tree-shrub zones
on different schedules.
E-25
Tree List
The City of Holly Springs Tree List is intended to support the Unified Development Code,
site planning and design activities for tree conservation and establishment, and tree
maintenance planning and decision-making. In the list trees are arranged alphabetically
by the trees common name with the genus listed first. For example, red maple is
listed as Maple, Red (maple is the genus name). The Latin name is also listed for more
definitive species identification. In some cases, the commonly planted variety or cultivar
of the species has also been included apart from the species. This is a recommended tree
list and not a required tree list.

CANOPY AREA FOR DEVELOPMENT CODE
Square Feet of Canopy The total area projection of the crown onto the ground
in square feet as typically achieved in urban situations
with less than optimal growing conditions.
Parking Lot Canopy Trees approved for planting in parking lots.
1 = trees that will project significant shade, intercept
enough water, substantially filter out pollutants, and survive
the conditions within a parking area to the extent they could
be considered a "canopy" tree.
2 = the same as 1, except these trees are ONLY appropriate
for large, expanded tree islands or landscape strips, swales,
or moist soil conditions with plenty of rooting space.
Canopy Size Category Very Small - 150 square feet with a 15-foot crown diameter

F = Fast: 2-1/2 to 3+ feet/year
Average Life Span The average life span (useful service life) of the species when
growing under average urban conditions. A tree is at the end
of its useful service life when its risk of failure becomes
unacceptable and cannot be improved or when the tree is no
longer an asset due to its appearance or condition.
