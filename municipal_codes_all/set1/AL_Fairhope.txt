PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the Ordinances of the City of Fairhope, Alabama, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the tenth section of chapter 17 is 17-10. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

(Ord. No. 1129, 7-9-01) 
Sec. 7-17. - Traffic requirements. 
    Before the building official issues any building permit for any building or structure, other than a single-family residential building or structure, the applicant for such permit shall demonstrate to the building official, as a part of the building permit application process, compliance with the following: 
(a)  If any state right-of-way or any improvement thereon is proposed to be changed or modified, a detailed highway improvements plan, with the written approval of the responsible official of the Alabama Highway Department, showing all existing features within the rights-of-way and all proposed changes, including, but not limited to, changes in traffic patterns, markings, signs, curbs and barriers, neutral zones, signals, warnings, plantings and landscaping. There shall be submitted with and as a part of the plan a written statement setting forth means proposed for traffic control and safety during construction and for restoration of the site. All of the foregoing shall also apply to rights-of-way controlled by the county, except that the county engineer's written approval shall be provided as a part of the building permit application. 
(b)  If, in the reasonable judgment of the building official, the building that is the subject of a building permit application will have a material effect on the traffic in the area surrounding the site, the building official shall require the building permit applicant to submit and include as a part of its application trip generation data showing the projected average daily traffic ("ADT") in a 24-hour period and projected peak-hour traffic generated by the development. Peak hour traffic shall generally be the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. for morning and 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. for the evening and including the consecutive sixty-minute segment in which traffic counts are projected to occur. In instances where the proposed application will have peak periods that differ from the general peak periods above, the building official may require that the analysis be conducted for the alternative peak periods. Trip generation data shall be based on the most recent edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineer's Trip Generation Manual or actual data about similar developments in Alabama with the same types of uses and site conditions. A traffic study shall be required for all building permit applications that will generate an ADT count of two thousand (2,000) trips or more, or which will generate one hundred (100) trips or more during any peak hour period. An agent selected by the building official and paid for by the building permit applicant shall perform the traffic study. The traffic study shall include the following data along with an analysis of the data: 
(1)  Estimates of trip generation for the proposed development showing projected inbound and outbound vehicle trips for morning and evening peak periods and a typical hour not in the peak period; 
(2)  Projected traffic impact and trip distribution on existing and planned streets within the development and areas likely to be impacted by the development; 
(3)  Assignment of trips generated by the proposed development on existing and planned streets within the development and areas likely to be impacted by the development; 
(4)  Intersection turning movements and traffic counts on all existing and planned intersections likely to be impacted by the proposed development; and 
(5)  Potential mitigating measures or trip reduction options. 
(c)  The traffic study shall be used by the building official to determine what on-site and off-site street or traffic improvements may be necessary due to the construction of the building that is the subject of the application. The building official may condition the approval of the building permit application on the applicant paying for or constructing those improvements or portions of improvements that are needed due to the traffic impact of the building that is the subject of the permit application. 
(d)  In the event the applicant is seeking multiple building permits for one (1) parcel of property or adjacent parcels of property as part of a common plan of development, the building official may take into consideration the potential cumulative effect of said multiple buildings in connection with the enforcement of the requirements of this section 7-17. 
(e)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section 7-17 to the contrary, no certificate of occupancy will be issued for the building that is the subject of such application until the improvements required by the building official as a condition to the building permit, if any, are completed. 
(f)  In the event the property on which the proposed building or structure that is the subject of the building permit application has been a part of a previous subdivision that was approved by the Fairhope Planning Commission and/or the Fairhope City Council, as applicable, and, in connection with said subdivision, compliance was made with the traffic regulations of the Fairhope Subdivision Regulations, which are currently codified at subsection C.1.h. of article IV of said subdivision regulations, the building official shall take into consideration said compliance with the subdivision regulations in addressing the applicant's compliance with this section 7-17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the building official determines in accordance with subparagraph (b) hereof that the building that is the subject of a building permit application will have a material effect on the traffic in the area surrounding the site, then compliance with this section 7-17 shall be a condition to the issuance of a building permit. 
(Ord. No. 1281, § 2, 11-28-05) 
Sec. 7-18. - Stormwater requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. These stormwater standards shall implement the master plan for the physical development of the city by setting the location, character and extent of open spaces and facilities for waterways and stormwater runoff, discharge, retention and detention.

Where it can be reasonably anticipated that additional quantity or velocity of runoff from development of a project will overload existing downstream drainage facilities, approval shall be withheld until there is submitted to the building official a plan to mitigate damage to downstream property which would or might result from the building permit application under consideration. Down stream drainage structures should be considered when sizing detention outfall structures, with proof of this submitted to the building official. The hydraulic elevations resulting from the channel detention shall not adversely affect adjacent properties. 
(3)  Additional engineering plans and calculations. 
a.  In every case where new streets are to be constructed, and in cases where the proposed building that is the subject of the application will have frontage only upon existing rights-of-way and there exists in the opinion of the building official the potential for damage from uncontrolled stormwater runoff, the applicant shall include in its plans the design and calculations required for adequate control of stormwater. 
b.  For projects not exceeding two hundred (200) acres, routing calculations shall be in legible tabulated form. Proof of adequacy of volume of retention and sizing computations for low flow structures shall be submitted. For projects exceeding two hundred (200) acres, the applicant shall provide detailed, documented verification of adequacy of design.

"ENGINEER'S CERTIFICATE 
I, the undersigned, a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Alabama holding Certificate Number ____________ , hereby certify that I have reviewed the design herein which was done under my direct control and supervision and that, to the best of my professional knowledge and to the best of my belief, conforms to the requirements of Section 7-18 of the City of Fairhope Municipal Code and to all other rules, regulations, laws, and ordinances applicable to my design. 
____________ 
Project Engineer 
____________ 
Date 
____________ 
Name of Project to which this Certificate Applies 
Plans which are certified consist of Page ____________ thru ____________ , each of which bears my seal and signature." 
(d)  Flow control. 
(1)  Scope of design. All proposed projects shall be provided with adequate stormwater drainage facilities. The applicant shall provide a design adequate to control stormwater runoff volume and velocity, based upon a 25-year, 24-hour storm event. In general, the applicant shall use design storm criteria based on the site-specific conditions that relate to protection of life and property. Culverts shall generally accommodate a 25-year storm frequency under arterial roadways; bridges shall accommodate storm frequency of fifty (50) years. When deemed necessary, the building official may require a storm frequency design as great as one hundred (100) years. 
(2)  Design standards and calculations. The method of determining stormwater runoff, plans and designs shall be based on principles of good engineering practice and the following standards: 
a.  Calculations shall be based on the Rational Method (Q = cia) for small basins, up to one hundred (100) acres, where: 
Q = estimated peak discharge in cubic feet per second 
c = coefficient of runoff (from table below) 
l = rainfall intensity, inches per hour, for a design storm derived from the time of concentration 
t c = time of concentration in minutes, from figure 4-13 of the Alabama Department of Transportation of Hydraulic Manual, attached as Appendix D to the city's subdivision regulations. 
a = drainage area in acres 
Recommended values for "c" may be found in table 4-2 of the Alabama Department of Transportation Hydraulics Manual, attached as Appendix E to the city's subdivision regulations. It is recommended that the intensity, "l" be obtained from the Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curve for Mobile produced by the National Weather Bureau. 
b.  When the proposed project lies within a large watershed where flows from upstream drainage areas are passing through the proposed development, a rainfall-runoff model such as the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) technical release 20 (TR-20) should be used to calculate offsite flow. Flow should be calculated using a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall, the depth of which can be obtained from SCS Technical Release 55 (TR-55). This flow shall be taken into account when designing detention outfall structures if the upstream flow passes through the proposed detention pond. The effects of (and on) upstream and downstream ponds in the watershed shall be analyzed. 
c.  All proposed conduits or channels shall be of sufficient capacity to accommodate potential runoff from developed area, including the entire upstream drainage area. The applicant shall include in its submittals evidence that it has included in its design the tributary areas. If an existing channel runs through a proposed project, the applicant must consider this flow when designing detention and outfall structure. 
d.  In general, inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across any intersection, nor for a distance of more than six hundred (600) feet in the gutter. When calculations indicate that gutter capacities are at maximum, catch basins shall be used to intercept the flow at that point. 
e.  Open channels and ditches shall be so designed as not to create a traffic hazard or to cause erosion. The minimum slope for paved ditches shall be one-half (0.5) per cent and for nonpaved ditches shall be one (1) per cent. Maximum design flow velocities shall conform to the current edition of the Alabama Highway Department Hydraulics Manual. 
f.  Cleanout access shall be provided at a maximum spacing of three hundred (300) feet for pipes twenty-four (24) inches or less in diameter and four hundred (400) feet for pipes exceeding twenty-four (24) inches. Cleanouts shall also be provided at each change in line and grade. 
g.  Concrete box culverts shall be designed and constructed according to requirements of the Alabama Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Highway Constructions, current, and the Alabama Department of Transportation Special Standard Highway Drawings. 
(3)  Site facilities. 
a.  The applicant shall be required to carry away, by pipe or open channel, any spring or surface water existing prior to or as a result of the project. Adequate provisions shall be made within the project for required drainage facilities. 
b.  Where a public stormwater system is available, the applicant shall be required to connect its facilities thereto. If no public outlet exists, the applicant shall recommend means to adequately dispose of stormwater runoff. 
c.  The storm and sanitary sewer plans shall be made prior to other utility plans. 
d.  The stormwater system shall be separate from and independent of any sanitary sewer system. 
(4)  Conformity with other standards. All drainage facilities shall be constructed in conformity with state specifications and all other state and federal laws and regulations. 
(5)  Floodprone areas. 
a.  Low lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or overflowing shall be included in the drainage and shall not be available for improvements except as specifically authorized by the city's flood control ordinance. 
b.  Low areas subject to periodic inundation and areas subject to excessive erosion shall not be developed or subdivided unless and until the building official may establish that: the nature of the land use proposed would not tend to be damaged appreciably by water; the area may be filled or improved in such a manner as to prevent periodic inundation; minimum floor elevations may be established such as to prevent damage to buildings or structures; and there is adequate provision to eliminate such flooding. 
(6)  Lands outside the city. Within the extra-territorial police jurisdiction of the City of Fairhope, all engineering plans shall be subject to the more restrictive requirement of these provisions or of Baldwin County's Stormwater Management Plan. In those areas, the county engineer's review shall be completed and his certificate of review shall accompany all plans submitted to the building official. The following outline is provided to help insure that certain critical elements of design are in compliance with the objectives of design: 
a.  Volume of retention for entire project. 
b.  Tributary (Q) peak runoff to basin. 
c.  Balanced maximum outflow rate from low flow structure. 
d.  Ratios of inflow to outflow (differential rates). 
e.  Sizing of overflow facilities. 
f.  Stability of dikes. 
g.  Safety features. 
h.  Maintenance features. 
(e)  Erosion control. 
(1)  Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas shall be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during periods of exposure. All land disturbing activities shall be planned so as to minimize off-site sedimentation damage. 
(2)  No grading or earth moving operations shall commence until erosion and sedimentation control measures shall have been implemented. 
(3)  All disturbed areas shall be stabilized as quickly as is practicable with permanent vegetation and erosion/sediment control measures. The duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a minimum. 
(4)  Detention ponds shall be stabilized by means of grassing, sodding, erosion control netting, or a combination thereof. Sediment shall be removed from the pond prior to acceptance, and any disturbed areas shall be regrassed. The use of red clay as a means of stabilizing detention ponds is prohibited. 
(5)  Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be provided to protect exposed high-risk erosion areas during development. 
(6)  When the increase in peak rates and velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land disturbing activity is likely to cause damaging accelerated erosion of the receiving channel, plans shall include measures to control velocity and rate of release so as to minimize damage to the channel. 
(7)  No land disturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake, natural watercourse or adjacent property unless a buffer zone is provided along the boundary thereof to confine visible siltation and to prevent erosion; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not prevent such activity undertaken as a part of the construction of such lake or watercourse channel. 
(8)  The angle for graded slopes and fills shall not exceed that which can be retained by vegetation cover or other adequate erosion control methods. Provision shall be made for planting or otherwise protecting slopes within the shortest possible time from exposure thereof. 
(9)  Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices shall provide control from the calculated post-development peak runoff. Runoff rates and computations may be calculated from procedures contained in the "National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices" and shall be based on rainfall data published by the National Weather Service for the area and/or official local records. 
(10)  The applicant shall provide for permanent protection of on-site or adjacent stream banks and channels from the erosive effects of increased velocity and volume of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbing activities. 
(f)  Detention and retention facilities. 
(1)  A combination of storage and controlled release shall be required for road construction, nonresidential projects of one (1) acre or more, multifamily residential projects of five (5) acres or more, and single-family projects of ten (10) acres or more. (The effective acreage for a project is not limited to a fractional part of the total concept; even though developed in phases, it is the total area of the conceptual plans which governs. Storage and controlled release facilities may be required on smaller projects if it is determined in the building official's discretion that the intensity of the project could cause offsite stormwater flow impacts during or after development. In all cases, post-development release rates shall not exceed that of predevelopment. Design shall be such as to insure that detention facilities will survive overtopping occurring for any reason, including clogging of controlled outlets or the 100-year storm event. Detention facilities shall have controlled release structures that closely match predevelopment runoff rates of the two-year through 100-year storm events. Calculations and design of the structures shall show that the outfall structures have been designed for staged release rates (two-year, ten-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year). 
(2)  Such facilities shall be owned, operated and maintained by the owner of the property that is the subject of the building permit application and shall not be accepted for maintenance by the city or any other governing body. The burden shall be on the applicant and its engineer to provide evidence in support of any proposal to alter or modify the requirement for detention. 
(3)  Detention facilities shall be provided with obvious and effective control structures. Plan view, sections and details of structure shall be included in submittals. Sizing of the low flow pipe shall be by inlet control or hydraulic gradient requirements.

If the purchaser refuses or fails to appoint a referee, as provided in subsection (c), the purchaser shall forfeit his or her claim to compensation for the improvements. The failure of the referees or either of them to act or to appoint an umpire shall not operate to impair or forfeit the right of either the proposed redemptioner or the purchaser in the premises. In the event of failure without fault of the parties to affect an award, the appropriate court shall proceed to ascertain the true value of the permanent improvements and enforce the redemption accordingly. 
(e)  In addition to all other payments provided hereunder, the proposed redemptioner shall also pay interest to the purchaser on the value of all permanent improvements computed from the date the improvements were made at the rate of 12 percent per annum through the date of the payment.

ARTICLE VII. - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1398, §§ I-XIV, adopted Aug. 10, 2009, repealed Art. VII and enacted a new article as set out herein. The former Art. VII, §§ 7-151-7-158, pertained to land-disturbing activities, soil erosion and sedimentation control and derived from Ord. No. 1000, §§ 1-8, adopted Sept. 23, 1996. 
Cross reference- Flood damage control, § 7-11; coastal protection and development, § 7-51 et seq.; construction site maintenance, § 7-111 et seq.; erosion and silt deposits, § 7-126. 

Sec. 7-151. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as and called the Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1398, § I, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 7-152. - Jurisdiction. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all lands within the permitting jurisdiction of the City of Fairhope. 
(Ord. No. 1398, § II, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 7-153. - Purpose. 
    During the construction process, soil is most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches, dredging of watercourses, and causes air quality impacts when sediment particles become entrapped in the atmosphere. In addition, clearing and grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation. Vegetation holds the soil in place, holds and filters stormwater, provides habitat for terrestrial and aquatic life, and provides a healthy living environment for Fairhope citizens. 
    As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding and regulating the design, construction, use, and maintenance of land disturbances in the City of Fairhope. 
(Ord. No. 1398, § III, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 7-154. - Definitions. 
    Alabama Handbook means the most current issue of Alabama Handbook for Erosion Control, Sediment Control and Stormwater Management on Construction Sites and Urban Areas (Alabama Handbook) - Volume 1 and Volume 2 from the Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee provide guidance for the prevention or minimization of problems related to erosion, sedimentation and stormwater management on construction sites and erodible urban areas. The Alabama Handbook provides a basis for developing sound plans implementing appropriate measures (BMPs). 
    Best management practice (BMP). An action which landowners, developers, and/or contractors can take to reduce the impact of human activity on the natural environment. BMPs to control pollutant discharges from land disturbance can be divided into two (2) main categories: structural and nonstructural measures to minimize quantity and maximize quality of stormwater runoff from a construction site. BMPs can include sediment and erosion control measures, good housekeeping measures, and stormwater measures. Erosion and sediment controls can each be further described as permanent controls and/or temporary controls. BMPs shall meet or exceed recognized effective industry standards as outlined in the Alabama Handbook . 
    BMP minimum requirements. Those basic and standard practices, devices and/or policies as set forth and approved by the city enforcement officers, to serve as a minimal (but not inclusive) level of protection on all sites requiring a land disturbance permit, including single-family residential. 
    Buffer. An undisturbed area along a wetland, shoreline or watercourse where development and/or redevelopment is prohibited by any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation. The vegetated target for the buffer shall be undisturbed native vegetation. 
    Control Measures.

ARTICLE IX. - LAND DISTURBANCE PERMITS FOR ACTIVITIES THAT MAY AFFECT WETLANDS 

Sec. 7-191. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council of the city (the "city council") determines that many of the wetlands (hereinafter defined) within the city and the permitting jurisdiction (hereinafter defined) have already been lost due to drainage or fill. The loss of wetlands has increased downstream water pollution, flooding, and erosion and resulted in the loss of wildlife habitat. This article is being adopted to conserve and protect remaining wetlands and other water resources. 
    Wetlands provide the following functions: 
(a)  Flood conveyance and storage; 
(b)  Stormwater detention (especially in the case of extraordinary rainfall events) and stormwater purification; 
(c)  Living, breeding, nesting and feeding environments for many forms of wildlife and waterfowl; 
(d)  Linkage between aquatic systems; 
(e)  Water treatment and pollution abatement through biological degradation and chemical oxidation; 
(f)  Buffer (hereinafter defined) areas which filter additional nonpoint pollution; 
(g)  Nursery grounds and sanctuaries for fish; and 
(h)  Recreation areas for fishing, boating, hiking, bird watching, photography and other recreational uses. 
    Further loss of wetland quality and quantity endangers the public health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the city and those residing within the permitting jurisdiction.

(Ord. No. 1370, § 12, 10-13-08) 
Sec. 7-203. - Wetland management plans. 
    Permit applicants shall submit a written wetland management plan to the department as a part of any permit application. Such management plans may include the procedures and timing of the proposed project, water level manipulation, removal of exotic species, replanting (if necessary) and other active management activities over time. It may be combined with a compensatory mitigation plan as provided in section 7-204 of this article. The plan shall be consistent with the following: 
(a)  The plan shall describe any long term management proposed for the site to minimize or compensate for project impacts, how this management is to be carried out, and who will undertake the management. 
(b)  Site development shall be fitted to the topography and soil so as to create the least potential for vegetation loss and site disturbance. 
(c)  Vegetation and soil removal shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary for the development of the site. 
(d)  Vegetation indigenous to the site or plant community shall be restored in areas affected by construction activities. Temporary vegetation and/or erosion control matting, sufficient to stabilize the soil, may be required on all disturbed areas as needed to prevent soil erosion. New planting shall be given sufficient water, fertilizer and protection to insure reestablishment. 
(Ord. No. 1370, § 13, 10-13-08) 
Sec. 7-204. - Compensatory mitigation. 
    Permit applicants shall submit a written compensatory mitigation plan developed by qualified professionals reasonably acceptable to the department to achieve no net loss of wetland functions, values, and acreage to meet the goals and standards of this article including conditions attached to the issuance of a wetland permit. Compensatory mitigation may take the form of wetland and/or buffer area restoration, creation, or enhancement. Such plans shall include design, implementation, maintenance, and monitoring elements. A compensatory mitigation plan shall: 
(a)  Describe any residual impacts to functions, values, or acreage; 
(b)  Identify riparian areas, wetlands, and watercourse areas that are to be protected and those that will be impacted; 
(c)  Provide a plan for compensating for impacts; 
(d)  Describe proposed habitat manipulation activities in detail; 
(e)  Provide replacement of affected vegetation with appropriate plant species in ratios which will result in simulation of pre-alteration vegetation within five (5) years; 
(f)  Specify construction methods; 
(g)  Provide for periodic monitoring of mitigation; and 
(h)  Provide for the posting of performance bonds or other financial assurances of performance. 
    In general, compensatory mitigation shall be onsite and in kind. However, the department may allow use of offsite and out of kind mitigation including the use of mitigation banks if such use will have net ecological benefits, will not cause nuisances, will not violate other laws, and will not result in fragmentation of the wetland ecological system. Use of mitigation banks will be allowed to compensate for impacts only where onsite measures are, in addition, applied to insure that flooding, water pollution, erosion, and other problems do not occur at the original site. Where feasible, mitigation projects shall be completed prior to activities that will disturb wetlands. In other cases, mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the activity. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all compensatory mitigation shall (1) to the extent reasonably possible, be conducted within the watershed in which such wetlands are being filled, damaged, diminished, destroyed, or otherwise altered, and (2) in any event, be conducted within the permitting jurisdiction of the city as in effect from time to time. 
    There shall be no introduction of any plant or wildlife into a mitigation project for any wetland or wetland buffer which is not native to the area unless authorized by a state or federal permit or approval. 
    In general the following mitigation ratios shall be provided for restoration, creation, and enhancement of wetlands: 2:1 for restoration, 4:1 for creation, and 6:1 for enhancement. The department may increase the mitigation ratios if uncertainties exist with regard to the success of the proposed mitigation, a significant period of time will elapse between impact and replication of wetland functions, the mitigation will result in reduced wetland functions relative to the wetland being impacted, or the impact was an unauthorized impact. the department may decrease mitigation ratios if the proposed mitigation has a high likelihood of success, the proposed mitigation will provide functions and values significantly greater than the wetland being impacted, or the proposed mitigation is conducted in advance of the impact and has been shown to be successful. 
    In evaluating the adequacy of proposed compensatory mitigation, the department shall consider: 
(a)  The risk of failure of the proposed mitigation project based upon the difficulty with which this type of wetland is restored, created, or enhanced, the experience and expertise of the individual or individuals proposing to carry out the mitigation, the proposed buffer and other protection measures, and the proposed management, monitoring and maintenance; 
(b)  The societal importance of wetland/buffer functions provided by the mitigation plan in contrast with the societal importance of the functions of the original wetland/buffer; 
(c)  Whether the proposed mitigation will require long term maintenance and, if so, the adequacy and direct responsibility of any proposed maintenance; 
(d)  The need for long term monitoring and whether such monitoring will be provided; and 
(e)  Whether there will be offsite impacts of the proposed mitigation such as flooding on adjacent property. 
(Ord. No. 1370, § 14, 10-13-08) 
Sec. 7-205. - Nonconforming uses. 
    All uses and activities that were lawful before the passage of the ordinance from which this article derives but which do not conform with the provisions of the ordinance, may be continued but may not be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered without a permit as provided above. Nonconforming uses including, but not limited to, buildings, shall not be enlarged or expanded to further encroach into any wetland. Nonconforming activity which has been discontinued for more than one year shall not be resumed. Any nonconforming structure which has been destroyed or damaged for more than fifty (50) percent of its value by flooding, wind, fire, or other natural or man-made force may be rebuilt only with issuance of a permit in conformity with the provisions of this article.

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1453, §§ 1-14, adopted July 25, 2011, and effective Jan. 1, 2012, repealed Art. V and enacted a new article as set out herein. The former Art. V, §§ 8-66-8-76, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1335, §§ 1-11, adopted July 9, 2007. 

Sec. 8-66. - Purpose. 
(a)  Purpose of regulations. The purpose of this article is to place responsibility on the alarm user to prevent, by use of appropriate mechanical, electrical, or other means, false burglar alarms. 
(b)  Scope of regulations. This article will apply to areas within the Fairhope police and fire jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 1453, § 1, 7-25-11) 
Sec. 8-67. - Definitions. 
    In this article, the following terms and phrases shall have the following meanings: 
(a)  Alarm company means any person engaged in selling, leasing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving, installing or monitoring any alarm system or causing any alarm system to be sold, leased, maintained, serviced, repaired, altered, replaced, moved or installed in, or on, any building, structure or facility. An alarm company and/or alarm monitoring company shall be properly licensed in accordance with Alabama Statutes. An alarm company shall have an appropriate occupational license pursuant to the Code of Alabama and the Code of Ordinances for the City of Fairhope. 
(b)  Alarm user means any person or other entity that owns, possesses, controls, occupies, or manages any premises as defined below. 
(c)  Burglar alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, arranged to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other activity requiring urgent attention and to which the police department may reasonably be expected to respond, but does not include fire alarms or alarms installed in motor vehicles. If a fire alarm system is connected to a burglar alarm system, this article shall not apply to false alarms that the alarm user proves were generated by the fire alarm portion of the system. 
(d)  False burglar alarm means a signal from a burglar alarm system that elicits a response by the police when no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response exists. This definition includes signals activated by negligence, accident, mechanical failure, and electrical failure; signals activated intentionally in non-emergency situations; and signals for which the actual cause of activation is unknown. It is a rebuttable presumption that a burglar alarm is false if personnel responding from the police department do not discover any evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity, or other emergency after following normal police procedures in investigating the incident. An alarm is not false if the alarm user proves that (1) an individual activated the alarm based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response existed; (2) the alarm system was activated by lightning or an electrical surge that caused physical damage to the system, as evidenced by the testimony of a licensed alarm system contractor who conducted an on-site inspection and personally observed the damage to the system or (3) if the user experienced a power outage of four (4) or more hours, causing the alarm to activate upon restoration of power, as evidenced by written documentation provided by the power company or other applicable provider. 
(e)  Premises means the building or structure or portion of a building or structure upon which is installed or maintained a burglar alarm system. 
(Ord. No. 1453, § 2, 7-25-11) 
Sec. 8-68. - Registration of alarm system and fee. 
(a)  Registration of burglar alarm systems. All burglar alarm systems which operate at locations within the police and fire jurisdiction shall be registered with the Fairhope Police Department by the user. The user shall complete and submit to the police department an initial registration or an annual registration renewal with the appropriate fee. All systems must be registered on or before January 1, 2012. Initial registration shall be necessary to register any system which is not currently registered with the department or upon a change in the user of an alarm which may occur anytime throughout the year. 
(b)  Registration fee. Effective with registrations beginning on or after January 1, 2012, there shall be a registration fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for all alarm registrations that result from a false burglar alarm response and two-week grace period in which the owner fails to register. Separate alarm systems require separate registrations. The registration period will be for one (1) year. 
(c)  Change in registration information. In the event of a change in any of the information required as part of the initial or annual registration, the user shall notify the Fairhope Police Department of the change. An updated registration shall be filed within ten (10) days of any change. 
(d)  Application of funds . Funds collected under this section shall be applied to the operational costs and enforcement of this article, to reduce the number of false alarms received by the Fairhope Police Department, and to reduce the time spent by the police department handling false alarm calls. 
(Ord. No. 1453, § 3, 7-25-11) 
Sec. 8-69. - Required equipment in a burglar alarm.

(Ord. No. 1453, § 4, 7-25-11) 
Sec. 8-70. - Alarm companies responsibilities. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of any licensed person selling and/or monitoring any alarm system to provide the user with the registration form and the City of Fairhope False Alarm Ordinance information form. The registration form provided to the user shall include the said person's name, address, and State of Alabama burglar alarm contractor's license number as required on the registration form. An alarm company may not charge a customer a fee, other than the required registration fee, to register any alarm system with the Fairhope Police Department. A copy of the current/valid contractor's license must be on file with the police department. 
(b)  Any person within the Fairhope police jurisdiction which sells burglar alarm systems to a potential user must include a copy of the City of Fairhope False Alarm Ordinance information form and registration form and with each system sold. 
(c)  Any person testing and/or working on an alarm system shall promptly cancel any activation so that police will not be dispatched. 
(Ord. No. 1453, § 5, 7-25-11) 
Sec. 8-71. - Alarm verification calls required. 
    All residential or commercial intrusion/burglar alarms, that have central monitoring, must have a central monitoring verification call made to the premises generating the alarm signal, prior to alarm monitor personnel contacting the Fairhope Police Department for dispatch.

Alarm monitoring companies will make available to the police department upon request, records providing proof that the monitoring company made the verification calls.

However, police will not cite the company for failure to meet the ten-minute criterion if notification of a false alarm is received before an officer arrives on the scene. Alarm monitoring companies will make available to the police department records providing proof that the police department was contacted within the ten-minute criterion. An emergency line has been provided by the police department to call in and/or cancel panic or holdup type alarms. Use of this line for non-emergency alarm calls is prohibited.

Sec. 8-73. - False burglar alarms prohibited.

ARTICLE VIII. - SMOKING IN WORK PLACES AND PUBLIC PLACES 

Sec. 8-132. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the "City of Fairhope Smoke free Air Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 1311, § 8-1, 8-14-06) 
Sec. 8-133. - Findings and intent. 
    Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (Nd), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (WC), August 1999.) 
    The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.) 
    A study of hospital admissions for acute inyocardial infarction in Helena, Montana before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smoke free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease. (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M. Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study," British Medical Journal 328: 9 77-980, April 24, 2004.) 
    Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) 
    The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9. ) 
    The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not: eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. (Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, 1986.) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Indoor air facts no. 5: environmental tobacco smoke," Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.) 
    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infraction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is non linear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one (1) or two (2) cigarettes a day, and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal 328:980-983, April 24, 2004.) 
    A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) per cent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002). 
    Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
    Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smoke free. Creation of smoke free workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A. & Smith, L."The effect of ordinances requiring smoke free restaurants on restaurant sales in the United States", American Journal of Public Health, 37:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, CM., "The economic impact of smoke free workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001.) 
    Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures cause economic damage to businesses. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
    The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a positive danger to health, and a material public nuisance. 
    Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this article are: 
(1)  to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and 
(2)  to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke free air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

(h)  If a judgment is entered against a defendant upon appeal, the circuit court shall remand the defendant to the municipal authorities in accordance with the judgement of the circuit court, unless, when the judgment is for fine and costs only, the judgment is paid or a judgment is conferred therefor in favor of the city with sureties or as otherwise provided for convictions under state law. 
(i)  Upon receipt of payment of fines and costs upon appeals, the clerk of the circuit court shall within thirty (30) days pay ninety (90) per cent of such fines and forfeitures, and ten (10) per cent of the costs, to the city. The circuit court clerk shall be liable on such clerk's bond for such fines and costs plus a penalty of five (5) per cent per month for default in such payments. 
(j)  From the judgment of the circuit court, the city, in a case holding invalid an ordinance, or the defendant, in any case, may appeal to the court of criminal appeals in like manner as in cases of appeals from convictions of violation of the criminal laws of the state. If the appeal is taken by the city, it shall not be required to give surety for the costs of the appeal. When taken by the defendant, the defendant may give bail with sufficient sureties, conditioned that such defendant will appear and abide by the judgment of the appellate court, and failing to give bail such defendant must be committed to the city jail; but such defendant may give such bail at any time pending the appeal. When an appeal is taken by the defendant and bail is given pending the appeal, and the judgment of conviction is affirmed or the appeal is dismissed, the defendant is bound by the undertaking of bail to surrender to the city authorities within fifteen (15) days from the date of such affirmance or dismissal, and if such defendant shall fail to do so, the clerk of the circuit court from which the appeal is taken, upon motion of the city, must endorse the bail bond forfeited, and a writ or writs of arrest must be issued by the clerk to the sheriff. Upon arrest the defendant shall be delivered to the city authorities and the sentence must without delay be carried out as if no appeal had been taken. If bail is forfeited as herein provided, a conditional judgment must be rendered by the court in favor of the city and the same proceedings had thereon for the city as is authorized by law to be had in the name of the state in state cases.

--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 862, §§ 1-5, adopted Aug. 27, 1990, pertaining to municipal offense tickets, did not specify manner of codification, but has been designated as Art. II, §§ 10-26-10-30, by the editor. 

Sec. 10-26. - Issuance generally. 
    Violations of the municipal laws, set out in section 10-29 as may be amended from time to time, shall be punished by the issuance of a municipal offense ticket as further set out in this article. 
(Ord. No. 862, § 1, 8-27-90) 
Sec. 10-27. - Schedule of fines established; procedure for payment. 
(a)  The schedule of fines, set out in section 10-29, which does not include court costs, is hereby established by the City of Fairhope, Alabama pursuant to the law of the State of Alabama (Section 11-45-9.1 Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended, and Rule 20(c) of the Alabama Rules of Judicial Administration). 
(b)  If a defendant elects to plead guilty before a magistrate to a first or second violation of any of the listed municipal laws, the fine which does not include court costs, established in said schedule of fines shall apply in uncontested municipal court cases. However, a defendant in lieu of appearing before the magistrate may sign a guilty plea and waiver of trial provisions on the municipal offense ticket and deliver the amount of fine and court costs to the clerk of the municipal court. Provided, however, that upon a first-time violation, defendant may contact the magistrate at 205/928-2136 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday and the magistrate may, upon verifying a first offense, provide court costs and direct the defendant to sign the guilty plea and waiver on the ticket and to mail same with bank check or money order for correct amount of fine and costs, pursuant to this article, to the Clerk of the Municipal Court; P.O. Drawer 429; Fairhope, AL 36533. 
(Ord. No. 862, § 2, 8-27-90) 
Sec. 10-28. - Authority of certain city employees to issue. 
(a)  When any officer, inspector, investigator, auditor, or other employee of the city designated by any city ordinance, code or appointment by the mayor, as an enforcement officer finds any violation or violations of any provision of any municipal laws which he is authorized and required to enforce, said city employee may issue, on forms provided by the city, a municipal offense ticket and deliver it to the person in violation of such municipal law. The municipal offense ticket shall direct said person to appear in the municipal court of the city at a time and a date stated therein to answer to the charge or charges for violating such municipal law, which shall be stated in such municipal offense ticket. Provided, however, that such defendant may, on the first or second offense, appear before the magistrate and pay fines and costs as provided in section 10-27, or on the first offense may pay fines and costs by mail as further provided in section 10-27. 
    Remittance by mail of fine and costs to the court clerk constitutes a guilty plea and waiver of trial, whether or not the guilty plea and waiver of trial provision on the ticket were signed by defendant. Should the amount tendered be insufficient, such money received by the clerk or magistrate shall be considered a partial payment of the lawful penalty, applied by the clerk to the fines and costs, and disbursed as required by law. The clerk may give notice of such insufficiency, and a supplemental summons or warrant of arrest shall be issued for the offender's arrest, and a judgment shall be entered by the court for the balance of the penalty due. 
(b)  If any person so cited shall fail to appear in the municipal court, at the time and place stated in any municipal offense ticket duly issued, or to pay the appropriate fine set forth on the municipal offense ticket, as set forth in this article, the municipal judge may issue an alias warrant charging such person with failure to appear in answer to citation for violation of the municipal law, or laws, listed on such municipal offense ticket. 
(c)  The officers, inspectors, investigators, auditors, or other employees of the city, designated by municipal law as enforcement officers and authorized to issue municipal offense tickets as herein provided, are hereby further authorized to swear out warrants or execute affidavits or complaints charging such person or persons with any violation of municipal law, without first having issued a municipal offense ticket for such violation.

a.  The person requesting the permit must have adequate tools, equipment and manpower to stay with and control the fire during the entire burning period. 
b.  The person requesting the permit is responsible to keep the fire confined. 
c.  In no case will the person requesting the permit allow the fire to be unattended until is dead out. 
    Burning permits will be issued if the individual requesting the permit states that the above criteria will be met unless the fire official shall declare a fire alert. Under fire alert conditions the fire official may allow issuance of permits at his discretion, taking into account the number of fires burning in the jurisdiction, current and projected weather conditions, the ability of the person seeking the permit to contain the fire and that individual's knowledge of fire behavior and other factors which may affect fires and fire behavior. A fire alert will be issued by the fire official for any portion of the jurisdiction that in the opinion of the fire official has existing conditions which produce extraordinary danger from fire. 
    If subsequent to issuance of a permit a lawfully authorized fire escapes to the lands of another an investigation reveals that the permit holder did not meet all the criteria as set forth above, the fire will be treated as if no legal authorization had been obtained. 
    A burning permit once issued may be revoked if the person requesting the permit fails to comply with proper burning procedures or if weather conditions develop which may result in erratic fire behavior.

DIVISION 2. - SPECIAL SEWER FACILITIES[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1048, §§ 1-9, adopted April 15, 1999, contained provisions that did not specifically amend this Code. At the editor's discretion, said provisions were included as Art. II, Div. 2, §§ 12-41-12-49. Formerly, Art. II contained §§ 12-1-12-35, and for purposes of classification, those sections have been redesignated as Art. II, Div. 1, Generally. 

Sec. 12-41. - Purpose. 
    The purpose and intent of this division is to provide a means whereby certain areas within and without the city may be provided an alternative means of disposal of sanitary waste other than the usual underground disposal method. Because much if not all of the area contemplated is not topographically suited to the usual gravity line means of sewage disposal, the city has engaged engineering expertise to provide special facilities within the service area which will diminish the reliance on septic tanks and drain fields and thus reduce the environmental problems inherent to use of such systems in high density situations. 
    Because of the interdependent nature of the facilities to be installed, it is critical that exact specifications be followed for equipment installed and methods of installation. To that end, it is necessary that the city promulgate the within controls over supply, installation, inspection and maintenance of required facilities. It is imperative that the city exercise strict control so that no one part of the system operates to the injury of another part; therefore, the city reserves the right to deny connection or discharge to its system from any facility where the installer, owner or person in control fails or refuses to fully conform to the city's requirements as herein provided or referenced. In the event that any facility is operated in such a manner as to be a danger to other parts of the system, the city after having provided reasonable opportunity for the owner to make necessary correction may disconnect the facility from the system and take such legal action as may be required to have the premises vacated pending correction of the problem.

(2)  For all land disturbing activities for the purposes of multifamily residential or commercial usage, the person responsible for the land disturbing activity shall submit, prior to final plat approval or issuance of a building permit, a simplified stormwater management plan. This plan will require approval of the city building inspector, but not professional certification. The requirements of this plan are presented below: 
A narrative description of the stormwater management facilities to be used; 
A general description of topographic and soil conditions of the development site; 
A general description of adjacent property and a description of existing structures, buildings, and other fixed improvements located on surrounding properties; 
A sketch plan to accompany the narrative which shall contain: 
A site location drawing of the proposed project, indicating the location of the proposed project in relation to roadways, jurisdictional boundaries, streams and rivers; 
The boundary lines of the site on which the work is to be performed; 
All areas within the site, which will be included in the land disturbing activities, shall be identified and the total disturbed area calculated; 
A topographic map of site; 
Anticipated starting and completion dates of the various stages of land disturbing activities and the expected date the final stabilization will be complete; 
The location of temporary or permanent vegetative and structural stormwater management control measures. 
Stormwater management plans shall contain certification by the persons responsible for the land disturbing activity that the land disturbing activity will be accomplished pursuant to the plan and that the any and all management control structures will be maintained in such as a manner as to prevent and minimize the threat or potential hazard to human life, property or the environment. 
Stormwater management plans shall contain certification by the person responsible for the land disturbing activity that the city building inspector has the right to conduct on-site inspections. 
(3)  For all land development activities greater than five (5) acres in area, a copy of the NPDES Permit as required by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) must be submitted to the city building inspector prior to final plat approval or issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  A list of fees for plan reviews and other fees associated with this article can be obtained from the city building inspector. 
(d)  Stormwater management facilities may include both structural and nonstructural elements. Natural swales and other natural runoff conduits shall be retained where practicable. 
Where additional stormwater management facilities are required to satisfy the minimum control requirements, the following measures are examples of what may be used: 
Stormwater detention structures (dry basins); 
Stormwater retention structures (wet ponds); 
Facilities designed to encourage overland flow, slow velocities of flow, and flow through buffer zones; and 
Infiltration practices. 
Where detention and retention structures are used, consolidation of these facilities into a limited number of large structures will be preferred over designs that utilize a large number of small structures. 
Stormwater management plans and plans for future maintenance can be rejected by the city building inspector if they incorporate structures and facilities that will demand considerable maintenance, will be difficult to maintain, or utilize numerous small structures if other alternatives are physically possible. 
The landowner and/or property manager shall be responsible for the maintenance of all stormwater management structures or controls. The landowner and the property manager, if different from the owner, will be jointly and severally liable for any damages caused to public or private property by their failure to properly maintain the control structures. 
Should the city deem that the failure to maintain the control structure(s) poses a significant present threat or potential hazard to human life, property or the environment, the city shall have the authority to enter upon the premises and take any remedial action necessary to maintain or repair the structure in such a manner as to remove the threat or hazard damage. The property owner or property manager shall be liable to the city for the city's recoverable expenses resulting from such action. 
The staffs of each city department involved in the remedial action to shall keep a detailed record of its recoverable expenses resulting from the action. Promptly after completion of the action, the staff shall certify those expenses with the city clerk. The city clerk shall mail an invoice to the person responsible for the emergency action. The invoice shall be payable within thirty (30) days and if payment is not received within thirty (30) days the city may initiate a civil action for the collection of the claim. This civil action shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any criminal prosecution or penalty. 
The recoverable expenses resulting from any remedial response or action required by the improper maintenance of any stormwater management control structure which poses a significant present threat or potential hazard to human life, property or the environment, shall be a charge against the person or entity whose conduct or conduct of its employees, agents or contractors, caused or permitted the incident resulting in the remedial response. Said recoverable expenses shall also be a lien against the subject property and said lien shall be recorded in the records of the judge of probate by the city building inspector. 
The drainage system and all stormwater management structures within the city will be designed in accordance with the technical criteria and standards established by the city building inspector.

Sec. 12-101. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the jurisdiction of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-102. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-103. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;

Secs. 12-157-12-177. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 12-178. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure; 
(2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
(3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. (Not applicable in coastal high hazard areas.) 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by an Alabama licensed professional engineer or registered architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms unless they meet the criteria set forth in section 12-182(6)a. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. The protection of these systems will be in substantial compliance with FEMA 348 "Protection of Utilities from Flood Damage". In the event that such procedures cause or may cause an unsafe condition during non-flooding events or cause conflict with life safety provisions of any related code, reasonable measures to prevent such instances will be allowed at the discretion of the building official. 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-179. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 12-178(4), Elevated Buildings. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. An Alabama registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 12-156(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
c.  All Manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer to section 12-178). Manufactured homes will not be allowed in coastal high hazard areas (V-zones). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on it's wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a.-c. above. Recreational vehicles will not be allowed in coastal high hazard areas (V-zones). 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-126, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. An Alabama registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Require until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted with zones A and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city. 
c.  Only if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-180. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-126, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 12-126, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by an Alabama registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 12-178(4), Elevated Buildings. 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-181. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-126, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet (3) above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 12-178(4), Elevated Buildings. 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus two (2) feet, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. An Alabama registered professional engineer or registered architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in sections 12-155(1)c. and 12-155(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-182. - Coastal high hazard areas (V-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-126, are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V-zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge, therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide; 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work, decorative screening, or breakaway walls may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (6) below; 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or shear walls; and 
(4)  All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the adopted edition of the Standard Building Code or International Building Code. 
(5)  An Alabama registered professional engineer shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in full compliance with the provisions contained in subsections (2), (3), (4) herein. 
(6)  All space below the lowest horizontal-supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work, decorative screening or breakaway walls may be permitted and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed: 
a.  Solid walls shall be constructed in substantial compliance with the provisions of FEMA Technical Bulletin 9-99 "Design and Construction Guidance for Breakaway Walls Below Elevated Coastal Buildings"; and 
b.  Other approved materials shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only. 
c.  Any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage used in connection with the premises. 
(7)  Prior to construction, plans for any of the above enclosure provisions must be submitted to the building official for approval; breakaway wall designs must be designed and signed by an Alabama licensed professional engineer. 
(8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with lattice-work, decorative screening, or breakaway walls as provided in this section. 
(9)  There shall be no fill material used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The building official shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
a.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
b.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
c.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(10)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands which would increase potential flood damage; 
(11)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring and elevation standards of section 12-182 are met. 
(12)  Critical or child care facilities, as defined within this article, shall be prohibited in the special flood hazard area. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-183. - Standards for subdivisions. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(b)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage so long as it does not conflict with safety or access provisions or requirements of related model codes as determined by the building official; 
(c)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
(d)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less. 
(Ord. No. 1368, 9-22-08) 
Sec. 12-184. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of adjustments and appeals as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustments and appeals may appeal such decision to the Baldwin County Circuit Court, as provided in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-80. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of adjustments and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal and state emergency management agencies upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of adjustments and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Exceptions may be made for "period" shots or shots that are more than one (1) day in duration. The city noise ordinance shall be enforced unless special variance is granted. 
(6)  Production companies blocking or holding traffic on streets scheduled for trash/recycling pickup must allow trucks to access those areas for normal pickup. 
(7)  Residents may not charge production companies for the use of public rights-of-way in front of their homes, nor prohibit their use without justifiable cause.

(Ord. No. 1567, § VI, 1-25-16) 
Sec. 14-57. - Central business districts. 
    Where residential areas exist within the boundaries of the central business district, the same rules that apply to residential filming must be followed. This determination will be made on a case-by-case basis.

ARTICLE IV. - POLICE DEPARTMENT DISCIPLINE 

Sec. 16-51. - Purpose and coverage. 
    Except as otherwise stated in City of Fairhope Personnel Rules, Polices and Procedures ("personnel rules") § 9.06, all city police department ("department") employees, including "law enforcement officers," are covered under the personnel rules. The purpose of this article is: 
(1)  To supplement the disciplinary guidelines and procedures applicable to all department employees; and 
(2)  To establish the pre-disciplinary review and hearing procedures for "law enforcement officers" as provided under Code of Ala. § 11-43-230. 
    "Law enforcement officers" include all police officers employed by the City of Fairhope, who have successfully completed the required probationary period and who have the authority to make arrests as defined under Code of Ala. § 11-43-181 and § 11-43-231. Law enforcement officers are covered by Alabama statutes addressing the tenure and discipline of law enforcement officers, and this article is intended to comply fully with these statutes. See Code of Ala. § 11-43-180 et seq. and § 11-43-230 et seq. 
    This article shall not cover the chief of police, who is appointed and subject to disciplinary suspension without pay of up to thirty (30) days, a demotion or dismissal by the city council (Code of Ala. §§ 11-43-187, § 11-43-3, § 11-43-5 and § 11-43-160(a)(1)). The mayor shall have the authority to issue a disciplinary verbal or written warning to the chief of police for good cause. 
    While this article provides disciplinary procedures and guidelines applicable to department employees who are not "law enforcement officers," this article does not otherwise modify the personnel rules applicable to such employees. 
(Ord. No. 1492, § 1, 4-22-13) 
Sec. 16-52. - General code of conduct. 
    To ensure the department properly performs its mission to enforce the law, to protect our citizens and to ensure our citizens have confidence in the department, all department employees must maintain a high standard of honesty, integrity and professional conduct, both on duty and off duty. Conduct unbecoming a department employee is a ground for discipline, including dismissal. All department employees must comply with the city personnel rules, and the department's PGOs, cannons of police ethics and rules of conduct. Violations of this general code of conduct, the personnel rules, department PGOs, or department cannons of police ethics and rules of conduct, generally are referred to in this article as "misconduct." 
(Ord. No. 1492, § 2, 4-22-13) 
Sec. 16-53. - Non-disciplinary counseling. 
    A department employee's supervisor or the chief of police may counsel the employee in an effort to correct unacceptable job performance or minor misconduct. A written counseling report is not required. However, if a written counseling report is prepared, the report shall include a brief description of the unacceptable job performance or misconduct, and the date of the report. The report must be signed by the employee and the supervisor or chief of police. The employee will be provided a copy of any such counseling report and a copy will be maintained in the employee's personnel file. 
(Ord. No. 1492, § 3, 4-22-13) 
Sec. 16-54. - Disciplinary actions. 
    All department employees are subject to the following disciplinary actions. 
(1)  Verbal warning. A verbal warning may be issued by the chief of police or by the employee's supervisor with the approval of the chief of police for unacceptable job performance or minor misconduct. 
(2)  Written warning. A written warning may be issued by the chief of police or by the employee's supervisor with the approval of the chief of police for unacceptable job performance or for more serious or repeated misconduct. Depending on the severity of the unacceptable job performance or misconduct, a written warning may be given without a prior verbal warning. 
(3)  Disciplinary procedures for written and verbal warnings. Before issuing a verbal or written warning, the employee's supervisor or the chief of police will meet with the employee, describe the unacceptable job performance or misconduct supporting the verbal or written warning, and afford the employee the opportunity to respond. If the supervisor or the chief of police makes the decision to issue the verbal or written warning after hearing the employee's response, the supervisor shall document the disciplinary action on an employee record notification form. 
The employee record notation form shall include: 
(i)  The discipline proposed or to be imposed (e.g., a written warning); 
(ii)  The reason(s) for the discipline (e.g., the rules of conduct or policy violated); 
(iii)  A brief statement of the facts supporting the reason(s); and 
(iv)  The date. 
The supervisor or the chief of police issuing the employee record notation form shall sign the form and review the form with the employee. The employee shall be required to sign the form to acknowledge that the form has been reviewed with the employee. The employee shall have the opportunity to write on the form any response to the discipline. A copy of the form will be provided to the employee and a copy shall be maintained in the employee's personnel file. 
The pre-disciplinary review and hearing procedures under this article shall not apply to a verbal or written warning. 
(4)  Disciplinary demotion or suspension without pay. The chief of police may recommend a disciplinary demotion (a reduction in rank for law enforcement and corrections officers) or a suspension without pay of up to thirty (30) days for continuing or serious unacceptable job performance or for repeated or serious misconduct. The proposed discipline must be documented on an employee record notation form, which shall state the proposed discipline (e.g., ten-day suspension without pay), the reason(s) for the discipline (e.g., "conduct unbecoming a department employee"), and a brief statement of the facts supporting such reason(s). The form shall be signed by the chief of police. The chief of police shall forward the form to the human resources director. The proposed disciplinary demotion or suspension without pay must be reviewed by the human resources director and approved by the mayor, who shall sign the form. The length of a proposed unpaid suspension will depend on the severity of the misconduct or unacceptable job performance and the employee's prior disciplinary record or performance record. If warranted, the employee may be demoted or suspended without pay as the first step in the process. Employees are not allowed to use paid vacation while on unpaid suspension. 
(5)  Dismissal. The chief of police may recommend dismissal from employment for continuing or serious unacceptable job performance or for repeated or serious misconduct. The proposed dismissal must be documented on an employee record notation form, which shall state the nature of the proposed discipline, the reason(s) therefor, and a brief statement of the facts supporting the reason(s). The form shall be signed by the chief of police. The chief of police shall forward the form to the human resources director. Any proposed dismissal must be reviewed by the human resources director and approved by the mayor, who shall sign the form. Employees who fail to improve unacceptable performance or misconduct after progressive discipline are subject to dismissal. If warranted, however, the employee may be dismissed without previous counseling or disciplinary action. 
(Ord. No. 1492, § 4, 4-22-13) 
Sec. 16-55. - Disciplinary procedures for department employees who are not "law enforcement officers." 
    For department employees who are not "law enforcement officers," a disciplinary demotion, a suspension without pay or dismissal is subject to the disciplinary procedures established under the city's personnel rules. 
(Ord. No. 1492, § 5, 4-22-13) 
Sec. 16-56. - Pre-disciplinary hearing for law enforcement officers. 
    For "law enforcement officers," a disciplinary demotion, a suspension without pay or dismissal is subject to the "pre-disciplinary hearing for law enforcement officers" under this article. 
(1)  The department review officer. The mayor and the chief of police shall recommend to the city council a department review officer to conduct pre-disciplinary hearings for "law enforcement officers" under this article. The city council shall appoint the review officer, who shall conduct pre-disciplinary hearings on the approved suspension, disciplinary demotion, or dismissal of law enforcement officers as provided under Code of Ala. § 11-43-231. The review officer must be impartial and shall have the authority to impose a proposed disciplinary demotion, suspension without pay or dismissal that has been approved by the mayor under this article. The review officer shall continue to serve in that capacity until his or her removal is recommended by the mayor and approved by the city council. The review officer shall have no term of office and may be removed at any time by the city council. 
A law enforcement officer subject to a pre-disciplinary hearing under this provision may request the review officer to recuse himself or herself on the ground the review officer is not "impartial" and therefore unable to render a fair decision. The request must be in writing and must state in detail the reason(s) the law enforcement officer believes the review officer is not impartial and cannot render a fair decision in the pre-disciplinary hearing. If the review officer concludes there is a reasonable basis for recusal, the review officer shall recuse himself or herself from conducting the pre-disciplinary hearing and the mayor shall appoint an impartial substitute review officer to conduct the pre-disciplinary hearing. The substitute shall have the same authority as the review officer. 
(2)  Law enforcement officers-The pre-disciplinary hearing. If the chief of police recommends and the mayor approves a disciplinary demotion, a suspension without pay, or dismissal, the following pre-disciplinary hearing procedures shall apply to "law enforcement officers." The human resources director shall provide the employee record notation form, to the review officer.

If the officer fails to deliver a written request for a hearing within ten (10) days from the date he or she receives the notice, the officer shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a pre-disciplinary hearing, and the chief of police shall proceed with the proposed disciplinary action. If the officer timely delivers written notice requesting a pre-disciplinary hearing, the hearing shall be scheduled by the review officer. 
The chief of police and any department supervisor who participated in the decision to recommend the proposed discipline shall attend the hearing. The officer has the right to appear at the hearing in person or by representative and to respond to the stated reason(s) for the proposed disciplinary action and the nature of the proposed discipline to be imposed. If the officer has a representative, the officer shall also be present at the hearing. 
At the pre-disciplinary hearing, the officer shall have the opportunity to present any response he or she may wish to offer to the reason(s) for the proposed discipline or to the nature of the proposed discipline to be imposed.

A representative of the city shall have the opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses offered by the officer and the officer or his or her representative shall have the opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses offered by the city. The rules of evidence and the rules of discovery applicable in court proceedings shall not apply to the pre-disciplinary hearing. 
Following the pre-disciplinary hearing, the review officer shall make the decision whether discipline should be imposed and, if so, the nature of the discipline to be imposed. The review officer may accept the discipline recommended by the chief of police and approved by the mayor, may impose lesser discipline, or may make the decision that discipline should not be imposed. The review officer shall issue a written decision, which shall state the disciplinary action to be imposed and a brief statement of the reason(s) for the decision. The decision shall not recite the evidence presented at the hearing or disclose the names of any witnesses who testified at the hearing. The review officer shall provide written notice of the decision to the officer, the chief of police, and the human resources director, within five (5) working days after the pre-disciplinary hearing unless the time is extended by the review officer for good cause.

The human resources director shall provide a copy of the notice to the review officer. 
    If the employee requests a postponement of the pre-disciplinary hearing, the review officer may grant a postponement of up to fourteen (14) days. If the employee requests a postponement of the hearing, such request shall be conditioned upon the employee's agreement that the employee shall be placed on administrative leave without pay from the date the hearing was initially scheduled through the decision of the review officer. The employee's request for a postponement shall be a waiver of any right or claim the employee may have with regard to the administrative leave without pay. 
(Ord. No. 1492, § 7, 4-22-13) 
Sec. 16-58. - EEO/harassment policy. 
    A request for pre-disciplinary hearing under this article is not a substitute for a complaint under the city's "EEO/Harassment Policy" in the personnel rules. If a department employee, including a law enforcement officer, believes that any proposed disciplinary action would violate the city's "EEO/Harassment Policy," in addition to the procedures available under this article or the personnel rules, the employee must utilize the "complaint procedure" under the EEO/Harassment Policy.

Sec. 17-8. - Impact fees on development. 
(1)  Findings . In accordance with the Act, the city has been authorized by the legislature of the state to adopt and impose impact fees on new development within the city's corporate limits. In support the adoption and imposition of such impact fees, the council makes the following findings: 
(a)  The city is a municipal corporation vested with a portion of the state's sovereign power to protect and provide for the public health, safety, and welfare. The city is authorized to adopt and implement comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances and other land use regulations to assure its orderly development. 
(b)  The city is a fast-growing community of over fifteen thousand (15,000) full time residents. In calendar year 2005, approximately four hundred ninety (490) new building permits were issued, and in calendar year 2006, approximately five hundred four (504) new building permits were issued. 
(c)  The city encourages development that will make the city a vital, attractive community to serve both residents of the city and the substantial and significant number of visitors who visit the city on a yearly basis. 
(d)  New residential and nonresidential development, however, imposes increased and excessive demands upon public facilities. As demand for public facilities has increased, funding sources for those facilities have decreased at both the state and federal level. In addition, demand for new facilities necessitated by new development impairs the ability of the city to maintain existing facilities because funds must be diverted to construction or expansion of new facilities. 
(e)  The city's current comprehensive plan projects that new development will continue and will place ever-increasing demands on the city to provide public facilities to serve new development. 
(f)  Following the adoption of the Act by the legislature of the state, the city engaged the consulting firm TischlerBise for purposes of preparing an impact fee study. With input from the city, TischlerBise prepared an "impact fee study" for the city dated March 8, 2007 (the "study"). 
(g)  The study demonstrates the monetary needs of the city in adding the additional governmental infrastructure necessary to keep pace with the city's growth. 
(h)  In accordance with Section 7 of the Act, a public hearing was held on April 10, 2007 at city hall to address the city's governmental infrastructure needs as a result of new development. At this public hearing, a representative of TischlerBise presented the study to the council and the public, and the public was given the opportunity to provide comments. 
(i)  To the extent that new development places demands upon public facilities, those demands should be satisfied by shifting the responsibility for financing the provision of such facilities from the public to the development creating the demands. 
(j)  An impact fee, established in accordance with this section, will benefit new development. 
(2)  Authorization . This section is enacted pursuant to the Act and the city's general police power and land use authority. 
(3)  Purpose and intent . The purpose of this section is to establish procedures to: 
(a)  Determine what local capital improvements are reasonably necessary to serve new development and the cost thereof; 
(b)  Determine the portion of the demand for local capital improvements created by particular types of new development; and 
(c)  Assess against new development an impact fee to finance the cost of local capital improvements proportional to the new development's demand for said capital improvements.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no party entitled to a refund of any impact fee hereunder shall be entitled to any interest on said refunded impact fee. 
(14)  Appeals .

(16)  Credits . An applicant who offers to dedicate land or otherwise provide or provide for the funding of governmental infrastructure may be eligible for a credit for such contribution against the impact fee otherwise due for that benefit area. In the event an applicant desires to obtain a credit in accordance with the foregoing, the applicant shall submit its proposal for a credit in writing to the building department.

(Code 1962, § 18-1; Ord. No. 596, § 1, 8-22-77) 
Sec. 19-2. - Requirements. 
(a)  Paving, curbing, guttering, storm drainage, water lines and sanitary sewer lines. All streets within the city or any assessment projects thereof that are to be improved by any person, including, but not limited to, contractors and subcontractors, subdividers, land developers, governing bodies, or others by providing street paving shall be provided with paving, curbing and guttering, which paving shall be not less than twenty (20) feet in width, and which curbing and guttering shall be of concrete construction. All such improvements shall meet with the minimum requirements as set forth in specifications of the regulations established. When any street within the city is improved by providing pavement and curbing and guttering, such streets shall also be provided with adequate drainage facilities to provide for the drainage of surface waters. All sanitary sewer, water, storm drainage and street plans shall be prepared by a licensed and registered engineer as required by law. The engineer shall furnish and deliver to the building official of the city a set of proposed street improvement plans for approval before any work is started on the streets. The engineer shall also perform the supervision of construction, and before the streets are accepted by the city for maintenance, the engineer shall furnish the city a corrected set of "as built" plans showing any changes made during construction of the streets, with the following certification thereon executed by the engineer: 
    "I hereby certify that I have designed the within improvements in conformity with applicable codes and laws and with the principals of good engineering practice. I further certify that I have supervised the construction of the within improvements, that the same conforms to my design, that the within is a true and accurate representation of improvements as installed and that said improvements are hereby recommended for acceptance by the City of Fairhope, Alabama." 
The engineer shall also, as a part of the required construction, see that the contractor shall inscribe into the concrete curb a durable and distinctive mark for each and every water service lateral and for each and every sewer service lateral, such that the location of each service lateral may readily be ascertained. The engineer shall ascertain that all subgrade, subbase and/or base materials have been compacted as specified before permitting placement of curbing or paving. 
(1)  Pipe. All pipe shall meet A.S.T.A. standards for the grade and class of pipe used. Where the grade of a pipe is less than five-tenths (0.5) per cent sand traps two (2) feet deep shall be constructed in manholes, junction boxes or inlets at both the upper and lower end of the pipe. 
(2)  Paving. Paving shall meet the following specifications: 
Alternate No. 1. 11/2? asphalt wearing course 6? compacted sand clay base Alternate No. 2. 11/2" asphalt wearing course 8" compacted sand clay base Alternate No. 3. Thickness and composition of asphalt wearing surface and base courses may vary due to unusual soil or design requirements. Recommendations shall be made by the city engineer for approval by the city.  
(3)  Concrete. Concrete shall be a one: two: three and one half (1: 2: 3 1/2) mix and shall have three thousand (3,000) pounds per square inch compressive strength in twenty-eight (28) days. Cylinders shall be made and broken at seven (7) and twenty-eight (28) days. The contractor may be required to remove and replace, at no expense to the city, any concrete not meeting the specifications. Valley type gutter and combination curb and gutter shall have one-half (1/2) inch expansion joints thirty (30) feet on centers and contraction joints ten (10) feet on centers. 
(4)  Base. In no case shall sand clay base be used until the site of the work has been inspected by the authorized agent of the city to see if thorough drainage of the subgrade can be obtained. Where the subgrade is questionable, the authorized agent shall cause soil bearing tests to be performed before placement of sand clay base. Sand clay base shall meet the requirements of the current state highway department's specifications. The contractor shall furnish the authorized agent of the city compaction tests during placement of base and borings of base after placement showing the thickness of base. Compaction tests and borings shall be made at intervals not greater than two hundred (200) feet, but in no case shall fewer than four (4) tests borings be made on any street of less than eight hundred (800) feet in length. Tests and borings shall be numbered consecutively with all odd numbered tests located on street centerline and alternate even numbered tests being located on left and right sides of street within eighteen (18) inches of curb line. Compaction of subgrade and base shall meet the requirements of current state highway department specifications and the contractor shall remove and replace, at no expense to the city, any base not meeting the specifications. 
If base is found to be less than the required thickness, the street will not be accepted until the required thickness is obtained. 
(5)  Asphalt wearing course. Asphalt surfacing shall be one and one-half (1 1/2) inches thick after compaction. The contractor or developer shall furnish the authorized agent of the city borings made at the same intervals as required for base in subparagraph (4) above, showing the thickness of asphalt surfacing. If the asphalt is found to be less than the required depth, the streets shall not be accepted by the city until the necessary corrections are made. The contractor or developer may be required to remove and replace, at no cost to the city, any asphalt not meeting the specifications. 
(b)  Street markings and signs. All street name signs, traffic control signs and required traffic markings shall be installed by the contractor or developer before acceptance of the street will be made by the city. Street name signs shall conform to the city's standards. All traffic control signs and markings shall conform to state highway department standards. 
(c)  Concrete monuments. Concrete monuments shall be set according to the city planning commission regulations. 
(d)  Testing laboratory. An approved testing laboratory shall be employed to make tests. This will in no way keep the authorized agent of the city from making any additional tests such agent may deem necessary. 
(e)  General. Copies of all test reports made by the testing laboratories shall be furnished by the city. Streets will not be accepted by the city for maintenance until all requirements have been met. 
(f)  Maintenance bond. The person or firm, including but not limited to contractors and subcontractors, subdividers, developers, governing bodies, or others, shall furnish to the city a maintenance bond guaranteeing the repair of all damage due to improper materials or workmanship for a period of two (2) years from date of acceptance of the work by the city. The form of bond and the surety providing bond shall meet the approval of the city. The amount of the bond shall be not less than thirty (30) percent of the total cost of the work being accepted by the city.

Sec. 19-10. - Responsibility of builders doing construction work on lands abutting public rights-of-way; penalties for violations. 
(a)  It is the intent of the city that all public lands shall remain under the direct control of the city and that any use thereof except as otherwise provided herein shall be subject to the authorization of the mayor. The mayor may delegate power of authorization to the department heads, subject to his overall supervision; provided that such authorization shall be in writing. 
(b)  Where a building permit has been issued for construction upon lands abutting the public right-of-way, such permit carries with it the implicit authority for the builder to have ingress and egress across the public right-of-way for access to the construction site by vehicles and personnel required for the prosecution of the work. Provided, however, except in cases of unusual hardship where permission has been granted by the city in writing, the public rights-of-way or other public lands shall not be used by the builder as a construction staging area nor as a parking lot for construction or workers' vehicles; neither shall the public property be used for the storage of building materials, temporarily or otherwise. The builder shall safeguard the public property, keep the same clear of obstructions and debris and shall keep the same free from any condition arising out of his operation which would or might present a hazard to persons using or entitled to use such public property. The builder shall at all times preserve the state of maintenance of the public property to that which existed at the start of his operation. 
(c)  Where the public property is being used in connection with a valid building permit in a manner such as to constitute a violation of this or any other city code or ordinance, the building official or any other authorized enforcement officer is empowered to take the following actions: 
(1)  On a first offense, the official shall issue to the offending party by certified mail, by personal service, or by posting on the work site a municipal warning, setting forth the nature of violation and the required remedy, allowing not less than forty-eight (48) hours for compliance, except in a situation where conditions are such as to pose an imminent danger to life or property. In the event that the offending party fails or refuses to correct the violation within the time prescribed, the official may then issue a municipal offense ticket under the provisions of section 10-26 et seq. of the Fairhope Code of Ordinances. Such tickets may be issued for a first or subsequent offense hereunder. The minimum fine a first offense shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00), for a second offense, two hundred dollars ($200.00), and for any subsequent offense at the discretion of the judge trying the case. A jail sentence may be meted out at the discretion of the judge for any offense hereunder in addition to the prescribed fine. The issuance of a municipal ticket shall not bar the official from pursuing any other remedial action authorized by this or any other law or code of the city. 
(2)  Within not less than forty-eight (48) hours after having issued a written warning to the offending party, and where there is not an imminent peril to life or property, the building official or other authorized enforcement officer may issue a stop work order directing that all construction activity under the permit cease until the violation has been corrected. Such stop work order may be directed to the offending party by certified mail, by personal service or by posting upon the work site. Any person who continues work in willful disregard of such stop order may be charged with violation of section 1-9 of the Fairhope Code of Ordinances. Prior notice of violation shall not be required where the enforcement officer reasonably believes that there is imminent peril to life or property. The foregoing shall not operate as a bar to the official's filing a formal complaint for issuance of a warrant of arrest for violation of the provisions herein. 
(3)  Where a condition exists as a result of the operations of a licensee of the public property such as would or might present an imminent peril to life or property, the city may perform the work reasonably required to mitigate the hazard and, in such event, shall bill the licensee for the costs of the work so performed. Nonpayment of such claim may result in a lien against the property of the licensee which is the beneficiary of the permitted use of public property. 
(d)  The authorization to use public property does not imply the right to cut or otherwise disturb pavement on any city street or walkway nor to disturb any utility. Such work shall require the express consent of the city in writing and, when issued, it shall be a condition subsequent that all alterations and repairs be made to the city's requirements and be approved by the general superintendent. Violations of this section shall be subject to the same enforcement procedures as outlined in subsection (c) above, insofar as applicable. Persons exempt from the permit requirement as provided in section 19-5(2) and (3) of the Code of Ordinances shall nonetheless be subject to the same sanctions for failing to safeguard, repair or restore the public property in the course of their operations. 
(Ord. No. 945, §§ 1-4, 9-13-93) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 945, §§ 1-4, adopted Sept. 13, 1993, amended the Code but not specify manner of codification; hence inclusion as § 19-10 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Sec. 19-11. - Restrictions on utility aerial mains and/or service supply lines. 
(a)  For purposes of this section, the terms public street, public alley, public way or public easement are synonymous and shall mean and include all routes of access for vehicles, pedestrians or utilities within the corporate limits of the city, regardless of whether such routes are publicly or privately maintained. 
(b)  From and after the effective date of this section [December 12, 1994], no aerial electrical, telephone, cable television or other service or supply line shall be installed at or connected to any existing underground service main on any public way in the city. 
(c)  From and after the effective date of this section, no aerial mains shall be installed by any utility supplier in those public ways where there exists underground electrical, telephone or cable television service, nor shall any aerial services or supply lines of any kind be installed in such areas. 
(d)  From and after the effective date of this section, no aerial mains or service supply lines for electrical service, telephone or cable television shall be installed by any supplier in any subdivision development approved within or annexed to the city after the effective date of this section. 
(e)  No person, firm, association or corporation shall substitute or convert any underground main or service supplying electricity, telephone or cable television with or to aerial lines. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to grant permission to any utility supplier to user the public ways of the City of Fairhope, Alabama in any manner except in conformity with the provisions of Section 220, Constitution of Alabama, 1901. 
(g)  Violation of section 19-11 above shall be punishable as provided in section 1-8 of the Fairhope Code of Ordinances and any use established in violation of section 19-11 may be enjoined as a public nuisance and removed. 
(Ord. No. 963, §§ 1-7, 12-12-94) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 963, adopted Dec. 12, 1994, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion as § 19-11 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Sec. 19-12. - Requirements for excavation and installation of utility services; time, place and manner. 
    Only work of the type authorized on the permit shall be performed and then only after site inspection by the officer issuing the permit or his deputy. 
    The inspecting officer may prohibit or limit open cuts and is hereby authorized to stop work when the activity underway is in any manner in violation of this or any other code or ordinance. 
    No open cut parallel to any curb or pavement edge shall be nearer to such curb or edge horizontally than the vertical depth of such cut measured from the existing surface grade. 
    No open cut shall be made where installation can be made by directional bore or bore on grade. 
    Where open cuts are authorized, no backfill shall be placed therein except in the presence of the city's inspector. Such backfill shall be placed in layers and thoroughly compacted. Where the inspector deems excavated material to be unsatisfactory for use as backfill, such excavated material shall be hauled away from the site and select material for backfill shall [be] supplied and placed by the installer. 
    The city's inspector may reasonably limit the hours and duration of the work in order to secure the public interest and safety. 
    The city's inspector is authorized to control the work undertaken by the installer in order to protect the public interest in the city property and his decision is final except upon appeal to the city council. Filing an appeal to the council shall be grounds for stopping all work in furtherance of the action being appealed. 
    None of the installer's equipment shall be parked or stored upon any private property without the owner's written consent nor on the public property so as to create a hazard or in violation of section 19-6.

(Ord. No. 1444, 2-28-11) 
Sec. 20.5-4. - General landscape requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. All rules, regulations, and requirements set forth in this section are applicable to the following: 
(1)  Any new development or construction, except single family residences and development or construction in the Central Business District (without off-street parking) that falls within the police jurisdiction of the City of Fairhope. This includes all public use buildings (i.e. churches, clubs, etc.) as well as city and private property. 
(2)  Any alteration to an existing building or development, excluding single family residences, or construction which changes the amount of gross floor area of a structure or building on a lot by more than thirty (30) percent. The property which undergoes such an alteration shall be required to come into complete compliance with this chapter at that time. This includes all public use and buildings as well as city and private property. 
(3)  Maintenance of plantings established previously under then-existing Fairhope ordinances shall be continued as required in subsections (l)(5) and (6) of this section. 
(b)  Protection of existing trees. During development of a site, every effort must be made to protect and retain heritage trees (see section 20.5-6, tree protection requirements). Retained trees will be credited toward fulfillment of this chapter (see below). If the city horticulturist determines that alternatives to tree removal exist, the landscape plan will be rejected. 
(c)  Landscape percentage requirements. 
(1)  On any building site for which an application for a building permit is made, at least twenty (20) percent of the total property (not including right-of-way) shall be landscaped. 
(2)  At least sixty (60) percent of this landscaping percentage requirement shall be located between the building walls and public rights-of-way. 
(d)  Required landscaping adjacent to public right-of-way. 
(1)  Front perimeter-except at permitted access ways, all interior development and vehicular use areas shall be separated from public right-of-way frontage by a landscaped strip of land at least ten (10) feet in width, adjacent and parallel to the right-of-way line. 
(2)  Secondary perimeter-except at permitted access ways, all interior development and vehicular use area located at intersections of the public right-of-way shall be separated by a landscaped strip at least six (6) feet in width and parallel to the right-of-way line. 
(3)  Land occupied by curbs and sidewalks shall not count toward required landscape areas. Vehicles shall not overhang more than two (2) feet onto landscaped areas. 
(4)  The required landscape area between vehicle use area and public right-of-way shall be planted with a solid unbroken visual screen at least forty-eight (48) inches in height at planting, except for four (4) feet each side of permitted access ways. Where non-living material is used for screen, one (1) shrub or vine at least thirty (30) inches in height at planting shall be required on the right-of-way side, for each ten (10) linear feet, or fraction thereof, of screen. 
(e)  Perimeter landscaping. The front setback must contain at least one (1) required overstory tree for every thirty (30) feet of road frontage, or any portion thereof. These frontage trees must be planted within the first twenty-five (25) feet of the property line. In addition, the site must contain one (1) required overstory tree for every thirty (30) feet of remaining outside lot perimeter, or any portion thereof and one (1) required overstory or understory tree for every twelve (12) parking spaces, or portion thereof. At least half of the required trees must be overstory trees. Trees may be chosen from section 20.5-13 (overstory) or section 20.5-14 (understory). Other tree species may be used if approved by the city horticulturist. 
(f)  Interior landscaping requirements. Where accommodations are provided for parking of fifty (50) or more vehicles, interior landscape areas shall be provided, so located as to break the expanse of pavement and to guide traffic flow. The total area provided for interior landscaping shall be at least ten (10) percent of the total paved area for parking and access. Trees, shrubs, grass and other ground cover shall be planted in the same ratio as required in perimeter landscaping. 
(1)  In addition to the foregoing, for parking lots designed to accommodate large volumes of parking such as shopping centers, the following requirements shall apply: 
(2)  A continuous landscape strip of at least seven (7) feet in width at every fourth parking row, with solid protective curbing. Vehicles shall not overhang more than two (2) feet into landscaped areas. 
(3)  No more than twelve (12) continuous parking spaces shall occur without an intervening planting strip at least seven (7) feet wide located adjacent and parallel to the parking spaces. 
(4)  At least one (1) tree (of species listed in section 20.5-13 or 20.5-14) is required for every twelve (12) parking spaces within the parking lot. 
(5)  Where fifty (50) or more vehicles are to be accommodated, solid, raised curbs shall be installed for protection of landscaped areas and to control traffic flow within the parking lot. Openings may be provided as required for pedestrian walks and passages. Alternative designs to aid storm water management (such as rain gardens) may be approved by the city horticulturist and the planning and building director. 
(6)  To allow flexibility in tree preservation and landscape development and encourage innovative design, the city horticulturist may approve alternative proposals. Such proposals must provide for landscaping at least ten (10) percent of the total paved area for parking and access. 
(g)  To promote species richness. To promote species richness, a minimum of four (4) different tree species is required on each site; at least one (1) species must be an overstory tree. 
(h)  No bare ground shall be left exposed. Plant materials, grass, or other approved ground cover or mulch shall cover all non-paved and non-built developed areas. At least fifty (50) percent of such cover must be living vegetation. 
(i)  Cross-visibility. At the corner of each side of permitted points of access from public right-of-way, or at corners of intersecting streets, landscaping shall be so planted and maintained as to provide unobstructed visibility between the heights of two and one-half (21/2) feet and ten (10) feet within an area defined by constructing lines parallel to and twenty-five (25) feet from the point of intersection of curb lines projected. 
(j)  Vehicular use areas. Vehicular use areas and areas not occupied by development, located adjacent to side or rear property lines, shall be separated from adjacent property by a strip of land at least five (5) feet in width, adjacent and parallel to the lot line. This strip shall be landscaped and graded to receive rainfall run-off. Surface water run-off shall not be permitted to pass onto adjacent property. 
(k)  Buffer zone landscaping. 
(1)  Incompatible land use buffers. On any commercial, industrial, planned unit development (PUD) (as approved by the city council) or multi-family development (except duplexes) adjacent to or abutting a residential zoning district, a buffer strip along the incompatible property line(s) of the developing property is required. The buffer shall run the entire length of the abutting lot line(s) and be at least ten (10) feet wide. Under no circumstances shall this buffer impair vehicular flow. The type of buffer may consist of any or all of the following: 
a.  An opaque fence not less than eight (8) feet in height, with horizontal or vertical openings not greater than three (3) inches per one (1) linear foot and a four-foot wide strip of evergreen plantings (section 20.5-15) which will grow to at least six (6) feet in height within three (3) full growing seasons on the inside of the fence, or; 
b.  A staggered double row of Evergreen plantings at least six (6) feet in width, and at least six (6) feet in height at the time of planting. Plants shall be spaced in a manner to provide a nearly impervious visual barrier. At no time should the plants be pruned to a height below six (6) feet. 
c.  Natural undisturbed forest, which provides a nearly impervious visual barrier due to the dense nature of the plants and/or trees. If this option is chosen, the width of the buffer zone must be increased to twenty (20) feet in width. The only permitted removals within this buffer will be exotic invasive plants such as those listed in the appendix. 
(2)  Parking lot buffer zones. Paving shall not be placed closer than ten (10) feet to any property line. The property line shall be buffered with a landscaped strip of at least ten (10) feet in width. Many properties in the CBD are exempt from this requirement, due to zero lot line development provisions in the zoning ordinance. Whenever an applicant for a building permit in the CBD chooses not to build a parking lot up to a property line a buffer shall be installed. The city horticulturist and the planning and building director shall review and approve all parking lot buffer areas in the CBD. 
(3)  Screening of storm water detention/retention areas. Storm water detention/retention areas are hereby declared to be incompatible uses and shall be screened from direct view from all abutting properties by installation and maintenance of living plants not less than those required in subsection (1)a. and b., thirty-six (36) inches in height at the time of planting, to achieve a height of not less than six (6) feet in three (3) years after planting. Outer slopes of detention shall not be steeper than four (4) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical. Where water depth and time of detention is sufficient to require safety fencing, such fencing shall be installed behind required screening, on the pond side. The city horticulturist and the planning and building director may waive all or part of this requirement for detention areas that are shallow (less than two (2) feet deep) and maintained in permanent living grass cover. The City of Fairhope promotes the use of bio-retention ponds for water detention/retention areas. Requirements for fencing and screening are waived for qualified bio-retention areas approved by the city horticulturist and the planning and building director. 
(l)  Planting requirements. Any trees planted to meet [the requirements of] this chapter must meet the American Standards for Nursery Stock and the following requirements: 
(1)  Overstory trees must have an initial caliper diameter of at least two (2.0) inches and must be at least ten (10) feet in height. 
(2)  Understory trees must have an initial caliper diameter of at least one and half (1.5) inches and be at least eight (8) feet in height. 
(3)  Multi-stemmed understory trees must be a minimum of eight (8) feet in height and must have at least three (3) stems; each with a minimum caliper diameter of three-fourths (3/4) inches. A multi-stemmed tree only counts as one (1) tree credit. 
(4)  Trees must be obtained from a reputable source. Trees that have been dug in the wild will not be accepted. 
(5)  Maintenance of new plantings is the responsibility of the property owner. There will be two (2) required conformance reviews to confirm the establishment of the landscape. The first will be in six (6) months and the second in twelve (12) months. Any failures of the landscape must be replaced by a specified date determined by the city horticulturist. 
(6)  Any vegetation planted or retained to fulfill [the requirements of] this chapter, which dies, becomes damaged or diseased, must be replaced by the property owner. The property owner must notify the city horticulturist when the replacement has been scheduled and planted. Failure to replace trees that die will result in penalties (see section 20.5-9). 
(m)  Tree credits. A major goal of this chapter is to protect existing trees. Therefore, incentives are offered to retain existing natural vegetation as follows: 
Credit can be taken for a tree if the tree is in good, vigorous, healthy condition. Tree credits may be used towards landscape requirements. However, the front setback must contain one (1) overstory tree for every thirty (30) feet of road frontage, regardless of credited trees. A tree must be at least eight (8) inches DBH (Diameter at Breast Height - four and one-half (4.5) feet above the grade) to be credited. To determine the number of tree credits allowed, divide the DBH of the preserved tree by eight (8) and round downward, not to exceed seven (7) credited trees for any one (1) preserved. Trees listed in section 20.5-14 will not receive credit towards fulfilling [the requirements of] this chapter. 
(n)  Lands Adjacent to the following roads: U.S. Highway 98, Alabama Highway 104, North Section Street (Excluding any properties within the Central Business District), South Section Street (excluding properties within the Central Business District), South Mobile Street, Parker Road, Volanta Avenue, Gayfer Road, Gayfer Road Extension, Fairhope Avenue, Morphy Avenue, Nichols Avenue, Middle Street, Twin Beech Road and County Road 32.

Provided, however, that the greenspace shall be landscaped as follows: 
(1)  Where no vegetation, other than grass exists, new landscaping and plantings shall be installed within the twenty-foot strip as approved by the city horticulturist; otherwise the following shall apply: 
(2)  For front facing structures, the reserved area may be: 
a.  Left in its natural state; 
b.  Natural growth retained, but enhanced with addition of trees and shrubs. 
(Ord. No. 1444, 2-28-11) 
Sec. 20.5-5. - Special provisions for city properties and utility rights-of-way. 
(a)  City right-of-way.

(g)  Permitted removals . The city horticulturist may grant permission for the removal of trees on city-owned property when removal is in the public interest or when the city horticulturist deems it possible to make reasonable mitigation that will maintain the city's landscapes. Restitution may include planting trees on city property at any location the horticulturist designates or providing replacement funding to be used solely for tree planting within the city. Expenditure of such funds will be under the direction of the city council and administered by the city treasurer (see section 20.5-7). 
(h)  State of emergency. In the event of a state of emergency being declared, permits will not be required for emergency pruning or removal of hazardous trees as long as the work is supervised by a certified arborist and the process is well documented with digital photographs. 
(Ord. No. 1444, 2-28-11) 
Sec. 20.5-6. - Tree protection requirements. 
    The following requirements apply to all properties inside the central business district regardless of use. Outside the central business district, these requirements apply to all properties, regardless of use, except properties zoned R-A, R-1, R-1a, R-1b, R-1c, R-2, R-3 and R-3 PGH. Please see section 20.5-18, Managing trees during construction. 
(1)  A "heritage tree" is defined as any living tree (overstory or understory) with a stem diameter that exceeds twenty (20.0) inches. Such diameter will be measured at four and one-half (41/2) feet above ground level in the case of single-stem trees or as the sum of stem diameters at four and one-half (41/2) feet above the ground level in the case of multi-stemmed trees. Heritage trees are protected under this chapter and cannot be cut, pruned or otherwise intentionally harmed without express written permission of the city horticulturist. 
(2)  Any person wishing to remove or relocate a heritage tree shall, under the provisions of this section, make written application with the city horticulturist. The application shall include a landscape plan (as defined above). The city horticulturist must approve or deny the permit within fourteen (14) working days after receipt of the application. 
(3)  All tree removal will be at the property owner's expense except for (1) trees on the city right-of-way which are diseased, injured, in danger of falling close to existing structures, or which create unsafe vision clearance, the removal of which shall be funded by the city; or (2) trees beneath utility lines which threaten to damage the utility line, the removal of which is the duty of the utility company. 
(4)  Criteria for issuance of a tree removal permit: 
a.  The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed according to an approved plan. 
b.  The tree is diseased or injured, in danger of falling to close to an existing or proposed structure(s), interferes with existing utility service, creates unsafe vision clearance or conflicts with other ordinances or regulations. 
c.  The tree is, or will be after construction, in violation of federal, state, or local laws, including but not limited to laws and regulations pertaining to government programs for financing the construction. 
d.  A permit may be denied if the tree is considered vital to the natural heritage of the City of Fairhope and/or the city horticulturist determines that reasonable alternatives to cutting the tree exist. 
(5)  Development on parcels shall comply with the following requirements to protect heritage trees and other trees that are to be retained for landscape credit on the applicant's parcel: 
a.  Protective barricades shall be placed around all retained trees, to create a protective radius, and shall remain in place until land alteration, site clearing, and construction activities are complete. Barricades for the protective radius shall be erected with a minimum distance of twenty (20) feet from the trunks of heritage trees and ten (10) feet of other retained trees. Barricade shall consist of chain link fencing with signage. No entry, storage, temporary parking, or disturbance will be allowed within the barricade. 
b.  A minimum distance of twenty (20) feet from all heritage trees and ten (10) feet from all other retained trees shall be maintained when installing underground utilities. If this results in unreasonable hardship, a soil auger shall be used to tunnel under the tree roots. 
c.  Installation of protective barriers, fences, posts or walls shall not destroy or irreversibly harm the root systems of protected trees. Footers for walls shall end at the point where large roots are encountered, and the roots shall be bridged. Post holes and trenches located close to retained trees shall be adjusted to avoid damage to major roots. 
d.  All roots to be removed during site clearing and/or construction shall be severed cleanly at the perimeter of the protected radius. 
e.  A protective dry well and drainage/aeration system shall be provided where a retained tree would be adversely affected by raising the grade at or beyond the perimeter of the protected radius. 
f.  A protective retaining wall shall be constructed at or beyond the perimeter of the protective radius where a retained tree would be adversely affected by lowering the grade. 
g.  Paving base placement within the outside five (5) feet of the protective radius may be approved by the city horticulturist and the planning and building director, provided that effective pervious material/design is used. Such pervious material must be placed on grade, to reduce root system damage. 
h.  Structural foundations may be located at a distance of five (5) feet from the trunk of a retained tree, provided an effective pervious area radius is extended proportionally in three (3) other directions to allow a minimum of four hundred (400) square feet of pervious area. Additionally, the guidelines in section 20.5-18 shall be a part of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1444, 2-28-11) 
Sec. 20.5-7. - Nuisance trees. 
    The city horticulturist may require landowners, inclusive of single family residences, to prune and remove trees, which may endanger public safety or be likely to endanger other trees through the spread of disease or insect infestation. 
(Ord. No. 1444, 2-28-11) 
Sec. 20.5-8. - Exotic invasive trees. 
    Those trees listed in section 20.5-16 will always be permitted for removal. When removed within any described buffer zones, permitted removal must be performed without disturbing surrounding vegetation and with proper permit.

Such adjustment, when approved by the city council, shall be calculated as follows: 
LCA = 1 + ((TLCB - TLCBR)/BRRR) 
Where: 
TLCB = The total annual labor cost, in dollars, that is reflected in the electric utility budget for the coming fiscal year, as approved by the board. 
TLCBR = The total annual labor cost, in dollars, that is reflected in the current base electric rates. 
BRRR = The total revenue requirement, in dollars, that is reflected in current base electric rates. 
The LCA factor so calculated shall be applied to each retail rate set forth above, excluding schedule FCA, such that it will result in new base electric rates. Thus, when applied, a new TLCBR and BRRR will be established for future LCA calculations. The following accounts shall be used in the determination of total labor costs as reflected in TLCB and TLCBR: 
Collection costs/revenue department 
Administrative costs 
Salaries 
Payroll taxes 
Retirement expense 
Employee retirement/medical insurance

All CCF (one hundred cubic feet): $1.40 per CCF. 
(10)  General rules and regulations: 
a.  The above rates are those charged by the city and any additional charges levied by state or federal authorities, such as the four (4) per cent state utilities tax, shall be in addition to said rates. 
b.  Bills are payable within ten (10) days from due date and, if not paid within such period, may be increased by an amount to be determined by council. 
c.  When applicable, a service charge will be applied by the city gas department for calls made when interruption of service is not the fault of the city. 
d.  Retail service to more than one premises (unless served through one meter) shall not be combined, nor shall it be shared with or resold to others. 
e.  In the event the supply of natural gas to the city is curtailed or if the total supply is inadequate, only high-priority customers shall continue to receive service in accordance with the city's curtailment plan. A high-priority customer includes users of gas in a residence, small commercial establishment, school, hospital or similar institution, or any use where curtailment would endanger life, health, welfare or maintenance of physical property due to the unavailability of an alternate energy supply. 
f.  Normal service and delivery pressure to the customer shall be determined by the pressure available in the city's mains at the customer's location and may be reduced as necessary by the city to comply with supplier and regulatory curtailment directives under the current Modified IV Category Plan. Where the customer's normal operational pressure requirements exceed the delivery pressure available, thus requiring the installation of increased compressor capacity, a pressure factor (corresponding to the psig) will be used to calculate the actual monthly consumption to be billed. 
g.  In the event a maximum daily quantity (MDQ) overrun penalty is levied against the city, due, in part or in whole, to industrial delivery overruns, the industry will pay a daily overrun penalty of one dollar ($1.00) per one hundred (100) cubic feet against all units in excess of the industry's established MDQ in addition to the established rate. 
(11)  Gas rate adjustments: The foregoing retail rate schedules shall be subject to adjustment, if the wholesale rate goes up or down, the wholesale percentage will be passed through to the retail customer. Adjustments to the base retail rate schedules listed above shall be performed, in the absence of a formal rate hearing, in accordance with either one or both of the formulas set out below in subsection (10)a, gas cost adjustment (GCA), and (10)b, revenue requirement adjustment. A formal rate hearing shall be held at least once every two (2) years, or in the event that total adjustments to the base retail rate schedules reach or exceed twenty cents ($0.20) per one hundred (100) cubic feet, to review and adjust the base retail rates above, and also the adjustment formulas as required. 
a.  Gas cost adjustment (GCA): 
Schedule GCA shall provide for the monthly fluctuation in wholesale purchased gas costs as reflected in the monthly quote received from BP Energy Company ("BP"). The GCA shall also account for any changes in monthly gas transportation costs. In the event schedule GCA results in a negative factor, such negative GCA factor shall be applied to each customer's monthly bill. All GCA factors shall be rounded off to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent ($0.00) per one hundred (100) cubic feet sold. 
The GCA shall be calculated based on the current billing period's wholesale gas cost anticipated to be billed by supplier(s) (e.g., BP), plus anticipated gas transportation charges, adjusted to the retail billing level as follows: 
GCA = [(PGC + GTC) × 1.032 × (1/1-RAF) / 10] - BGC 
Where: 
PGC = Purchased gas cost for the coming billing period stated in dollars per MMBtu (million British Thermal Units). PGC includes the commodity cost of gas and all applicable taxes and surcharges. 
GTC = Gas transportation cost for the coming billing period stated in dollars per MMBtu. 
RAF = Retail adjustment factor to adjust the dollars per MCF charge to the retail billing level, currently 0.05. RAF may be adjusted from time to time based on actual experience. 
BGC = The cost of delivered gas in current base rates ($0.56 per CCF). BGC shall remain unchanged until the next the revision to base rates. 
b.  Labor cost adjustment (LCA) factor . The base rates set forth above may be adjusted periodically to account for permanent changes in labor-related revenue requirements (e.g., salaries and wages, pensions and benefits, etc.) that come about as a result of budget actions taken by the city council for a fiscal year. Such adjustment, when approved by the city council, shall be calculated as follows: 
LCA = 1 + ((TLCB - TLCBR)/BRRR) 
Where: 
TLCB = The total annual labor cost, in dollars, that is reflected in the gas utility budget for the coming fiscal year, as approved by the board. 
TLCBR = The total annual labor cost, in dollars, that is reflected in the current base gas rates. 
BRRR = The total revenue requirement, in dollars, that is reflected in current base gas rates. 
The LCA factor so calculated shall be applied to each retail rate set forth above, excluding Schedule GCA, such that it will result in new base gas rates. Thus, when applied, a new TLCBR and BRRR will be established for future LCA calculations. The following accounts shall be used in the determination of total labor costs as reflected in TLCB and TLCBR: 
Collection costs/revenue department 
Administrative costs 
Salaries 
Payroll taxes 
Retirement expense 
Employee retirement/medical insurance 
Casualty/workers compensation insurance 
c.  Revenue requirement adjustment (RRA): 
RRA = (EO - $5,986,000) + (EG - $1,307,600) / RS 
EG is new or budgeted annual contributions to the Fairhope general fund; 
EO is estimated or budgeted annual operation and maintenance costs for the next twelve (12) months; 
RS is total annual Fairhope retail sales, excluding city use, in CCf estimated for the next twelve (12) months. 
(12)  The foregoing retail rate schedule shall be further subject to adjustment in certain areas defined and specified as subject to the competitive rate environment. Such areas are those in which the city is competing or will have to compete with other gas suppliers for market share. The purpose of this discretion to adjust rates in the defined area or areas is to enhance the municipal utility's ability to successfully compete and gain market share.

b.  Bills are payable within ten (10) days from due date and, if not paid within such period, may be increased by an amount to be determined by council. 
c.  When applicable, a service charge will be applied by the city gas department for calls made when interruption of service is not the fault of the city. 
d.  Retail service to more than one premises (unless served through one meter) shall not be combined, nor shall it be shared with or resold to others. 
e.  In the event the supply of natural gas to the city is curtailed or if the total supply is inadequate, only high-priority customers shall continue to receive service in accordance with the city's curtailment plan. A high-priority customer includes users of gas in a residence, small commercial establishment, school, hospital or similar institution, or any use where curtailment would endanger life, health, welfare or maintenance of physical property due to the unavailability of an alternate energy supply. 
f.  Normal service and delivery pressure to the customer shall be determined by the pressure available in the city's mains at the customer's location and may be reduced as necessary by the city to comply with supplier and regulatory curtailment directives under the current Modified IV Category Plan. Where the customer's normal operational pressure requirements exceed the delivery pressure available, thus requiring the installation of increased compressor capacity, a pressure factor (corresponding to the psig) will be used to calculate the actual monthly consumption to be billed. 
g.  In the event a maximum daily quantity (MDQ) overrun penalty is levied against the city, due, in part or in whole, to industrial delivery overruns, the industry will pay a daily overrun penalty of one dollar ($1.00) per one hundred (100) cubic feet against all units in excess of the industry's established MDQ in addition to the established rate. 
(11)  Gas rate adjustments: The foregoing retail rate schedules shall be subject to adjustment, if the wholesale rate goes up or down, the wholesale percentage will be passed through to the retail customer. Adjustments to the base retail rate schedules listed above shall be performed, in the absence of a formal rate hearing, in accordance with either one or both of the formulas set out below in subsection (10)a, gas cost adjustment (GCA), and (10)b, revenue requirement adjustment. A formal rate hearing shall be held at least once every two (2) years, or in the event that total adjustments to the base retail rate schedules reach or exceed twenty cents ($0.20) per one hundred (100) cubic feet, to review and adjust the base retail rates above, and also the adjustment formulas as required. 
a.  Gas cost adjustment (GCA): 
Schedule GCA shall provide for the monthly fluctuation in wholesale purchased gas costs as reflected in the monthly quote received from BP Energy Company ("BP"). The GCA shall also account for any changes in monthly gas transportation costs. In the event schedule GCA results in a negative factor, such negative GCA factor shall be applied to each customer's monthly bill. All GCA factors shall be rounded off to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent ($0.00) per one hundred (100) cubic feet sold. 
The GCA shall be calculated based on the current billing period's wholesale gas cost anticipated to be billed by supplier(s) (e.g., BP), plus anticipated gas transportation charges, adjusted to the retail billing level as follows: 
GCA = [(PGC + GTC) × 1.032 × (1/1-RAF) / 10] - BGC 
Where: 
PGC = Purchased gas cost for the coming billing period stated in dollars per MMBtu (million British Thermal Units). PGC includes the commodity cost of gas and all applicable taxes and surcharges. 
GTC = Gas transportation cost for the coming billing period stated in dollars per MMBtu. 
RAF = Retail adjustment factor to adjust the dollars per MCF charge to the retail billing level, currently 0.05. RAF may be adjusted from time to time based on actual experience. 
BGC = The cost of delivered gas in current base rates ($0.56 per CCF). BGC shall remain unchanged until the next the revision to base rates. 
b.  Labor cost adjustment (LCA) factor . The base rates set forth above may be adjusted periodically to account for permanent changes in labor-related revenue requirements (e.g., salaries and wages, pensions and benefits, etc.) that come about as a result of budget actions taken by the city council for a fiscal year. Such adjustment, when approved by the city council, shall be calculated as follows: 
LCA = 1 + ((TLCB - TLCBR)/BRRR) 
Where: 
TLCB = The total annual labor cost, in dollars, that is reflected in the gas utility budget for the coming fiscal year, as approved by the board. 
TLCBR = The total annual labor cost, in dollars, that is reflected in the current base gas rates. 
BRRR = The total revenue requirement, in dollars, that is reflected in current base gas rates. 
The LCA factor so calculated shall be applied to each retail rate set forth above, excluding Schedule GCA, such that it will result in new base gas rates. Thus, when applied, a new TLCBR and BRRR will be established for future LCA calculations. The following accounts shall be used in the determination of total labor costs as reflected in TLCB and TLCBR: 
Collection costs/revenue department 
Administrative costs 
Salaries 
Payroll taxes 
Retirement expense 
Employee retirement/medical insurance 
Casualty/workers compensation insurance 
c.  Revenue requirement adjustment (RRA): 
RRA = (EO - $5,986,000) + (EG - $1,307,600) / RS 
EG is new or budgeted annual contributions to the Fairhope general fund; 
EO is estimated or budgeted annual operation and maintenance costs for the next twelve (12) months; 
RS is total annual Fairhope retail sales, excluding city use, in CCf estimated for the next twelve (12) months. 
(12)  The foregoing retail rate schedule shall be further subject to adjustment in certain areas defined and specified as subject to the competitive rate environment. Such areas are those in which the city is competing or will have to compete with other gas suppliers for market share. The purpose of this discretion to adjust rates in the defined area or areas is to enhance the municipal utility's ability to successfully compete and gain market share.

Sec. 21-114. - Procedure for remedying franchise violations. 
    In accordance with the regulations, the following shall apply but shall not be an exclusive remedy: 
(a)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that grantee has violated any provision of this franchise agreement or the regulations, the city shall first notify the grantee of the violation and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than twenty (20) days in the case of the failure of a grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the city under this franchise, and thirty (30) days in all other cases, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. If a grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if a grantee is unable to correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less than twenty (20) days of a public hearing to be held before the council. Said notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. 
(b)  At the public hearing, the council shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence. 
(c)  In the event the city finds that a grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the city and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation, or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(d)  In the event the city finds that a violation exists and that a grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently proceed to correct the violation, the city may impose liquidated damages assessable from the security fund in section 2.6 [sic] of this franchise, as follows: 
(1)  For system construction schedule violations including, but not limited to, provisions relating to initial construction schedule or system upgrade construction schedule, one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day of noncompliance. 
(2)  For all other violations, two hundred dollars ($200.00) per day per violation. 
The grantee acknowledges that the damages that may be incurred by the city as a result of a violation of this agreement or the regulations may be difficult to determine and further agrees that these liquidated damage amounts are not intended as a penalty, but rather represent an estimate of the damage that might be incurred by the city and that said amounts are fair and reasonable. Grantee further agrees that the liquidated damage provisions herein shall not in any way be a limit against actual damages recoverable by the city as a result of any such violation by grantee and that the amount of liquidated damages imposed against the grantee shall be in addition to any monetary obligations that are owed by grantee under this agreement or the regulations. 
(e)  If the city elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute the city's exclusive remedy for a period of sixty (60) days. Thereafter, if grantee remains in noncompliance, the city may pursue any other available remedies under this article, the regulations or under other applicable laws. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of a grantee, the security fund deposited pursuant to this article shall remain in effect and available to the city until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any remaining amounts in the security fund shall revert to the possession of the grantee. 
(g)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund or bond requirement as set forth in this article are in addition to all other rights of city, whether reserved by this article or the regulations, or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the city may have. 
(h)  In instances of repeated violations, whether remedied or not, the city shall serve special notice outlining additional remediation requirements. Failure to cure, measured by repeated instances of the same violation, shall be evidence of an evasive practice and may lead to revocation under section 11 of the regulations [section 21-123 of this article].

(d)  Effect of acceptance. Subject to applicable law, no acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release of or an accord of satisfaction of any claim the city might have for further or additional sums payable under the terms of the franchise or for any performance or obligation of grantee thereunder. 
(e)  [Fees in addition to taxes.] The payment of any and all fees by grantee, is in addition to any ad valorem tax which the city may levy upon the grantee's real or personal property, and is in addition to any other tax which may lawfully be levied by other governmental entities.

If the subscriber telephone is answered by a machine or service, the grantee must leave a message with a direct or separate dispatch number the subscriber may use to call back to confirm or reschedule the appointment. 
(g)  Appointments may not be canceled or rescheduled until field personnel of the grantee make every reasonable effort to verify that the subscriber or other authorized adult is not at the address for the appointment. 
(h)  Upon verification that a subscriber is not at the address during the scheduled appointment window, the grantee shall leave a door tag or similar notice with the name of the person leaving the notice, the time the person determined that the subscriber was not at home; and a telephone number the subscriber may call back to confirm or reschedule an appointment. 
(i)  Any vehicle used for the installation, construction, maintenance, or repair of a cable system shall bear the identification of the contractor or the applicable grantee in a conspicuous place and manner.

(2)  A problem established as having been noncable in origin. 
(h)  An "identified outage" is construed as reports of no picture/no sound from three (3) or more subscribers in close geographic proximity or along the same trunk or feeder line within twenty (20) minutes of each other. 
(i)  Within ten (10) minutes of an identified outage, the grantee will post appropriate messages, including areas or zip codes affected, on an automatic response unit or phone system. Such messages should also provide instructions for subscribers whose navigation devices may have become deauthorized as a result of the outage. 
(j)  Within one (1) hour of an identified outage, service technicians will respond and use all available reasonable means to correct the outage in the shortest possible amount of time. The grantee shall maintain and forward to the city upon request reports on the cause, area, duration and repair of the outage. 
(k)  Cable drop lines, cable trunk lines, or any other type of outside wiring that comprise part of the grantee's cable system that are located underground, shall be placed in such locations pursuant to city code, and the surrounding ground shall be restored as close as is practical to the condition to which it existed immediately prior to such construction within seventy-two (72) hours after connection to the cable system, or such time as agreed to by the property owner. Additional time may be allowed for the completion of such restoration if individual circumstances warrant. Except for the grantee's maintenance facilities, no cable drop line, cable trunk line, or any other type of outside wiring shall be permitted to lay upon the ground within the city, except for the express purpose of being immediately connected to the cable system of the grantee. The requirements of this subsection shall apply to all installation, reinstallation, service or repair commenced by the grantee within the city during normal operating conditions. The city shall determine in its sole discretion whether operating conditions were not within the control of the grantee.

Secs. 21-144-21-165. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VIII. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM 

Sec. 21-166. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known as the identity theft prevention program. 
(Ord. No. 1386, § I, 4-27-09) 
Sec. 21-167. - Program purpose and definitions. 
(a)  Fulfilling requirements of the red flags rule. Under the red flag rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: 
(1)  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
(2)  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
(3)  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
(4)  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
(b)  Red flags rule definitions used in this program. The red flags rule defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
    The city is a user of consumer reports that are subject to administrative enforcement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to 15 U.S. Code §1681s(a)(1), subject to the rule requirements. The city maintains covered accounts that are subject to the rule requirements, i.e. utility accounts. In some programs, the city extends credit to individuals. The city also maintains customer accounts in revenue programs, in collection of garbage fees, in collection of fines and costs in municipal court, and in collections of charges for miscellaneous services. 
    All the city's accounts that are individual garbage collection fee service accounts held by customers of the city are covered by the rule. Under the rule, a "covered account" is: 
(1)  Any account offered or maintained primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and 
(2)  Any other account offered or maintained for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the city from identity theft. 
    "Identifying information" is defined under the rule as "any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person," including: name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's Internet Protocol address, or routing code." 
(Ord. No. 1386, § II, 4-27-09) 
Sec. 21-168. - Identification of red flags. 
    In order to identify relevant red flags, the city considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft. The city identifies the following red flags, in each of the listed categories: 
(a)  Notifications and warnings from credit reporting agencies. 
(1)  Report of fraud accompanying a credit report; 
(2)  Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a customer or applicant; 
(3)  Notice or report from a credit agency of an active duty alert for an applicant; and 
(4)  Indication from a credit report of activity that is inconsistent with a customer's usual pattern or activity. 
(b)  Suspicious documents. 
(1)  Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered or inauthentic; 
(2)  Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document; 
(3)  Other document with information that is not consistent with existing customer information (such as if a person's signature on a check appears forged); and 
(4)  Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged. 
(c)  Suspicious personal identifying information. 
(1)  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates);

Sec. 21-172. - Program updates. 
    This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the city from identity theft. At least annually, the mayor will consider the city's experiences with identity theft situation, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the city maintains and changes in the city's business arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, the mayor will determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are warranted.

(Ord. No. 1386, § VII, 4-27-09)

The mayor will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of city staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training and reports.

In the event the city engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one (1) or more accounts, the city will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
(1)  Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract, that service providers review the city's program and report any red flags to the mayor. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the city's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices is to be limited to the identity theft committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

applicable ordinances and regulations; i.e. lot line adjustment.
Resources: the following resources were used as an aide in developing these
regulations and may be consulted for guidance and support in implementing the goals
and purposes of these regulations. However, these resources shall not be used to
contradict or conflict with any standards expressed in these regulations. Traditional
Neighborhood Development, Street Design Guidelines, Institute of Transportation
Engineers, October 1999; Residential Streets, Third Edition, ULI, HAHB, ASCE,
and ITE, 2001; Traffic Calming: State of the Practice, ITE & FHWA, August 1999;

Bicycle Improvements as the Local Level, FHWA Report, 1998.
Retention Facility: a storm water management facility that provides storage of storm
water runoff and is designed to eliminate subsequent surface discharges from the
property. These facilities are sometimes effective in reducing downstream flooding
because they do not allow discharge of storm water runoff to downstream locations
except in extreme flood events where the storage volume of the facility is exceeded.
Retention facilities can also be effective in reducing surface water storm water
pollution since the pollutants contained in storm water are not released downstream.
Right-of-way: a strip of land acquired by the City by reservation, dedication, forced
dedication, prescription, or condemnation and intended to be occupied by a street,
crosswalk, sidewalk, planting strip, median, bike lanes, railroad, utility transmission

Sidewalk: the portion of the right-of-way paved for the use as a walkway for
pedestrians.
Specifications, State: shall mean the latest revision of the Alabama Highway
Department Specifications for Roads and Bridges.
Streambank Protection Volume: the volume of storm water that a storm water conveyance
system can handle when the water elevation is at the top of the channel banks. It is also
referred to as bankfull flow. Any increase to the volume of water from a development results
in increased frequency and duration of bankfull flow downstream of the development. This
increase in frequency and duration of bankfull flow is the primary cause of accelerated
erosion and widening of stream channels.
Streamside Buffer (Buffer): an area adjacent to a shoreline, wetland or stream where
development is restricted or prohibited; an area of transition between a developed
area and a natural resource.
Street: the portion of the right-of-way paved for vehicular traffic, parking, or the
shared use of bicycles.
Street Width: the entire width of the traveled right of way dedicated for vehicular
traffic, either from the back of the curb or the edge of the traveled surface on each
side of such street.
Storm water Quality Volume: the first flush concept is based on the theory that a
disproportionate amount of pollutant removal from storm water runoff occurs early in each
rainfall event. The variable typically used to identify the first flush is a specific rainfall
depth. For purposes of these regulations the rainfall depth associated with first flush is 1.8
inches.
Subdivider: a landowner applying for a subdivision, or the landowners agent.
Subdivision: this term shall have the meaning ascribed to it in § 11-52-1 of the
Alabama Code (1975), as the same shall hereafter be altered, amended or otherwise
replaced.
Subdivision, Major: (See Major Subdivision)
Subdivision, Minor: (See Minor Subdivision)
Surface Drainage: a storm-water drainage system consisting of natural systems
and/or constructed elements including berms, swales, gutters, culverts and open
channels.
Top of Bank: the uppermost limit of the active channel of the stream containing
normal flows usually marked by a break in the slope. If the top of bank is

indistinguishable, an authority designated by the Planning Director or his authorized
agent will be assigned to make the official determination.
Waiver: a request for the non-application of a standard contained in these
regulations, granted at the discretion of the Planning Commission through a separate
procedure, based on criteria unique to the specific site.
Watercourse: any depression serving to give direction to a flow of water, having a
bed and well-defined banks and which shall, upon the rule or order of the Planning
Commission also include other generally or specifically designated areas where
flooding may occur. The flow of water need not be on a continuous basis, but may
be intermittent, resulting from the surface runoff of precipitation.
Wetlands: areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support and that under normal circumstances do
support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions as delineated by the Corps of Engineers. Wetlands generally include
swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
Watershed: the area of land that drains to a particular point on a stream or storm water
conveyance system.

FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 16
h. Traffic Data and Traffic Study  Applications shall include trip generation data
showing the projected average daily traffic (ADT) in a 24-hour period and projected
peak-hour traffic generated by the development in the subdivision application. Peak
hour traffic shall generally be the hours between 7 A.M. and 9 A.M. for morning and
4 P.M. and 6 P.M. for the evening and include the consecutive 60 minute segment in
which traffic counts are projected to occur. In instances where the proposed
application will have peak periods that differ from the general peak periods above,
the Planning Commission may require that the analysis be conducted for the
alternative peak periods. Trip generation data shall be based on the most recent
edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip Generation Manual or actual data
about similar developments in Alabama with the same types of uses and site
conditions. A traffic study shall be required for all applications that will generate an
average daily traffic (ADT) count of 1,000 trips or more, or which will generate 50
trips or more during any peak hour period. An agent selected by the City and paid
for by the applicant shall perform the traffic study. The traffic study shall be used to
determine what on-site and off-site street or traffic improvements may be necessary
due to the development. The Planning Commission may condition the approval of
the application on the applicant paying for or constructing those improvements or
portions of improvements that are needed due to the traffic impact of the application
based on all potential land uses. The traffic study shall include the following data
along with an analysis of the data:
(1) Estimates of trip generation for the proposed development showing projected
inbound and outbound vehicle trips for morning and evening peak periods to
identify the maximum combined hourly traffic volume associated with the
peaking characteristics of the site development combined with the adjacent street
traffic.
(2) Projected traffic impact and trip distribution on existing and planned streets
within the development and at major signalized and unsignalized intersections
within ½ mile of the project site (study area) areas likely to be impacted by the
development. Intersections of particular concern to the City may be added or
omitted from the traffic study at the direction of the Planning Director;
(3) Assignment of trips generated by the proposed development on existing and
planned streets within the development and areas likely to be impacted by the
development and within the project study area;
(4) Intersection turning movements and traffic counts on all existing and planned
intersections likely to be impacted by the proposed development. Traffic counts
must be less than 3 years old to be used as base volumes for the traffic analysis;
(5) Corresponding intersection levels of services shall be calculated for the peak
periods for the intersections within the study area, utilizing the Highway
Capacity Software (HCS) latest version, or Synchro traffic software, for the
existing conditions and opening year of the project site. Intersections shall be
considered deficient if Level of Service (LOS) D is exceeded, and improvements
to meet this LOS threshold shall be identified;
(6) Site access volumes and major unsignalized intersections within the study area
shall be evaluated using the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD) to demonstrate the need for installation of a traffic control signal,
(7) Auxiliary turn lane requirements shall be evaluated at the site access points to
identify if right turn and left turn ingress lanes are needed. Site access points that
generate 40 or more right turns in one hour will be required to construct a right
turn ingress lane. The need for constructing a left turn ingress lane shall be
considered based on the Appendix criteria for left turn lane warrants;
Article IV Section C.

assessors office, which will be certified or otherwise verified by the County, on the
tax records of the County.
j. The applicant shall post on any specific property, which is the subject of the
application, on a sign facing each adjacent public street. The sign shall be furnished
by the City at the time of application giving notice of the hearing. The sign shall be
posted no later than 15 days prior to the hearing before the Planning Commission. It
is the sole responsibility of the applicant to post the sign in accordance with these
regulations. Failure to post this sign may result in nullification of the subdivision
application and approval.
k. In the case of applications for a preliminary plat outside the City limits but within the
jurisdiction of these regulations, the applicant shall be required to submit evidence in
writing that plans for the subdivision shall have been received by the County
Engineer for his/her review.
l. Filing fee as specified in the Citys most recent schedule of fees.
2. Staff review  Applicants for a preliminary plat shall first submit the preliminary plat and
plans to the Planning Director and/or his/her authorized agent for staffs review. The
Director shall determine if the submittals meet all of the requirements of Section C.1.,
above. Incomplete, partial, or inaccurate submittals will not be accepted, but will be
returned to applicant for re-submission for a later hearing. Staff shall review the
application and provide comments to the applicant. Following staff review and
comments the applicant shall submit revised drawings for review by staff and the
Planning Commission. The revised plans submitted shall reflect staffs initial review
comments.
3. Planning Commission Hearing and Review  Complete formal applications will be
placed on the next available Planning Commission agenda for submittal to the Planning
Commission and a hearing and review by the Planning Commission. Notice shall be sent
to the applicant and owners of land immediately adjoining the platted land stating the
time and place of the hearing. The applicant shall post on any specific property, which is
the subject of the application, on a sign facing each adjacent public street. The sign shall
be furnished by the City at the time of application giving notice of the hearing. The sign
shall be posted no later than 15 days prior to the hearing before the Planning
Commission. It is the sole responsibility of the applicant to post the sign in accordance
with these regulations. Failure to post this sign may result in nullification of the
subdivision application and approval.
4. Planning Commission Decision 
a. After review of the proposed preliminary plat by the Planning Commission,
the Planning Commission may:
(1) Approve the preliminary plat;
(2) Approve the preliminary plat with conditions;
(3) Deny the preliminary plat with stated reason(s) for denial; or
(4) Table the application for further study and additional information.
b. Preliminary plat approval shall not constitute final acceptance of the
subdivision and the approval shall not be endorsed upon the plat. As
Article IV Section C.
Procedure for Plat Approval Preliminary Plat
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 18
provided by state law, these regulations require tentative or preliminary
approval of a subdivision before installation of streets and utilities.
c. There is no provision for automatic preliminary approval upon the failure or
refusal of the commission to act on a preliminary plat. The applicant's
alternative in such case is to finalize the plat, post a financial guaranty as
provided by law to ensure installation of improvements and then to apply for
final plat approval.
d. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the sub-divider may apply for a Preconstruction
Conference and install all required improvements in substantial
conformity of all requirements of the regulations, applicable codes, and laws, and
apply for final plat approval
e. When the Planning Commission denies a preliminary plat, no further subdivision
applications affecting the same parcel or a portion thereof will be considered by the
Commission within 180 days from the date of such denial, unless all of the following
occur:
(1) A new preliminary plat application is submitted which clearly corrects, resolves,
or mitigates all of the design standard deficiencies and/or other reasons which were
the basis of the original preliminary plat denial; and
(2) A new, complete application and fees are submitted.
f. Upon the decision rendered by the Planning Commission, the Planning Department
will issue a letter to the applicant regarding the official decision of the Planning
Commission.
5. Pre-construction Conference  An onsite pre-construction conference with City
representatives is required prior to initiation of any land disturbance activities.
Construction of said improvements shall in no way obligate the Commission to grant
Final Approval of the Plat, nor shall it obligate the City Council to accept such
improvements for public maintenance. No owner or developer shall proceed with any
site work under authority of preliminary plat approval until the completion of the preconstruction
conference.
6. Expiration and Revocation -
a. Any substantial deviation from the approved submittals during construction or failure
to provide for traffic control, safety, environmental protection controls and/or best
management practices and restoration of the site shall be grounds for the immediate
suspension of the Preliminary Plat Approval and/or issuance of a stop work order.
The Planning Commission shall have the power to reinstate Preliminary Approval
when it is satisfied that conditions resulting in suspension have been mitigated.
b. If a final plat is not submitted within two years or less after preliminary approval has
been given, the preliminary approval shall expire and the preliminary plat shall be
null, void and of no force or effect.
D. FINAL PLAT:
Prior to expiration of preliminary plat approval, applicant may submit eighteen (18) copies of
the Final Plat to the commission staff for review and, if in compliance, placement on the
commission agenda.

NATURAL OPEN SPACE
Preserve
An undeveloped area that
contains significant natural
features or habitat worthy of
preservation. Features such
as large stands of trees, water
elements, or prominent
topography characterize
preserves. A preserve may
by use for passive recreation
or as a scenic and visual
buffer. It generally contains
little or no constructed
improvements although trails
may access the preserve.
Preserves may be
located in
development type
based natural
features and the
required level of
preservation of
natural
characteristics
required.
The size of a
Preserve open space
should be based on
the site
characteristics and
potential continuity
of natural features in
the area along with
the potential to
connect to adjacent
natural areas.
Trail /
Greenway
An undeveloped area of
continuous linear natural
features, often following a
stream or floodplain. A trail
or greenway should be
usable for recreation and
non-motorized
transportation. It includes
few constructed
improvements except for
those to enhance travel or
recreational use.
Trail and Greenway
system may be
located in any
development type
based on linkages to
proposed or existing
trail / greenway
networks.
Generally, should
include at least 3
acres but should be
sized and located
based on providing
significant
continuity
throughout a
development and to
areas beyond the
development area.
Must be at least 30
wide at all locations.
Park
An undeveloped natural area
for unstructured recreation.
A park may include some
areas for structured
recreation, such as ball
fields, but generally this area
should occupy no more than
25% of the total area. Parks
are located based on the
presence of natural features
or based on convenience for
surrounding residents. A
park has a predominantly
natural landscape although
portions may be designed for
aesthetic and recreation
purposes, particularly for
parks located due to
convenience.
Parks may be
located in rural and
suburban areas.
At least 3 acres

CIVIC OPEN SPACE
Green
An open space for
unstructured recreation or
aesthetic landscaping. A green
is bordered by public rights-ofway
on at least 2 sides, front
building facades, and formal
landscaped elements to define
its boundaries. Generally,
there are few constructed
elements except as a formal
entry to or a focal point for the
green. Must be specially
defined by landscaping.
Predominantly
located in
residential
neighborhoods
of suburban or
urban character.
¼ to 3 acres
Plaza
An open space for civic
purposes and commercial
activities. A plaza is bordered
by public rights-of-way on at
least 2 sides, and building
facades to define its
boundaries. It is largely
constructed of materials to
withstand heavy pedestrian
traffic, but contains
intermittent lawns, landscape
beds, or trees in a formal
pattern.
Plazas should be
located at the
intersection of
important streets
in areas
designated
village centers
and areas of
urban character.
1/8 to 2 acres
The size of plazas is
generally
determined by the
height of
surrounding
buildings,
maintaining
between a 1:3 and
1:6 ratio of building
height to plaza.
Courtyard
A small open space accessible
to the public but generally
serving one or a few
surrounding buildings.
Courtyards are primarily
bordered by building facades,
but have at least one side fully
or partially boarded by a
public right-of-way.
Courtyards are often
constructed of materials to
withstand heavy pedestrian
traffic but contain intermittent
formal landscape elements.
Courtyards
should be
located in urban
areas and
village centers.
1000 square feet to
1/8 acre
The size of
courtyards is
generally
determined by the
height of
surrounding
buildings,
maintaining a
between a 2:1 and
1:3 ratio of building
height to courtyard.
Playground
Open space designed and
equipped for structured
recreation. Playgrounds are
often boarded by a fence or
other private boundary (as in
the case of a playground
internal to a block) but are
accessible by common
pedestrian path.
Alternatively, playgrounds
included as part of a larger
civic or natural open space do
not necessarily have borders.
Playgrounds
may be located
in any open
space type.
1000 square feet to
¼ acres.
A playground may
be part of larger
civic or natural open
space.

Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 36
5. Street Design  The following are minimum
standards. All construction, radii, and other
specifications of the city are required to be met.
<< Figure 5.1 >>
a. In those locations that a public street is
adjacent to the required greenspace, it is
permissible to construct a street according to
the following standards:
(1) ROW: 50 feet
(2) Paved: 18 feet minimum
(3) On Street Parking: Posted one side;
minimum width of 7 feet for parking;
spaces must be painted on the paved
surface.
(4) Signage: The street must be posted as a
one-way street.
b. In those instances where it is permissible to construct a smaller street the
following design guidelines must be adhered to:
1) There shall be no cul-de-sac;
2) The street must provide thru access; and
3) Valley gutter, roll down, or saucer type curbs designed and constructed
to City standards may be used adjacent to the park area.
6. Phased Project - Where a project is proposed to be phased, all or part of the
greenspace areas may be located at the edge of the first phase as long as
additional greenspace from future phases will be contiguous and in addition to
that required on the first phase. All of the design requirements indicated above
shall be applicable to any and all phased development. The percentage of
greenspace shall be calculated on a cumulative basis in order to ensure that the
greenspace requirement is met. Previously dedicated greenspace shall be
subtracted from the minimum total percentage to ensure that the minimum
percentage required by City is not exceeded.
7. Greenspace Maintenance - All required greenspace shall be indicated on the
recorded plat as a public access and use easement. The plat must also have a note
that the property is not dedicated to the City of Fairhope and that the City of
Fairhope is not responsible for maintenance of any or all required greenspace.
Lakes, ponds, watercourses or similar sites will be accepted for maintenance only
if sufficient land is dedicated as a public recreation area, park or open space.
Such areas must be approved by the Recreation Board and accepted by the City
Council before approval of the plat.

Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 37
8. Hardship - Where there are unique and inherent characteristics of the land
proposed for development, the Planning Commission may, by vote, reduce the
greenspace requirements in whole or part.
The Commission, however, may not
require additional land area as is stated in
Section C 2. However, a reduction of the
greenspace requirements is totally
contingent on the unique qualities of the
land that are inherent, not man made, and
would deprive a property owner of a
reasonable return on the use of the land. It
is the sole responsibility of the property
owner to portray any and all hardships to
the Planning Commission for final
determination.
D. STREET STANDARDS:
1. Purpose  These street standards shall
implement the Comprehensive Plan for the
physical development of the City by setting
the location, character and extent of streets,
boulevards, parkways, and other public
ways to promote good civic design and
arrangement. This design and arrangement
shall ensure proper arrangement of streets
in relation to other existing or planned
streets and the Comprehensive Plan.
Commentary
Block size limits create a pedestrian scale
while providing multiple connections for all
of the shared users of the street. Streets are
to be interconnected by a modified grid,
where arterial and collector streets provide
direct and continuous routes for users of the
streets and local streets provide multiple
indirect connections for residents of the
neighborhoods. Local streets should remain
connected to the grid yet discourage large
volumes of through traffic by incorporating
design elements. Additionally, the character
of all streets should be transitional rather
than hierarchical; street character and
design should transition to function
appropriately with the adjoining land use
rather than establish the character of
adjoining land uses in a strip pattern along a
hierarchy of streets. Design elements should
be incorporated into the street design to
insure that function and design speeds for the
various streets are maintained and that
streets support the adjoining land use.
Further, the grid should be modified when
natural or topographical features worthy of
preservation are encountered.
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 38
These standards shall promote the following goals in the Comprehensive
Plan: (a) implement compact, walkable neighborhoods; (b) support the
development of a comprehensive bicycle and pedestrian network with linkages
between residential and commercial areas; (c) provide a pleasant and diverse
pedestrian experience; (d) create a defined system of streets that serves the needs
of pedestrians and vehicles equitably, providing multiple routes where possible
and encourages street and sidewalk connections; (e) connect streets, sidewalks,
neighborhoods, and districts both physically and perceptually; (f) guide growth to
locations that can be efficiently and effectively served by the City in
transportation and infrastructure, and which strengthens the linkage between
historic Fairhope and new development; (g) cluster mixed-use, neighborhood
village centers at or near the intersections of arterial streets; and (h) ensure that
village centers have identifiable centers and edges, and ensure pedestrian
accessibility.
2. Street Classification and Function Streets in all subdivisions shall be classified
in one of the following categories. Each category shall serve the specified
functions and support the described adjacent land uses.
Table 5.2
Classification Functions Adjacent Land Uses
Arterial street ? Land access
? Pedestrian/bicycle
mobility
? Parking
? Vehicle mobility
? Mixed-use village centers, commercial, retail, and office uses only
on blocks served by two arterial streets. Blocks within 880 feet of
the intersection of two arterial streets and immediately adjacent to a
block currently used or planned for such uses, may also be used for
mixed-use village centers, commercial, retail, and office uses.
? Public and institutional uses
? Residential uses

3. Street Layout  Streets in all proposed subdivisions shall be laid out according to
the standards in this section. For the purposes of this section, planned, platted, or
Commentary
Table 5.2 requires that land uses and the transportation system are integrated. Uses that are attractors of
vehicle trips from outside the neighborhood should be accessible by two arterial streets. This ensures
proper civic design and the proper arrangement of streets to handle traffic within the overall
transportation system. These uses, including commercial, retail, office, and mixed use village centers,
shall be located on blocks served by two arterial streets, or in the case of build out of such a block, the
immediately adjacent block.
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 39
existing streets on adjacent lands shall be used to determine that the street layout
for the proposed subdivision is in compliance with
this section. Distances shall be measured from the
centerline of all proposed, planned, platted or
existing streets. << Figure 5.2 >>
a. Arterial Streets  All proposed subdivisions
shall have an Arterial Street at least every 1 ¼
miles (6600) but no two non-intersecting
arterial streets shall be closer than ¾ mile
(3960) from each other at any point. Arterial
streets shall be an extension and continuation
of any existing arterial streets in adjoining
areas.
b. Collector Streets - All proposed subdivisions
shall have a Collector Street at least every 5/8
mile (3300) but no two non-intersecting
collector streets shall be closer than 3/8 mile
(1980) at any point. Arterial streets in
compliance with section D.2.a. shall count as
collector streets for the purposes of this section. Collector streets shall be an
extension and continuation of any existing collector streets in adjoining areas
c. Local Streets  All proposed subdivisions shall have a Local Street at least
every 1/8 mile (660) for residential subdivisions and at least every 1/12 mile
(440) for non-residential subdivisions, but no two non-intersecting local
streets shall be closer than 220 feet at any point. Arterial streets in
compliance with section D.2.a. and collector streets in compliance with
section D.2.b. shall count as local streets for the purposes of this section.
d. Lanes  Lanes providing only access to lots may be located through the
middle of a block, between any two adjacent non-intersecting streets.
e. Access to Adjacent Property - Street connections to abutting properties shall
be provided at least at intervals not to exceed the maximum block length
specified in Section D.4., by extension of a paved street that meets City
construction requirements to the boundary of the
abutting property. A temporary turnaround shall
be provided for those streets subject to the
following:
(1) A circular turnaround with a diameter of 30
to 42 feet. If a center island is provide in the
turnaround, the outside diameter shall be 45
feet with a 20 to 24 foot lane maintained at
all times. Circular turnarounds may be
designed to incorporate a future traffic circle
or roundabout, as provided in Article V.,
Section D.5.h., when future streets will
intersect at that point. << Figure 5.3 >>
(2) For extensions serving 5 lots or more, a culde-
sac shall be required. Permanent deadend
streets shall not exceed 1,320 feet (1/4
mile) in length. Permanent dead-end
streets with a pavement width of 20 feet or
less shall be provided with a turnaround

frequent but continuous arterial streets,
moderately frequent and moderately
continuous collector streets, and frequent
but less continuous local streets  all
interconnected.

Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 40
having a roadway diameter of at lease 70 feet and a right-of-way
diameter of at least 100 feet. Permanent dead-end streets with a
pavement width of more than 20 feet shall be provided with a turnaround
having a roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and a right-of-way diameter
of at least 100 feet.
At non-permanent dead-end street, provide a temporary turn-around with
at least a 70 diameter constructed with an all weather surface.
(3) For street extensions serving four or fewer lots, no temporary turnaround
is required.
(4) All access streets to adjacent property that are not connected at the time
of the improvements shall be posted with a stop sign blank reading
"Future Through Street. The sign shall be posted by the Subdivider.
f. Street lights are to be paid for or installed by the developer at the time of
development. Street lights shall be approved by the Planning director and/or
his/her authorized agent and the Electrical Superintendent. Pole height shall
be no more than 15 feet from finished grade. The type and style of lights and
poles will be determined and agreed upon by the developer and the utility
provider. All other approvals, including the design layout of street lights,
will be granted by the electrical superintendent.
The utility provider shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of
the street lights. Outside the City of Fairhope, the homeowners association will
be responsible for the maintenance, if applicable, and energy costs of the lights
and this responsibility shall be noted on the plat.
4. Block Design -
a. Block Sizes - The perimeter of any block shall not exceed 1,980 feet, except
as authorized in Article V., Section D.7, Exceptions to Street Standards. This
distance shall be measured using the centerline of all streets forming the
perimeter of the block, not including lanes.
b. Block Length  Block lengths shall not be shorter than 220 feet or longer than
660 feet, except as authorized in Article V., Section D.7., Exception to Street
Standards.
c. Block Layout  Blocks shall provide two tiers of lots fronting on a public
street. Double frontage lots are prohibited, except in the case where a lot
consists of more than 66% of the block.
d. Nonresidential Blocks - Blocks used for non-residential purposes, including
mixed-use village centers, commercial, retail, or office, shall not be longer
than 440 feet and the perimeter shall not exceed 1,540 feet.
Commentary
Shorter blocks promote pedestrian activity by making connections between multiple points more
convenient. Residential blocks will be no greater than 660 x 330, or approximately 5 acres.
Subdivisions with uses attracting vehicle trips from outside the neighborhood, and generating
pedestrian trips from within the neighborhood, such as commercial, office or mixed use villages, shall
have a shorter maximum block standard. These blocks will be no larger than 440 x 330, or
approximately 3.3 acres. Pedestrian trips that generate either from adjacent neighborhoods or from
on- or off-street parking will be encouraged by shorter blocks. This will facilitate more efficient use of
the public streets and private property. Exceptions to these standards are specified in Article V.,
Section D.7.
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 41
5. Street Design  All streets shall be designed to support
the adjacent land uses and include features as specified
in Table 5.3 in Appendix A. In addition to the
standards and features specified in Table 5.3, streets
shall meet the following design standards.
a. Generally -
(1) All streets, including lanes, shall have end
points at two separate streets. Cul-de-sacs
and loop streets with endpoints on the
same street are prohibited, except as
provided in section Article V., Section
D.7.a.
(2) L-shaped streets, with end points at two
non-parallel streets, shall not exceed 1000
feet between points of
intersection with other
streets, provided that all
blocks in the subdivision
comply with the maximum
block size. << Figure 5.4 >>
(3) Street Names  Proposed
streets in alignment with
existing, named streets shall
have the name of the existing
street. In no case shall
duplicate or similar sounding
street names be approved,
irrespective of the prefix or
suffix used. Naming shall be
consistent with the general
direction of the street.
Streets running east and west shall be called Avenues and streets running
north and south shall be called Streets.
(4) Half Streets  Where a dedicated half street or half lane is adjacent to the
proposed subdivision, the other half of the street or lane shall be
dedicated with the subdivision. No new half streets or lanes shall be
platted.
(5) Private Streets and Reserve Strips  Private streets and reserve strips for
controlling access to streets, lanes, or utilities are prohibited. All streets
shall meet the standards of this section and be dedicated and open to the
public.
(6) All streets, except lanes, shall provide a curb and gutter meeting City
standards on both sides of the streets
(7) All medians on arterial boulevard or arterial parkway streets shall be
separated from the street by a curb and gutter meeting City standards and
shall be covered with vegetation, except that any portion of the median
may be used for turn lanes at intersections with other streets or for
pedestrian crossings at intersections or mid-block.
(8) Street trees shall be planted on center in all planting strips according to
the following:
Commentary
Streets should be designed to accommodate and
balance the needs of several shared uses, including
pedestrians, bicycles, parking, and vehicle movement.
To accomplish this streets shall include the features
specified in Table 5.3. Transitional streets will
emphasize different features of the street design within
the right-of-way, according to the adjacent land use.
For example, an arterial street may transition with the
following features along its length: a diagonal
parking lane, vehicle lanes, and a large sidewalk
along a commercial block; the parking lane may
become a dedicated turn lane or a bulb-out for
pedestrians and landscape elements at intersections;
and the street lanes or sidewalk could narrow, the
parking lanes could change to parallel, and a planting
strip can be added or expanded on residential blocks.

FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 42
(a) All trees shall be at least 15 gallons and/or 1.5 to 2.5 in diameter
when planted;
(b) Trees shall be planted at least every 25 feet from intersections. A
tree shall be planted one per lot or at least every 50 feet, but no
closer than 10 feet;
(c) Tree species and tree placement shall be approved by the City
Horticulturist;
(d) All trees shall be pruned so that no foliage, limbs or other
obstructions exist between 2½ and 10 feet from the adjacent street
grade;
(e) In areas where planting strips are optional and not provided,
sidewalks ten feet or greater shall provide 4 x 4 tree wells along the
curb so that trees may be planted in conformance with these
requirements.
(9) An inventory of all live trees greater than 24 DBH on site shall be
protected and indicated on a tree preservation plan. Said preservation
plan shall reflect tree protection in the diagram in Appendix G and
verbage below.
Erecting Barriers is essential to protecting trees during construction. The
applicant shall provide construction fences around all significant trees.
Allow one foot of space from the trunk for each inch of trunk diameter.
The intent is not merely to protect the above ground portion of the trees,
but also the root systems. The fenced area shall be clear of building
materials, waste, and excess soil. No digging, trenching or other soil
disturbance shall be allowed in the fenced area.
Fines for not complying with the City of Fairhopes ordinance 1193, tree
protection, will be levied in accordance to the City of Fairhopes
restitution table.
(10) Developer shall be responsible for watering trees prior to subdivision
acceptance and during the 2-year maintenance bond period.
(11) Tree Protection Requirements: The following requirements apply to all
properties other than single-family residences:
(a) A significant tree is defined as any living tree (overstory or
understory) with a DBH that exceeds twenty-four (24) inches.
Significant trees are protected under this Ordinance and cannot be cut
or intentionally harmed without expressed written consent of the City
Horticulturist.
(b) Any person wishing to remove or relocate a significant tree shall,
under the provisions of this section, make written application with the
City Horticulturist. The application shall include a landscape plan (as
defined above). The City Horticulturist must approve or deny the
permit within fourteen (14) working days after receipt of the
application.
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 43
(c) All tree removal will be at the property owners expense except for; 1)
trees on the City right-of-way which are diseased, injured, in danger
of falling close to existing structures, or which create unsafe vision
clearance, the removal of which shall be funded by the City; or 2)
trees beneath utility lines which threaten to damage the utility line, the
removal of which is the duty of the utility company.
(d) Criteria for Issuance of a Tree Removal Permit:
(1) The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement
will be placed according to an approved plan.
(2) The tree is diseased, injured, in danger of falling too close to an
existing or proposed structure(s), interferes with existing utility
service, creates unsafe vision clearance or conflicts with other
ordinance or regulations.
(3) The tree is, or will be after construction, in violation of federal,
state, or local laws, including but not limited to, laws and
regulations pertaining to government programs for financing the
construction.
(4) A permit may be denied if the tree is considered an asset to the
natural heritage of the City of Fairhope and/or the Fairhope Tree
Committee determines that reasonable alternatives to cutting the
tree exist.
(12)No structures, other mail boxes are allowed in the
right-of-way in front of lots used for residential purposes.
Mailboxes shall be allowed subject to the following:
(a) one community mailbox per block; or
(b) one pole-mounted individual mailbox for
lots
with a minimum lot frontage of 75 feet;
or
(c) one masonry-mounted mailbox for lots
with a minimum lot frontage of 100 feet;
(d) lots less than 75 feet in width may have
one masonry or one pole-mounted
mailbox for every two lots.
b. Intersections 
(1) Streets shall be laid out to intersect at right
angles insofar as practicable, but no street
shall intersect with another street at an angle
of less than sixty degrees.
(2) Intersections of three or more streets are
prohibited except in the case of local streets
where three separate local streets may
intersect provided that only two streets
continue through the intersection. << Figure
5.5 >>
(3) Where there is an off-set in the alignment of
a street across an intersection, the off-set of
the centerlines shall not be less than onehundred
and twenty-five feet.

Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 44
(4) Curb radii at street intersections
shall be:
(a) 5 to 15 feet for the
intersection of two local
streets;
(b) 10 to 15 feet for the
intersection of a local street
with a collector street;
(c) 10 to 20 feet for the
intersection of two collector
streets;
(d) 15 to 20 feet for the
intersection of a local street
and an arterial street;
(e) 20 to 30 feet for the
intersection of a collector
street and an arterial street;
and
(f) 25 to 30 feet for the
intersection of two arterial
streets.
Where the angle of intersection
exceeds seventy-five degrees, or where truck traffic and other large
vehicles will make frequent turning movements, the Commission may
require a greater radius.
(5) Proper lines of sight shall be maintained at all intersections. Traffic on
lower class streets shall stop or yield at intersections with equal or
higher-class streets. The proper line of sight shall be an unobstructed
view of from the stopping point to all points three feet above the
roadway along the centerline of the existing street. The distance of the
unobstructed view shall be based on the design speed of the intersecting
street as specified in Table 5.4. No building or other type of visual
obstruction shall be placed, erected or maintained within such triangle.
Street trees are allowed within the sight
triangle, provided that they do not have any
foliage, limbs or other obstructions between
2 and 7 feet, and are not closer than thirty
feet to the intersecting right-of-way line. <<

45 325-400
Commentary
Large curb radii more easily accommodate
right turns for vehicles, but at the expense of
pedestrians due to increased vehicle turning
speeds and greater pedestrian crossing
distances. The curb radius standards balance
these two competing concerns with respect to
normal-sized vehicles and normal traffic
patterns. Intersections used infrequently by
large vehicles normally accommodate turning
movements by allowing the large vehicle to
momentarily swing over the center line, while
any oncoming traffic yields. In the case of
intersections where frequent traffic by larger
vehicles is expected, larger radii may be
necessary. In addition, closer to intersections
on street parking is typically prohibited. At
these locations, bump-outs in the curb can
allow for shorter pedestrian crossings while
still allowing curb radii which accommodate
turning movements.

FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 45
c. Traffic Calming  To maintain design speeds
specified in Table 5.3 (in Appendix A) and the
function of streets specified in Table 5.2., traffic
calming devices may be introduced into the street
design. All traffic calming devices shall be based on
sound engineering principles and are subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission. Traffic
calming devices may include, but are not limited to:
(1) Traffic circles  A circular raised island centered
in the intersection, around which traffic
circulates. Traffic circles require no geometric
changes to the intersection and merely alter the
flow of traffic through the intersection. << Figure
5.7 >>
(2) Roundabouts  A circular raised island centered
in the intersection. Roundabouts require traffic
to circulate counterclockwise around a center
island. Unlike traffic circles, roundabouts require
geometric alterations to the intersection and are
used on higher volume streets to allocate rightsof-
way among competing movements. << Figure
5.8 >>
(3) Curb projections, neck downs or bulb-outs 
curb extensions placed at mid-block locations or
at intersections which narrow the street to
provide visual distinction and to reduce
pedestrian crossing
distances. These
are often used in
conjunction with on street
parking to define the onstreet
parallel parking
areas. << Figure 5.9 >>
(4) Medians  raised islands
located along the
centerline of a street that
narrow the street at that
location or block through
movement of vehicles at a
cross streets or driveway
access points. << Figure
5.10 >>
(5) Road striping  painted stripes on the
road can create the perception of narrow
through lanes when a greater width is
actually needed to accommodate truck
traffic or turning movements.

Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 46
(6) Speed humps - Speed humps are rounded raised areas placed across the road.
<< Figure 5.11 >>
(7) Speed tables  flat topped speed humps
often constructed with brick or other
textured materials on the flat section. <<
Figure 5.12>>
(8) Chicanes - curb extensions or islands that
alternate from one side of the street to the
other, forcing traffic into S-shaped
curves. << Figure 5.13>>
(9) Chokers  curb extensions on both sides of the street that narrow the
street at that location. Chokers may be used in conjunction with onstreet
parking or a mid-block pedestrian crossing. << Figure 5.14>>
d. Geometric Design- the geometric design aspects of the streets shall meet the
minimum standards as provided in the AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Street."
1) Horizontal Curves - Where a deflection angle occurs in alignment of a
street, a horizontal curve shall be introduced and where the magnitude of
such angle exceeds ten degrees, a curve of reasonably long radius shall
be required as specified in the AASHTO Manual, to meet the design
speed in Table 5.3.
2) Vertical Curves - Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical
curve so constructed as to provide a minimum sight distance of two
hundred feet, measured from a driver's eyes which are assumed to be
four and one-half feet above the pavement surface, to an object four
inches high on the pavement. Profiles of all streets showing existing and
finish grades shall be provided and shall be to scale as required by
Article IV, Section C.1.
3) Tangents - Where design speeds are such as to require super elevation of
roadways in horizontal curves, a tangent not less than one hundred feet
long shall be required between reverse curves on all such streets.
4) Grades - Except in cases of exceptional topography, and then subject to
the approval of the Planning Commission, grades shall not be greater
than seven percent or less than one-half percent. Maximum design grades
Figure 5.12  speed table
Figure 5.13 - chicane Figure 5.14 - choker
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 47
should not exceed four percent for arterial streets, six percent for
collector streets or seven percent for other streets. Grades approaching
intersections shall not be greater than five percent for a distance not less
than one hundred feet from the center point of the intersection to the
point of intersection of the vertical curve leading to the subsequent grade.
6. Pedestrian Area Design Standards  All streets shall include a pedestrian area
comprised of a planting strip and a sidewalk, according to the standards in Table
5.3 in Appendix A.
The developer may have the flexibility to construct the sidewalks within 2 years
of final plat approval. A letter of credit guaranteeing the construction for 125%
of the engineers estimate is required. At the end of 2 years, all sidewalks shall
be completed by either the developer or City, using the letter of credit.
The areas in which the sidewalks will be poured shall be graded and compacted
at the time the subdivision infrastructure is constructed.
The pedestrian area shall be designed according to the following minimum
standards:
a. All streets supporting residential land uses shall have a minimum 5-foot wide
sidewalk on each side of the street with the back edge of the sidewalk being
the edge of the right-of-way.
b. All streets supporting public institutions and public facilities land uses shall
include a minimum 5-foot wide sidewalk and 8-foot wide planting strip on
each side of the street.
c. All streets supporting non-residential land uses including commercial, office,
and mixed-use villages, shall have:
(1) a minimum 15 wide sidewalk,
with tree wells according to
Article V., Section D.5.a.8.(e) on
each side of the street; or
(2) a minimum 10 wide sidewalk
and minimum 6-foot wide
planting strip on each side of the
street.
d. Sidewalks shall include curb ramps
meeting accessibility requirements of
the Americans with Disabilities act at
all intersections and any non-grade
driveway or land intersecting the
sidewalk.
e. Sidewalks shall be constructed of a
minimum 4 concrete surface
meeting City construction standards.
Where applicable, sidewalk materials
shall be used and constructed to
encourage maximum tree
preservation.
f. Streets in rural and agricultural
subdivisions meeting all
Figure 5.15  Street layout exception due to natural,
topographical, or environmental features causing
interruptions in the street network. The exception to the
street standard still maintains the street connections and
maximum block limits.
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 48
requirements of Article V., Section D.7.c. and d. are not required to provide
sidewalks.
g. Where applicable, sidewalks shall be configured in a manner that provides
for maximum tree preservation.
7. Exceptions to Street Standards  Subdivisions may be approved with exceptions
to the standards of Article V., Section D. according to the criteria in this section,
at the Planning Commissions discretion. Any plat approved with exceptions
may include conditions to assure that the purposes stated in section D.1. are
achieved.
a. Natural Features  Blocks abutting natural or topographical features may be
approved with exceptions to the blocks and street layout standards of Article
V., Section D., subject to all of the following:
(1) construction of the grid according to the block and street layout standards
must be impracticable in that the applicant would incur substantial and
unreasonable additional costs in designing streets across the natural or
topographical feature or modification of the grid is necessary to preserve
important environmental features such as streams, wetlands, animal
habitats, or other conservation areas; << Figure 5.15>>
(2) Modification of the grid shall not alter the minimum block length or
block size, except that the distance of the property line along the natural
or topographical feature creating the need for the exception shall be
omitted when calculating the perimeter of the block. Additionally,
public access easements to any natural or topographical features which
can be used for active recreation may be used as the perimeter of a block;
and
(3) Cul-de-sacs or loop streets may be approved where connections with a
through street would intersect with the natural or topographical feature.
Loop streets are preferred to cul-de-sacs wherever practicable. Culde-
sacs shall not exceed 660 feet and loop streets shall not exceed 1300
feet.
b. Public Facilities and Institutions - Blocks used wholly or partially for public
facilities and institutions such as schools, churches, hospitals or community
centers, and blocks used partially for public parks or public open space, may
be approved with exceptions to the blocks and street layout standards of
Article V., Section D., subject to all of the following:
(1) Local streets shall be provided at least every 990 feet.
(2) No block perimeter shall exceed 3960 feet.
(3) At least 66% of the land area of any block exercising this exception shall
be used for the public park, open space or public institution.
(3) Blocks used wholly for public parks or open space shall have no maximum size.
Commentary
Platting of streets determines the division of land ownership on a large scale, and from this large scale smaller
divisions and lots evolve. While the smaller divisions and lots will change over time - in ownership, size, and
character  larger divisions effected by the platting of streets will seldom change. (See Traditional Neighborhood
Development Street Design Guidelines, Institute of Transportation Engineers, October 1999, p. 20.) Large lot or
rural subdivisions must still maintain the ability for streets to be platted in conformance with these regulations in the
event that the ownership, character, and size of the smaller divisions and lots changes over time. Any future resubdivision
and street opening under the operation of this section will only be at the landowners initiation. Sections
D.7.c and d. provide exceptions to these subdivision standards while maintaining the opportunity for future resubdivision
in accordance with the standards
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 49
c. Rural subdivisions  Subdivisions of tracts into large lots, which at some future time
could potentially be re-subdivided, shall only be allowed according to this section. The
Planning Commission may require that the blocks and lots shall be of a size and shape,
and contain building site restrictions, to allow for future extension and opening of streets
in conformance with these regulations upon subsequent division of each parcel into lots
of smaller size. Subdivisions consisting entirely of large lots may be considered as rural
subdivisions and may be approved with exceptions to the blocks and street layout
standards in Article V., Section D., subject to all of the following: << Figure 5.16 >>
(1) The subdivision must be
entirely outside of the city
limits;
(2) The total area of the
subdivision must be greater
than 20 acres;
(3) The traffic generated by the
uses proposed in the
subdivision shall not require
any road improvements above
the rural Local Road standard
established in Table 5.3 in
Appendix A;
(4) All right-of-way for streets
shall be reserved on the plat
for future street construction.
Reserved streets shall be in
conformance with the
standards of this subsection
D. The reservation shall
state that any future street
construction under operation
of this section shall only
occur upon the resubdivision
of lots, and upon
the landowners initiative.
No streets need to be
constructed, or
improvements made within
this reserved right-of-way
upon the initial rural
subdivision.
(5) All lots within the
subdivision shall be a
minimum of 5 acres. Lot
lines should follow the
centerline of the right-ofway
platted for future
streets wherever possible.
(6) All buildings constructed
shall be oriented towards
an existing street or the
Figure 5.16  Rural subdivision exception shows larger rural lots,
not meeting the block or street standards of Article V., Section D.
Rural exception is allowed provided the property could eventually
be re-platted in conformance with these regulations without
altering the proposed current street and building pattern. Rural lot
lines (darker lines) follow potential future streets or lot lines
(lighter lines) which are in conformance with block and street
standards Article V., Section D., in the event the property is ever
to be re-subdivided into smaller lots.
Figure 5.17  Building placement on rural lots (darker lines), such
that any potential re-subdivision of the property would not be
limited by proposed current building placement, or require the
future demolition of buildings to be constructed in the proposed
rural plat. In this example buildings are placed on rural lots such
that they can remain on larger corner or mid-block lots of potential
future re-subdivision (lighter lines).
Article V Section D.
Planning Design Standards Street Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 50
reserved right-of-way, so that re-subdivision can occur creating lots in
conformance with these regulations. Buildings shall be placed so that future resubdivision
and the construction of streets on the reserved rights-of-way will not
produce any double-frontage lots or require destruction of buildings. Buildings
placement and orientation options include:
(a) Placement at and orientation towards the end of a block created by existing
streets and reserved right-of-way;
(b) Placement at the corner of a block created by existing streets and reserved
right-of-way. The building should be placed close enough to the corner of
the block so that any future re-subdivision of the lot could create a buildable
lot on the adjacent corner of the block; or << Figure 5.17 >>
(c) Placement at the middle of a block created by existing streets and reserved
right-of-way. The building should be placed close enough to the existing
street or reserved right-of-way so that any future re-subdivision of the lot
could create a buildable lot on the opposite side of the block. << Figure
5.17>>
(7) Lot access may be by a
common driveway with
access to an existing public
street. All lots do not have to
front existing public streets.
Common driveways shall not
exceed 660 feet in length. No
more than four lots or
dwelling units may be
accessed by a single common
driveway. Common
driveways should follow the
centerline of the reserved
right-of-way wherever
possible. No partial public
street improvements shall be
constructed or accepted to
shorten the access by common
drive or increase the number
of access points to the public
street. << Figure 5.18 >>
(8) Any re-subdivision of the lots not in conformance with these standards for rural
subdivisions shall require all streets and blocks to be laid out and improved in
conformance with the standards Article V., Section D.
d. Agricultural Subdivisions  Agricultural Subdivisions do not need to follow any of the
block or street standards provided that all lots created shall be a minimum of 20 acres, are
used for agricultural purposes, and that no public street or utility improvements are
required.

Planning Design Standards Lot Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 51
E. LOT STANDARDS:
1. Purpose - These lot standards shall implement the Comprehensive Plan for the physical
development of the City by establishing lots to promote good civic design and
arrangement. This design and arrangement shall include the avoidance of congestion of
population, the adequate provision of light and air, and the location, character, extent, and
adequate provision of public utilities.
These standards shall promote the following goals in the Comprehensive Plan: (a)
provide pleasant, diverse pedestrian experience; (b) ensure that village centers have
identifiable centers and edges, and ensure pedestrian accessibility; (c) encourage
development that supports the scale and character of existing neighborhoods; (d) provide
public gathering places; (e) provide compact, walkable neighborhoods; (f) encourage
developments with mixtures of housing types, densities, and land uses; and (g) allow
buildings that that relate to public streets both functionally and visibly, and a building
orientation the respects the orientation of surrounding buildings, pedestrian ways and
sidewalks, and surrounding streets.
2. Lot Sizes -
a. Land Subject to Zoning - Where land is subject to zoning all lots shall fully
conform to the requirements of the applicable zoning ordinance. The
applicant shall furnish to the commission site drawings to demonstrate
compliance. Lots not in compliance shall not have building permits issued
unless combined with other lots and reconfigured so as to comply with
zoning requirements.
b. Land not Subject to Zoning -
1) Lots not subject to zoning shall have lot areas
of not less than 15,000 square feet and a
minimum lot width of 100 feet;
2) Where neither public water nor public
sewage is available, lot areas and widths shall
conform to the requirements of the public
health authorities, but in no case shall be less
than 100 feet in width and 20,000 square feet
in area.
c. Insofar as is practicable, side lot lines shall be at
right angles or shall be radial to street lines.
d. Corner lots for residential use shall be designed
with additional frontage, greater than is required
for interior lot widths. The additional frontage
shall be equal to the difference of the minimum
front setback and minimum side setback
requirements for any applicable zoning district,
for the purpose of allowing building orientation
and setback from both front and side streets.
3. Lot Access 
a. Except as provided in Section D.6., all lots shall
Figure 5.19  Minimum curb cut separation
measured from the center of curb cut to
center of curb cut, or from center of curb cut
to right-of-way line of intersecting street.
Article V Section E.
Planning Design Standards Lot Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 52
front upon a paved, publicly maintained street. Double frontage lots are
prohibited, except where lots consist of more than 66% of a block.
b. Curb Cuts and Lanes  Lanes may be required along the rear of lots where,
in the opinion of the Commission such lanes are necessary or where greater
access than that allowed by curb cuts is desired. Curb cuts for driveway
access to lots shall be limited to the following minimum separation distances,
measured from the centerline of each driveway or from the centerline of the
driveway to the right-of-way line of an intersecting street: << Figure 5.19>>
(1) Arterial Streets - 220 feet
between driveways or lanes,
and 150 feet between
driveways and the right-ofway
of an intersecting
street.
However, at least one curb
cut per block shall always
be allowed for a mid-block
lane. Access to lots on
arterial streets shall
primarily be provided by
side streets or lanes.
(2) Collector Streets - 110 feet
between driveways or lanes,
and 100 feet between
driveways and the right-of-way of an intersecting street.
(3) Local Streets  no minimum distance is required between curb cuts on
local streets. However, to enhance the pedestrian environment by
minimizing curb cuts, access to residential lots by lanes or shared
driveways is encouraged.
(4) Lanes  lot access points on lanes shall have no limit or minimum
separation.
c. Driveway Access Widths  driveway access widths shall not exceed the
following widths:
(1) Arterial streets serving nonresidential
lots- 40 feet at the curb
cut and 30 feet at the intersection
with the sidewalk.
(2) Collector streets serving nonresidential
lots- 30 feet at the curb
cut and 20 feet at the intersection
with the sidewalk.
(3) Lanes serving non-residential lots 
25 feet
(4) There is no maximum width for
driveway access on streets serving
residential lots.
d. Driveway and Lane Intersections - The
Commentary
Curb cuts to access lots introduce conflicts to
pedestrians and the traffic flow on streets. While
arterial streets should provide access to property
either by on-street parking or shared lot access, these
conflicts should be minimized. In these cases, rear
lanes are encouraged and may provide additional
access. These standards will result in a maximum of
2 curb cuts on an arterial street with a standard
maximum block of 660; 1 curb cut on arterial streets
with block lengths shorter than 560; 5 curb cuts on
collector streets with a standard maximum block
length of 660; 2 curb cuts on collector streets with
maximum half blocks of 330. Curb cuts on local
streets are not limited, but lanes are still encouraged.

Article V Section E.
Planning Design Standards Lot Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 53
lane or driveway material shall not cross pedestrian sidewalks. << Figure
5.20>>
(1) On conventional driveways or lanes, where vehicles cross at grade with
the pedestrian sidewalk, the sidewalk surface, material and grade shall
continue across the driveway or lane.
(2) On intersection-type driveways, where vehicles access the lot at grade
with the street, the pedestrian sidewalk material, or other material that
differs from the driveway surface in both texture and color, shall
continue across driveway surface.
e. Required Access to Proposed Subdivisions - Except as provided in Article V.,
Section D.6.c. and d., no subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be
subdivided shall have frontage upon and access from an existing publicly
maintained paved street.
4. Building Areas -
a. Building Setback Line - The minimum
setback from the property lines shall be as
specified in the Zoning Ordinance, where
applicable.
b. Each lot shall contain a building lot which is
not subject to flooding and meet all
requirements of City Ordinance number 664,
and any subsequent amendments.
c. Lot size, width, arrangement, and orientation
shall ensure that each lot contains a buildable
area, consistent with all applicable zoning
requirements, and any other applicable City,
County, State or Federal regulation.
d. Where a parcel of land proposed to be
subdivided contains an area of wetlands
delineated as jurisdictional by the Army
Corps of Engineers, said area shall be subject
to Section 404 (b) (1) guidelines concerning
fill material into wetlands. Lots may be
platted where sufficient upland areas exist to
provide a building area for the principal structure and necessary accessory
structures. Fill may be used where necessary to provide access to lots where
approval for fill has been granted by the Corps of Engineers and any other
applicable government agency.
5. Utility Access and Easements -
a. Except where lanes are provided at the rear of lots, easements not less than
fifteen feet in width along side and rear lot lines as required for drainage and
utilities. On interior lots, the easement may be designed to lie equally on
adjacent lots. On perimeter lots, no part of the required easement shall lie
outside the platted lands. Easement placement and widths shall be approved
by the Planning Commission. No half easements will be approved unless
adjacent property owners dedicate the other half of the easement at time of
approval.
Commentary
The purpose of these regulations is to
implement the Comprehensive Plan
and provide integration of all land
uses, public streets, and other
infrastructure, so that conventional
development methods and techniques
such as separation of uses and
buffering are not necessary. This
requires design elements orienting all
uses to all public streets, and
designing the street to support and
maintain the character of those uses.
This allows the street to become an
important public space supporting a
variety of uses and modes of
transportation. However, in the
event that the requisite level of design
is not possible due to existing land
uses or street design, buffering may
be appropriate.
Article V Section E.
Planning Design Standards Lot Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 54
b. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, natural
channel or stream, there shall be provided an easement conforming
substantially to the limits of such water course plus additional width as
necessary for maintenance and future construction.
c. Lots and easements shall be so arranged as to eliminate unnecessary jogs or
off- sets and to facilitate the use of easements for power distribution,
telephone service, drainage, water and sewage collection services.
6. Buffer Strips: In residential
districts, a buffer strip at least
ten feet in width, and in
addition to the minimum
required lot depth, may be
required by Planning
Commission adjacent to all
existing incompatible uses,
such as railroads, limited
access highways, arterial
streets and
commercial/industrial
developments. Such buffer
shall be a part of the platted
lots, but shall be designated on the face of the plat as an easement by imprinting
on the plat the following: "This strip is reserved for planting of trees or shrubs
by owner; placement of structures hereon is prohibited." << Figure 5.21>>
F. STORM WATER STANDARDS:
1. Purpose  These storm water standards shall implement the Comprehensive Plan for the
physical development of the City by setting the location, character and extent of open
spaces and facilities for waterways and storm water runoff, discharge, retention and
detention. This design and arrangement shall promote the health, safety and general
welfare, and promote safety from inundation and erosion caused by storm water runoff.
These standards shall promote the following goals in the Comprehensive Plan:
(a) plan, provide and maintain efficient and effective infrastructure that promotes
orderly growth and environmentally sound practices to meet the future needs of
the community and to support land use goals; (b) promote a sustainable future
that meets todays needs without compromising the ability of future generations
to meet their needs; and (c) encourage and develop connections between
environmental quality and economic vitality.
2. Liability - The design criteria herein establishes minimum elements of design
which must be implemented with good engineering and good construction
practices. Use of information herein for placement of any structure, for use of
any land, or any design basis shall not constitute a representation, guaranty, or
warranty of any kind by the City of Fairhope or its agents, officers or employees
of the practicability, adequacy or safety of design.
3. Submittal Requirements 

FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 56
proposed plans. The agreement must contain a long-term
maintenance plan prepared by the design engineer for each BMP.
The maintenance plan must include a description of the storm water
conveyance system and its components, inspection priorities,
schematics for each BMP, and inspection schedule for each water
quantity and quality BMP. The O&M Agreement must be recorded
prior to final plans approval. If the final configuration of the storm
water system or BMPs differs from the original design on the

BMPs. The owner is responsible for inspecting the storm water
system and BMPs according to the schedule and submitting reports
to the Planning Director or his authorized representative every five
(5) years to document that inspections have been completed and
necessary maintenance has been performed. The first inspection
report is due December 31 of the third year after construction has
been completed. Inspection reports are then due by December 31 of
every fifth year following submittal of the first report. The Planning
Director or his authorized representative must be notified of any
change in ownership. Failure to file the five year inspection reports
and perform required maintenance activities could result in
enforcement action.
(c) Prior to the full release of the performance bond for any new or

representative certification that the proposed storm water
management system and BMPs for the development are complete
and functional in accordance with the approved plans and shall also
provide as-built drawings for the storm water management systems
and BMPs.
(4) Basic Design Data and calculations including routing calculations in
legible tabulated form and proof of adequacy of volume of retention and
sizing computations for low flow structures.

issuance of NPDES Permit, and permits from any other agency, where
required; and,
(6) Any additional engineering information the City of Fairhope staff deems
necessary to make a decision on subdivisions and other development
where adequacy of drainage is reasonably questioned.
b. Adverse Effects - Where it can be reasonably anticipated that additional
quantity or velocity of runoff from development of a subdivision will
overload existing downstream drainage facilities, approval shall be withheld
until there is submitted to the Commission a plan to mitigate damage to
downstream property which would or might result from the subdivision
under consideration. Downstream drainage structures should be considered
when sizing detention outfall structures, with proof of this submitted to the
Article V Section F.

Commission. The hydraulic elevations resulting from channel detention
shall not adversely affect adjacent properties.
c. Additional Engineering Plans and Calculations -
(1) In every case where new streets are to be constructed, and in cases where
subdivisions provide frontage only upon existing right-of-way and there
exists in the opinion of the Commission the potential for damage from
uncontrolled storm-water runoff, the project engineer shall include in his
plans the design and calculations required for adequate control of stormwater.
(2) For projects not exceeding 200 acres, routing calculations shall be in
legible tabulated form. Proof of adequacy of volume of retention and
sizing computations for low flow structures shall be submitted. For
projects exceeding 200 acres, the engineer shall provide detailed,
documented verification of adequacy of design.
(3) No proposals for under-sizing shall be submitted except with plans and
profiles of the entire undersized downstream area with convincing
evidence that the hydraulic gradients proposed will not adversely affect
existing facilities maintained by the City or County.
(4) A special design drawing shall be submitted for any single drainage
structure of 20 square feet in area, or larger.

(4) The calculations, construction plans, and plat shall have the following
statement: A property owners association (POA) is required to be formed.
The POA is required to maintain any and all storm water facilities and
structures located outside of the publicly accepted right-of-way.
4. Stream Buffers 
a. An undisturbed streamside buffer (buffer) is an area along a shoreline,
wetland, or stream where development and redevelopment is restricted or
prohibited. The primary function of the buffer is to physically protect and
separate a stream, lake, bay, or wetland from future disturbance or
encroachment. Buffers can provide storm water management and sustain the
integrity of stream ecosystems and habitats. Buffers can be applied to new
developments and redevelopment by establishing specific preservation areas
and providing management of the buffers through easements or homeowners
associations. For existing developed areas, an easement is typically required
from adjoining landowners. Waivers in accordance with Article VII may be
requested if the developer or landowner can demonstrate hardship or unique
circumstances that make compliance with the buffer requirement difficult.
b. A buffer layer in the Citys GIS system has been developed to show buffer
limits along streams within the Citys planning jurisdiction. The following
Buffer widths used to develop the buffer layer for streams, are shown in the
following table and are measured from the top of bank as defined in Article
II of these subregulations. Buffer widths for ponds, Mobile Bay,
jurisdictional wetlands as determined by the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management and the Army Corps of Engineers, and any
lakes, ponds, and isolated wetlands are also shown in the table. The buffer
requirement applies to streams beginning at a point where the drainage area
is 100 acres or greater.
Feature Buffer Width (feet)
Fish River 100
Other Watersheds 50
Mobile Bay 50
Wetlands (Jurisdictional and Isolated) 30
Ponds/Lakes/Isolated wetlands 30
c. The buffer applies to all properties except those properties that are an
existing lot of record and/or included on an approved preliminary subdivision
plat (as of appropriate date).
d. Allowable uses in the buffer include: flood control structures; utility
easements as deemed necessary and approved by the Planning Director or his
authorized representative; natural footpaths; greenways, paved roadways;
pedestrian and bikeway crossings perpendicular to the streamside including
approaches, dock and ramp access, and other uses as determined by the
Planning Director or his authorized representative. All buffer disturbances
associated with allowable uses shall be to the minimal extent practicable and
all disturbed areas shall be stabilized as soon as possible.
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 59
e. The vegetated target for the buffer shall be undisturbed natural vegetation.
Any of the allowable uses shall be designed and constructed to minimize
clearing, grading, erosion, and water quality degradation.
f. Land in the buffer shall not be used for principal structures and accessories,
such as swimming pools, patios, etc. All new platted lots shall be designed
to provide sufficient land outside of the buffer to accommodate primary
structures. Buffers should be delineated before streets and lots are laid out to
minimize buffer intrusion and to assure adequate buildable area on each
platted lot. Land within the buffer can serve to meet the minimum lot
requirements.
g. Buffer impacts are inevitable with development. Modification and
mitigation of the buffer width are available to landowners or developers of
newly platted lots or subdivisions where there are exceptional situations or
physical conditions related to the parcel that pose practical difficulty to its
development and restrict the application of the buffer requirements. The
landowner or his designated representative may prepare and submit for
approval a written request and site plan showing the extent of the impact of
the buffer on the proposed project and specify a proposed buffer mitigation
plan. The Planning Director or his authorized representative will review and
render a decision on the buffer encroachment and proposed mitigation within
30 days after receiving the request. In no case shall the reduced width of the
buffer be less than 25 feet. Applicants can appeal the decision of the
Planning Director or his authorized representatives decision to the Planning
Commission.
h. In order to maintain the functional value of the buffer: dead, diseased, or
dying trees that are in danger of falling and causing damage to dwellings or
other structures may be removed at the discretion of the landowner; debris in
the buffer that is a result of storm damage may be removed; and, invasive
plant species may be removed if they are replaced by native species. A
buffer restoration plan must be approved by the Planning Director or his
authorized representative.
i. Stream boundaries including each buffer zone must be clearly delineated on
all grading plans, subdivision plats, site plans and any other development
plans. The outside limit of the buffer must be clearly marked on-site with
permanent signs placed every 100 feet prior to any land disturbing activities.
Stream and buffer limits must also be specified on all surveys and recorded
plats and noted on individual deeds. Buffer requirements must be referenced
in property owners association documents and shall be labeled on the plat.
j. When a landowner or his representative obtain permits from ADEM or the
Army Corps of Engineers that results in impacting the buffer then approved
mitigation of these impacts based on the permit conditions supersede the
applicable components of the buffer requirements in areas covered by the
permit. The buffer requirements for areas not covered by the permit shall be
applicable to the remainder of the proposed development site.
5. Flow Control 
a. Scope of Design - All subdivisions or other developments shall be provided
with adequate storm water drainage facilities. The project engineer shall
provide a design adequate to control storm water peak flows, runoff volume
and velocity in accordance with paragraph 7 of this section. In general, the
project engineer shall use design storm criteria based on the site-specific
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 60
conditions that relate to protection of life and property. Culverts shall
generally accommodate a 25-year storm frequency under arterial roadways;
drainage systems within subdivisions should accommodate a 2 through 25-
year storm frequency; bridges shall accommodate a storm frequency of 50
years. When recommended by the City of Fairhope staff, the Planning
Commission may require a storm frequency design as great as 100 years.
(1) There shall be no storm water pumps.
b. Design Standards and Calculations - The method of determining storm water
runoff, plans, and designs shall be based on principles of good engineering
practice and the following standards:
(1) Calculations shall be based on the Rational Method (Q=cia) for small
basins, up to 100 acres, where:
Q=estimated peak discharge in cubic feet per second
c=coefficient of runoff (from table below)
I=rainfall intensity, inches per hour, for a design storm derived from
the time of concentration
tc = time of concentration in minutes, from figure 4-13 of the
Alabama Department of Transportation of Hydraulic Manual,
attached as Appendix D.
a=drainage area in acres
Recommended values for c may be found in table 4-2 of the
Alabama Department of Transportation Hydraulics Manual, attached
as Appendix E. It is recommended that the intensity, I be obtained
from the Intensity-Duration-Frequency curve for Mobile produced
by the National Weather Service.
(2) When the proposed development lies within a large watershed where
flows from upstream drainage areas are passing through the proposed
development, a rainfall-runoff model such as the Soil Conservation
Service (SCS) technical release 20 (TR-20) should be used to calculate
offsite flow. Flow should calculated using a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall,
the depth of which can be obtained from SCS Technical Release 55 (TR-
55). This flow shall be taken into account when designing detention
outfall structures if the upstream flow passes through the proposed
detention pond. The effects of (and on) upstream and downstream ponds
in the watershed shall be analyzed.
(3) All proposed conduits or channels shall be of sufficient capacity to
accommodate potential runoff from developed area, including the entire
upstream drainage area. The project engineer shall include in his
submittals evidence that he has included in his design the tributary area/s.
If an existing channel runs through a proposed development, the engineer
must consider this flow when designing detention and outfall structures.
(4) In general, inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried
across any intersection, or for a distance of more than 600 feet in the
gutter. When calculations indicate that gutter capacities are at maximum,
catch basins shall be used to intercept the flow at that point.
(5) Open channels and ditches shall be so designed as not to create a traffic
hazard or to cause erosion. The minimum slope for paved ditches shall
be 0.5 percent and for non-paved ditches shall be one percent. Maximum
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 61
design flow velocities shall conform to the current edition of the
Alabama Highway Department Hydraulics Manual.
(6) Cleanout access shall be provided at a maximum spacing of 300 feet for
pipes 24 inches or less in diameter and 400 feet for pipes exceeding 24
inches. Cleanouts shall also be provided at each change in line and grade.
(7) Concrete box culverts shall be designed and constructed according to
requirements of the Alabama department of Transportation Standard
Specifications for Highway Construction, current and the Alabama
Department of Transportation Special Standard Highway Drawings.
c. Site Facilities 
(1) The developer shall be required to carry away, by pipe or open channel,
any spring or surface water existing prior to or as a result of the
subdivision. Adequate provisions shall be made within each subdivision
for drainage facilities required.
(2) Where a public storm water system is available, the developer shall be
required to connect his facilities thereto. If no public outlet exists, the
project engineer shall recommend means to adequately dispose of storm
water runoff.
(3) The storm and sanitary sewer plans shall be made prior to other utility
plans.
(4) The storm water system shall be separate from and independent of any
sanitary sewer system.
d. Conformity with Other Standards - All drainage facilities shall be
constructed in conformity with state specifications and all other state and
federal laws and regulations.
e. Flood Prone Areas 
(1) Low lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or overflowing
shall be included in the drainage and shall not be available for
improvements except as specifically authorized by the Citys flood
control ordinance.
(2) Low areas subject to periodic inundation and areas subject to excessive
erosion shall not be developed or subdivided unless and until the
Planning Commission may establish that: The nature of the land use
proposed would not tend to be damaged appreciably by water; The area
may be filled or improved in such a manner as to prevent periodic
inundation; Minimum floor elevations may be established such as to
prevent damage to buildings or structures; There is adequate provision to
eliminate such flooding.
f. Lands Outside the City - Within the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the
Fairhope Planning Commission, all engineering plans shall be subject to the
more restrictive requirement of these provisions or of Baldwin County's
Storm Water Management Plan. In those areas, the County Engineer's review
shall be completed and his certificate of review shall accompany all plans
submitted to the Commission. The following outline is provided to help
insure that certain critical elements of design are in compliance with the
objectives of design:
(1) Volume of retention for entire project
(2) Tributary (Q) peak runoff to basin
(3) Balanced maximum outflow rate from low flow structure
(4) Ratios of inflow to outflow (differential rates)
(5) Sizing of overflow facilities
Article V Section F.

FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 62
(6) Stability of dikes
(7) Safety features
(8) Maintenance features
6. Erosion Control -
a. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas shall be controlled
to reduce erosion and sediment loss during period of exposure. All land
disturbing activities shall be planned so as to minimize off: site
sedimentation damage.
b. No grading or earth moving operations shall commence until erosion and
sedimentation control measures shall have been implemented.
c. All disturbed areas shall be stabilized as quickly as is practicable with
permanent vegetation and erosion/sediment control measures. The duration
of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a minimum.
d. Detention ponds shall be stabilized by means of grassing, sodding, erosion
control netting, or a combination thereof. Sediment shall be removed from
the pond prior to acceptance, and any disturbed areas shall be regrassed. The
use of red clay as a means of stabilizing detention ponds is prohibited.
e. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be provided protect exposed
high-risk erosion areas during development.
f. When the increase in peak rates and velocity of storm water runoff resulting
from a land disturbing activity is likely to cause damaging accelerated
erosion of the receiving channel, plans shall include measures to control
velocity and rate of release so as to minimize damage to the channel.
g. No land disturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake, natural
watercourse or adjacent property unless a buffer zone is provided along the
boundary thereof to confine visible siltation and to prevent erosion; provided,
however, that this prohibition shall not prevent such activity undertaken as a
part of the construction of such lake or watercourse channel.
h. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall not exceed that which can be
retained by vegetation cover or other adequate erosion control methods.
Provision shall be made for planting or otherwise protecting slopes within the
shortest possible time from exposure thereof.
i. Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices shall
provide control from the calculated post-development peak runoff. Runoff
rates and computations may be calculated from procedures contained in the
National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices and shall be
based on rainfall data published by the National Weather Service for the area
and/or official local records.
j. Engineer shall provide for permanent protection of on-site or adjacent stream
banks and channels from the erosive effects of increased velocity and volume
of storm-water runoff resulting from land disturbing activities.
k. Erosion and sediment control plans and details shall be based on the
current edition of the Alabama Handbook for Erosion Control,
Sediment Control and Storm water Management on Construction Sites
and Urban Areas. Erosion control plans shall be prepared by a
certified professional in erosion and sediment control such as a Certified
Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC).
7. Detention and Retention Facilities -
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 63
a. The purpose of storm water retention and detention is to protect downstream
properties from increases in flood heights due to development. A
combination of storage and controlled release of storm water shall be
required for road construction, non-residential developments of one acre or
more, multi-family residential developments of one acre or more, and single
family developments of three acres or more. The requirement for a
combination of storage and controlled release of storm water is not required
for minor subdivisions; however, if the Planning Commission deems that the
intensity of the development could cause off-site storm water flow impacts
during or after development, a combination of storage and controlled release
shall be required. (The effective acreage for a project is not limited to a
fractional part of the total concept; even though developed in phases, it is the
total area of the conceptual plans which governs.) Storage and controlled
release facilities may be required on smaller projects if it is determined in the
Planning Commissions discretion that the intensity of the development could
cause off-site storm water flow impacts during or after development. The
retention or detention (whenever detention requirements are addressed by
these regulations, requirements also apply to retention facilities) facilities
must be designed to control peak flow from the outlet of the site such that
post-development flows are equal to or less than pre-developed peak flows
for the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year and 100-year design storms.
However, detaining the discharge from a site can sometimes exacerbate
flooding downstream due to peak flow timing and/or the increased volume of
runoff coming from a site. If detention facilities are indiscriminately placed
in a watershed and changes to the peak flow timing are not considered, the
detention facility may result in an increase of the peak flow downstream.
Another impact of new development is an increase in the total runoff volume
of flow. Thus, even if the peak flow is effectively attenuated, the longer
duration of higher flows due to the increased volume may combine with
downstream storm water conveyance systems to increase downstream peak
flows. Applicant must demonstrate through hydrologic analyses that the
detention facility will not exacerbate flooding downstream.
b. Such facilities shall be owned, operated and maintained by the development entities and
shall not be accepted for inspection and maintenance by the City of Fairhope. The
burden shall be on the developer and his engineer to provide evidence in support of any
proposal to alter or modify the requirement for detention. Storm water runoff from new
development or significant redevelopment must not adversely affect downstream
properties. In determining whether runoff from the new development or significant
redevelopment causes an adverse impact, the following procedures will be used:
(1) Attenuate post-development peak discharges to a level not to exceed the
pre-development discharges for the 2-year through 100-year recurrence
intervals.
(2) Apply the ten percent rule. This rule is based on the premise that at a
point downstream of a development site where the drainage area above
the development is 10 percent or less than the total drainage area at a
point downstream of the development; then impacts related to storm
water runoff from the development are minimal from this point
downstream. This rule recognizes that in addition to controlling the
peak discharge from the outlet of a detention facility, these facilities
change the timing of the entire outflow hydrograph for the stream or
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 64
river in question. Where required, channel routing calculations must
proceed downstream to a confluence point where the drainage area being
analyzed represents ten percent or less of the total drainage area. At this
point, if the effect of the hydrograph routed through the proposed storage
facility on the downstream hydrograph is assessed and shown not to
increase flows in downstream hydrographs, detention can be waived. If
increased flows are found, then backwater calculations and determination
of flood elevations for the areas impacted by increased flows, if any,
must be prepared. Where downstream increases in peak flows or flood
elevations are shown, detention will be required on site to attenuate
storm water runoff from post-development to pre-development rates. In
the event that the City has developed a Comprehensive Plan for the area,
the recommendations within the Comprehensive Plan will establish the
requirements for detention. The City retains the right to require
detention in areas of known flooding when detention will not exacerbate
downstream flooding.
(3) The release rate from any detention facility should approximate that of
the site prior to the proposed development for the 2-year through 100-
year storm events, with emergency overflow capable of handling at least
the 100-year peak discharge except where waived or altered by the
Planning Commission. Design of the detention pond shall be to insure
that detention facilities will survive overtopping occurring for any
reason, including clogging of controlled outlets for the 100 year storm
event. Detention systems must be constructed during the first phase of
major developments to eliminate damage to adjacent properties during
construction. In this regard, the detention systems shall be designed to
function as sediment traps and cleaned out to proper storage volumes
before completion. If deposition of sediment has occurred, detention
systems must be restored to their design dimensions after construction is
complete and certified as part of the as-built submittal.
c. Detention facilities shall be provided with obvious and effective control
structures. Plan view, sections and details of the structure shall be included in
submittals. Sizing of the low flow pipe shall be by inlet control or hydraulic
gradient requirements. Low flow pipe shall be not smaller than eight inches
in diameter, except in parking lot and roof retention where the size shall be
designed for the particular application as approved by the Commission.
d. The overflow opening or spillway shall be designed to accept the total peak
runoff of the improved tributary area. Proper engineering judgment, with 25-
year, 50-year or greater storm frequencies considered, shall be exercised in
secondary routing of discharge greater than the basic design storm for the
protection of downstream properties.
e. Aerators are required for all retention ponds. The Public Works Director
shall approve the specifications for said aerator.
8. Post Development Water Quality Best Management Practices 
a. Storm water quality BMPs for new development and significant
redevelopment are required for projects that disturb three acres or more or
subdivisions with four or more lots. (The effective acreage for a project is
not limited to a fractional part of the total concept; even though developed in
phases, it is the total area of the conceptual plans which governs). The BMPs
must be designed to achieve the goal of removing at least 80% of the average
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 65
annual post-construction total suspended solids (TSS) load. The storm water
quality BMPs will be considered in compliance with this requirement if;
(1) BMPs are sized to capture and treat the water quality treatment volume,
which is defined as the runoff volume resulting from the first 1.8 inches
of rainfall from a site; and,
(2) Appropriate structural storm water BMPs are selected, designed,
constructed, and maintained.
Storm water quality BMPs may be required on smaller projects if it is
determined in the Planning Commissions discretion that the intensity of the
development could cause off-site storm water impacts during or after
development.
b. The storm water quality treatment goal is designed to capture 85% of the
annual storm water runoff. Storm water quality BMPs must be designed to
treat the runoff from the first 1.8 inches of rainfall. Each sites storm water
quality treatment volume is also based on its percent impervious cover. The
treatment standard is the same for all sites unless other secondary pollutant
reduction goals are established by ADEM; for instance, through the
establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The storm water
quality treatment methodology to determine treatment volume is as follows:
A
WQv = P × Rv ×
12
Where:
WQv = water quality treatment volume, acre-feet
P = rainfall for the 85% storm event (1.8 inches)
Rv = runoff coefficient (see below)
A = drainage area in acres
Rv = 0.015 + 0.0092I
I = drainage area impervious cover in percent (50% imperviousness would be 50)
c. This storm water quality treatment goal is designed to give the developer
flexibility in meeting the 80% TSS reduction goal on each site. BMPs may
be selected to meet the storm water quality requirements in numerous ways
through the application of low-impact site design and layout, non-structural
BMPs, and structural BMPs.
d. The City encourages use of low-impact site design practices that reduce the
impact of development on storm water quality and quantity. Low-impact site
design practices are meant to:
(1) Minimize the impervious cover on a site,
(2) Preserve the natural infiltration ability of the site,
(3) Route storm water to micro controls, such as rain barrels, rain gardens, etc. that
treat small portions of site storm water from the site, and,
(4) Minimize long-term BMP maintenance by preserving and using natural features
of the site.
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 66
e. A developer should consider low impact site design practices early in the
design process in an effort to reduce the overall water quality treatment
volume requirement. These practices tie directly into the storm water quality
program, the WQv calculation, and/or the storm water treatment volume.
These practices should only be implemented when not in conflict with other
City regulations.
f. Structural storm water controls, or Best Management Practices (BMPs), are
engineered structures designed to treat storm water or mitigate the impact
from storm water runoff. The following table presents a pre-approved listing
of structural BMP practices. These BMPs have been assigned a TSS
removal capability, based upon existing research, and can be used by
developers to meet the pollutant reduction goal of 80% TSS removal. The
structural BMPs have been divided into two categories:
(1) General application BMPs are assumed to achieve the 80% TSS reduction.
(2) Limited application BMPs which have to be used in combination with other
BMPs to achieve the 80% reduction goal. These BMPs may not be applicable
for certain sites and require frequent intensive maintenance to function properly.

g. The increase in the frequency and duration of bankfull flow conditions in
stream channels due to development is the primary cause of accelerated
streambank erosion and widening and downcutting of stream channels.
Therefore, streambank protection criterion applies to all development sites
for which there is an increase in the natural flows to downstream feeder
streams, channels, ditches, and small streams. On-site or downstream
improvements may be required for streambank protection, easements or
right-of-entry agreements also may need to be obtained.
h. The developer should determine if existing downstream streambank cover is
adequate to convey storm water velocities for post-development conditions.
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 67
This can be accomplished by first obtaining post-developed velocities for the
Streambank Protection 2-year storm event in the downstream conveyance
system. These velocities are then compared to the allowable velocity of the
downstream receiving system. If the downstream system is designed to
handle the increase in velocity as a result of the proposed development, the
developer should provide all supporting calculations and/or documentation to
demonstrate that the downstream storm water conveyance system will not be
compromised as a result of the development.
(1) If the increased velocities are higher than the allowable velocity of the
downstream receiving system, then the developer may choose to
reinforce/stabilize the downstream conveyance system. The proposed
modifications must be designed so that the downstream post-development
velocities for the 2-, 5-, 10-, and 25-year storm events are less than or equal to
either the allowable velocity of the downstream receiving system or the predevelopment
velocities, whichever is higher. The developer must provide
supporting calculations and/or documentation that downstream velocities do not
exceed the allowable range once the downstream modifications are installed.
(2) The developer may use on-site controls to keep downstream post-development
discharges at or below allowable velocity limits. The developer must provide
supporting calculations and/or documentation that the on-site controls will be
designed such that downstream velocities for the three (3) storm events are
within an allowable range once the on-site controls are installed.
(3) Another approach to meet the stream bank protection requirement is to provide
24 hours of extended detention on-site, for post-developed storm water runoff
generated by the 1-year, 24-hour rainfall event (4.5 inches) to protect
downstream channels. The required volume for extended detention is referred to
as the Streambank Protection Volume (SPV). The reduction in the frequency and
duration of bankfull flows through the controlled release provided by extended
detention of the SPV will reduce the bank scour rate and severity.
i. Stormwater BMPs with either a permanent pool of water or that will hold
storm water for an extended period of time can potentially provide mosquitobreeding
habitat. However, if structural BMPs are properly designed,
installed, and maintained, mosquito problems can be minimized. BMPs with
open water (such as storm water ponds) shall require aeration for mosquito
control. The Public Works Director shall approve the specifications for the
aerator.
9. Location and Easements -
a. Drain-ways, whether conduit or open channel, shall be located within the

11. Required Use of Low Impact Development (LID) Techniques -
a. The use of the LID techniques is required and is to be determined from an entire site
development perspective by the engineer of record for the project. The design and
integration of LID techniques shall promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
the community and shall be designed to work in a complimentary fashion with the
drainage plan for the proposed development. The LID techniques are required within
the municipal limits of the City of Fairhope and the planning jurisdiction of the City
of Fairhope based on the rain events experienced in the area, geology, slopes, and
other natural features. The design engineer is encouraged to submit additional LID
based techniques to be utilized in the proposed development.
b. The use of LID techniques is required in any and all proposed developments where
the stormwater regulations apply. The design engineer shall rely on verifiable
professional engineering judgment on which LID techniques to deploy in each
proposed development based on the particular characteristics of the subject property.
The intent of the requirements for the use of LID techniques is that the development
shall implement as many LID techniques as practical and appropriate for the
development. Plans and calculations shall show the efficacy of each LID technique
and include a quantitative analysis of their performance. Plans shall clearly identify
each LID technique on a grading and drainage plan with appropriate details and
cross-references to the drainage calculations.
c. If a project, due to the natural characteristics of the property, cannot successfully
implement any of the LID techniques the applicant may submit a waiver request for
Article V Section F.

consideration. The waiver request shall be submitted at the time of the application
and provide verifiable engineering documentation that LID techniques cannot be
used. The City shall have the right, but not the obligation, to engage such third party
engineers, consultants and other professionals as necessary and appropriate to advise
the City as to whether a particular application complies with and is otherwise in
concert with this subsection 10 (a Third Party Professional). In the event the City
engages a Third Party Professional in connection with a particular application, the
City will forward all application materials to the Third Party Professional along with
a request for a cost estimate from the Third Party Professional for his/her role in the
review of such application. Upon presentation by the Third Party Professional of a
cost estimate to the City, the City shall provide same to the applicant, and the
applicant shall deposit with the City a cash sum equal in amount to the cost estimate
of the Third Party Professional (the Cash Deposit). Upon completion of all work
by the Third Party Professional relative to such application and payment by the City
of all fees and expenses of the Third Party Professional from the Cash Deposit, if any
portion of the Cash Deposit remains, the City shall refund it to the applicant. If the
Cash Deposit is insufficient to pay the fees and costs of the Third Party Professional,
the applicant shall immediately remit to the City such funds as are necessary to make
up any shortfall.
d. The Third Party Professional shall submit a finding report to the City Planning
Department. The City Planning Department shall forward a copy of the finding to
the applicant or the applicants agent. The City Planning Department shall include,
as part of the application materials to the Planning Commission a recommendation
regarding the waiver.
e. The Planning Commission shall consider the waiver, the applicants documentation,
and Third Part Professional finding and City Planning Department recommendation
and make a final determination as to the waiver request.
f. The following LID techniques are available for use by applicants given the particular
circumstances and characteristics of the proposed subdivision:
(1.) Wet Basins: The City finds the potential benefits of wet basins are, among
other items, allowing sedimentation to fall out of stormwater, attenuating
flows, assisting in evapotranspiration, and improving the stormwater quality.
Special design considerations are: groundwater elevations, large surface
areas are encouraged, special attention should be given in pervious soil,
surface area of the basin should take into account nutrient loading from
lawns for example in order to treat and improve stormwater quality to the
maximum extent possible, ensuring that an adequate base flow is provided to
maintain water levels, they are not recommended to be constructed in an inline
facility, utilize low slopes, the use of forbays are recommended,
upstream and downstream areas shall be considered in the design in
accordance with Fairhope standards.
Recommended characteristics are: The approach slopes should be 4:1 or less
around the perimeter, side slopes 3:1 or less (below the water level, beyond
the safety bench), safety bench just below water elevation (4 wide, 6-12
deep), energy is dissipated prior to entering the basin, can be excavated
below the ground surface.
(2.) Rain Gardens: The City finds the potential benefits of rain gardens are,
among other items, small scale flow attenuation, infiltration, limited
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 70
evapotranspiration, allowing sediments to be trapped, and water quality
treatment.
Special design considerations are: Typically smaller areas and drainage
areas are used for rain garden design, special attention should be given in
pervious soils, recommended for use in hydrologic soil groups A and B, not
recommended in high swell soils.
Recommended characteristics are: Small scale and frequent use in drainage
areas, the choice of landscaping materials, soil mix, and other characteristics
are crucial to the success of a rain garden. Rain gardens can be highly visible
and utilized as a visual amenity in a proposed development.
(3.) Permeable Pavement Systems: The City finds the potential benefits of
permeable pavement systems are, among other items, flow attenuation,
infiltration, and filtration of stormwater. There are many products and
strategies that can be utilized and the City is open to the use of varied
products in accordance with manufacture recommendations. Consultation
with the city prior to design of the product to be utilized is suggested.
Special design consideration are: Use in areas with hydrologic soil groups A
and B, special attention should be given in pervious conditions, not
recommended in areas with high swell soils, ground water tables should not
impact the ability of water to infiltrate, the technique works best in low
slopes.
(4.) Sand Filter: The City finds that the potential benefits of sand filters are,
among other items, flow attenuation, infiltration, reducing sedimentation, and
providing filtration of storm water.
Special design considerations are: Best used in small drainage areas, special
attention should be given in pervious soils, recommended use in areas with
soils with good permeability in hydrological soil groups A and B, not
recommended in high swell soils.
(5.) Grass Swales: The City finds that the potential benefits of grass swales are,
among other items, in straining stormwater, providing limited quality
treatments, while providing some moderate flow attenuation.
Special design considerations are: Typically work best in smaller drainage
areas where volumes are reduced, special consideration should be given in
pervious soils, not recommended with high swell soils, should have low
slopes, adjacent areas and layout should be considered in the design.
Suggested characteristics where topography, soils, and slope permit
vegetated open channels and spaces should be considered as a significant or a
primary means of stormwater conveyance.
(6.) Grass Buffers: The City finds that the potential benefits of grass buffers are,
among other items, in straining stormwater, providing limited quality
treatments, while providing some moderate flow attenuation.
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 71
Special design considerations are: Typically work best in smaller drainage
areas where volumes are reduced, special consideration should be given in
pervious soils, not recommended with high swell soils, should have low
slopes, adjacent areas and layout should be considered in the design.
Suggested characteristics where topography, soils, and slope permit
vegetated open channels and spaces should be considered as a significant or a
primary means of stormwater conveyance.
(7.) Constructed wetland channels or wetlands: The City finds that the potential
benefits of constructed wetland channels or wetlands are, among other
items, flow attenuation, buffering of flooding events, evapotranspiration,
sedimentation, and treatment of stormwater quality.
Special design considerations are: Not recommended in high swell soils, low
slope, forebay is recommended, primary benefit of pollutant removal, not
volume reduction, adjacent areas should be considered in the design.
(8.) Step Pool Stormwater Conveyance Structures: The City finds that a step
pool stormwater conveyance structure may attenuate stormwater flows,
provides evapotranspiration, reduce sediment transport, and water quality
treatment.
Special design considerations are: Not recommended in high swell soils.
Adjacent areas should be taken into consideration in order to ensure long
term viability of step pool structures and adjacent erosion.
(9.) In-line stormwater storage: The City finds that in-line storage may provide
for attenuation and limits sedimentation.
Special design considerations are: Designed to be self-cleaning where
possible or suitable clean out access is provided and designed into the
system, designed to surcharge non-sensitive areas with no flooding in
parking lots, structures, or other typically occupied spaces.
(10.) Site design for habitat, wetland, and water body conservation: The City finds
that site design that incorporates the natural features of the property can help
to minimize erosion and reduce stress on natural water conveyance and
attenuation systems by preserving a natural vegetated state of native plants,
water courses, and flood prone areas.
Suggested characteristics are: The technique may be used in conjunction with
the Citys planned unit development or village subdivision processes to
propose alternative street layouts and design so that impervious areas and
other improvements are sited with due regard to the natural elements of the
property.
Special design considerations: To consider adjacent areas in the design since
important natural features that utilize this LID technique often extends past
property lines or the phases of proposed development.
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 72
(11.) Restoration of Habitat or Wetlands and Water Bodies: The city finds that the
restoration of habitat or wetland and water bodies can be productive to
improve the environment by minimizing erosion and reducing stress on
natural water conveyance and attenuation systems by preserving a natural
vegetated state of native plants, water courses, and flood prone areas.
Suggested characteristics are: This technique may be used in conjunction
with the Citys planned unit development or village subdivision processes to
propose alternative street layouts and design so that impervious areas and
other improvements are sited with due regard to the natural elements of the
property. Use only native plants in the development process and take special
consideration to restore portions of the site to predevelopment native
ecological communities, water bodies or wetlands with more than 10% of the
development footprint.
Special design considerations: To consider adjacent areas in the design since
important natural features that utilize this LID technique often extend past
property lines or the phases of proposed development
(12.)Greenways: The City finds that greenways provide for beneficial use of LID
for potentially active and passive recreation opportunities and wildlife
corridors. This technique allows for the creative integration into a
development proposal that is frequently linked with other natural or
recreation systems that extend past the property lines of the proposed
development.
Suggested characteristics: Typically greenways are easier to integrate into a
development proposal on larger acreages. They are frequently utilized as
linear parks and often include sensitive wetland areas, steep slopes, gullies or
other natural land forms, creeks, and unique wildlife habitat for protected
species.
(13.) Restoring Channel Morphology and Natural Function: The City finds that
restoring channel morphology and natural function provides for flow
attenuation, infiltration, and reduces sedimentation.
Special considerations are: Typically works most effectively in larger
development proposals where a substantial linear footage of channel can be
restored. It is important to consider the upstream and downstream current
and future characteristics so conversation of land use in accounted for in the
design.
(14.) Bio-Retention: The City finds that bio-retention provides for flow
attenuation, infiltration, limited evapotranspiration, reduced sedimentation,
and stormwater quality treatment.
Suggested characteristics are: To be used as both a stormwater and aesthetic
feature frequently throughout developments. Special attention should be
given to plant and ground cover considerations given the volume and
duration of the designed stormwater.
Article V Section F.
Planning Design Standards Storm Water Standards
FAIRHOPE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 73
Special design considerations are: Typically work best in small drainage
areas with frequent use and distribution, special attention is required in
pervious soils and should be used in areas with high permeable soils
(hydrologic soils groups A and B), not recommended in high swell soils.
(15.) Level Spreader: The City finds that level spreaders can be an effective tool
to evenly distribute flows and return volumes and velocity to a
predevelopment distribution pattern. There are limited stormwater straining
and water quality improvements.
Suggested characteristics are: Level spreaders are intended to work in a
complimentary fashion with other LID techniques such as, but not limited to,
sand filters and grass buffers.
Special design considerations are: Typically level spreaders are used
downstream of an outfall and have a low slope with stabilized and vegetated
buffers both up and downstream. They typically are installed a suitable
distance from the property line (30-35 is suggested) so that flow energy is
dissipated, and predevelopment sheet flow characteristics are generated.
Special consideration should be given in areas with highly erodible soils.
(16.)Additional information regarding LID techniques is included in the document
Planning For Stormwater, Developing a Low Impact Solution, a publication
of the Alabama Cooperative Extension Service. This document is available
for download from the Alabama Cooperative Extension Service website.
G. UPSIZING:
1. Purpose  These upsizing standards shall implement the Comprehensive Plan for the
physical development of the City by setting the location, character and extent of adequate
public utilities. This design and arrangement shall promote the wise and efficient
expenditure of public funds and establish the extent to which water and sewer and other
utility mains, piping or other facilities shall be installed as condition precedent to the
approval of the plat.
These standards shall promote the following goals in the Comprehensive Plan: (a) define
priority growth areas that will guide the future extension of public infrastructure; (b)
prioritize projects that pay their way through covering the cost of necessary support
services; (c) require that the location and alignment of infrastructure systems are efficient
and cost-effective; and (d) provide for balance between maintenance and reconstruction
of existing streets, services or facilities and expansion into new areas.
2. Applicability  Whenever any portion of the required improvements for the
subdivision is part of planned future facilities for the City serving an area larger
than the subdivision, the Planning Commission may require that the applicant
construct the improvements to the capacity of the City plans. The applicant will
be responsible for that portion of the costs required to serve the proposed
subdivision, and the City shall reimburse the developer for those incremental
costs to expand the improvements to the planned capacity. The Planning
Commission may condition the approval of the preliminary plat on an agreement
Article V Section G.

* An Avenue is a local street but it may be designed using Parkway or Boulevard Standards. It functions linearly as a local street, with a short distance providing little continuity. However, it shall have the design characteristics of a Boulevard or Parkway, and
support access to non-residential uses when the adjacent arterial streets on which those uses are located are unable to perform this function (with regards to vehicle access, pedestrian access, or on-street parking) completely.
1 Parking lanes shall be 7 wide for parallel parking and 18 for angled parking at a 60° angle. Where parking lanes are listed as optional, they may either be dedicated parking lanes, restricted parking lanes which provide through traffic at times and locations where parking is not prohibited
in the Citys discretion, or not provided. When optional parking lanes are not provided, additional ROW width shall be used for either expanded planting strips, sidewalks, or bike lanes.
2 Shared-use or non-striped bike lanes require a 14 shared-use lane measured from the road edge exclusive of the curb and gutter pan; dedicated or striped bike lanes require an 11 vehicle lane plus a 5 striped bike lane including the 1 to 2 curb and gutter pan.
3 Yield flow lanes are lanes where traffic may pass each direction but two-way traffic is impossible when parked vehicles are present, requiring vehicles to yield to oncoming traffic.

and VI of the Zoning Ordinance, all in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
Article III Section A
Zoning Districts Purpose and Intent
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 16
1. R-A Residential/Agriculture District: This district is intended as a rural environment providing primarily
agriculture and agriculture-related uses. Residential uses are allowed at overall low density to support rural and
agriculture lifestyles proximate to the city. This district may also be used as a holding zone for future
development in accordance with the comprehensive plan, when future conditions allow for efficient expansion
of urban services.
2. R-1 Low Density Single-Family Residential District: This district is intended to provide choices of low-density
suburban residential environment consisting of single-family homes on large parcels of land. It is sub-classified
into four categories (R-1, R-1a, R-1b, and R-1c) based on lot sizes.
3. R-2 Medium Density Single-Family Residential District: This district is intended as a medium density singlefamily
urban residential district, with lots of moderate size.
4. R-3 High Density Single-Family Residential District: This district is intended as a high-density single-family
urban residential district with lots of relatively small size as compared to the preceding single-family residential
districts.
5. R-3 PGH High Density Single-Family Patio/Garden Home Residential District: This district is intended to
provide areas that will be limited to single-family development of a patio/garden home nature where only one
(1) side yard is required. The regulations of the R-3 PGH District shall apply to property zoned R-3 PGH as of
July 10, 2000. Development of patio homes after this date shall use the PUD zoning districts.
6. R-3 TH High Density Single-Family Townhouse Residential District: This district is intended to provide areas
exclusively for the development of town houses on a high-density basis where no side yards are required.
7. R-4 Low Density Multi-Family Residential District: This district is intended to provide a medium high density
single-family structure and two to four family units to a building structure.
8. R-5 High Density Dwelling Residential District: This district is intended to provide opportunity, within a
general protected residential environment, for the highest residential district density considered as appropriate to
the environmental character of the city. Within this district it is also considered suitable to include other uses of
a type considered not incompatible with a good high-density living environment and providing for needed
community services.
9. R-6 Mobile Home Park District: This district is intended to provide space at appropriate locations consistent
with community objectives for the establishment of mobile home parks which provide for the establishment of
permanent mobile homes for the amenities conducive to an adequate living environment.
10. B-1 Local Shopping District: This district is intended to provide for limited retail convenience goods and
personal service establishments in residential neighborhoods and to encourage the concentration of these uses in
one (1) location for each residential neighborhood rather than in scattered sites occupied by individual shops
throughout a neighborhood. Restaurants in the B-1 zoning district may be permitted only on appeal to the
Board of Adjustments and may be subject to special conditions. Drive thru restaurants shall not be permitted in
the B-1 zoning district.
11. B-2 General Business District: This district is intended to provide opportunity for activities causing noise and
heavy traffic, not considered compatible in the more restrictive business district. These uses also serve a
regional as well as a local market and require location in proximity to major transportation routes. Recreational
vehicle parks, very light production and processing activities are included.
12. B-3a Tourist Resort Lodging District: This district is intended to provide commercial and resort areas at
appropriate locations to serve the needs of tourists visiting the Bay Beaches and related recreational and cultural
attractions. Commercial activities restricted to restaurants, which are attached to or are an integral part of the
complex are permitted.
Article III Section A
Zoning Districts Purpose and Intent
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 17
13. B-3b Tourist Resort Commercial Service District: This district is intended for a range of commercial and resort
residential uses at appropriate locations to serve the needs of tourists.
14. B-4 Business and Professional District: This district is intended to provide opportunity for business
establishments of a professional nature and is restricted to offices and businesses, which provide specific
corporate functions or professional services to the general public.
15. M-1 Light Industrial District: This district is intended to provide a suitable protected environment for
manufacturing, research and wholesale establishments which are clean, quiet and free of hazardous or
objectionable emissions, and generate little industrial traffic. Industrial parks should be encouraged. Locations
should be in accordance with comprehensive plans.
16. M-2 General Industrial District: This district is intended to provide opportunity for the location of industrial,
manufacturing, processing, warehousing, or research and testing operations that, due to employment of heavy
equipment or machinery or to the nature of the materials and processes employed, require special location and
development safeguards to prevent pollution of the environment by noise, vibration, odors or other factors, and
may also require extensive sites for storage and parking, may require extensive community facilities or generate
heavy motor traffic. Access to major transportation facilities is usually needed. Locations should be in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and special review is required for some.
17. PUD Planned Unit Development: This district is intended to encourage innovative development that meets
comprehensive plan goals and is tailored to the unique constraints and conditions of a particular site. This
district allows flexibility in uses, designs, and building layouts as opposed to other zoning districts to better
serve community needs. See Article V., Section A for more detailed standards regarding this district.
18. CBD Overlay District: This district is intended to preserve downtown Fairhope as the regional village center
and as the focal point of the City, in accordance with the comprehensive plan. The district encourages infill
development, including shopping, restaurant and entertainment, cultural and artistic institutions, offices,
government functions, and residential uses, provided it creates a pedestrian oriented atmosphere and is
consistent with the historic fabric of downtown.
19. Airport Overlay District: This district is intended to preserve the ongoing operation of the Fairhope Municipal
Airport as an economic asset for the community by preventing land uses incompatible with the operations of a
municipal airport.
20. Flood Hazard District: This district is intended to secure life and property from peril and damage of natural
flood hazards, protect property values, and insure compliance with Federal flood insurance eligibility
requirements.
21. Parking District: This district is intended for those situations were parking may be provided more efficiently
and with less impact on goals for the overall surrounding areas by consolidating and sharing parking in one
location.
22. VRM Village Residential Mix: This district is intended to create walkable neighborhoods that place a variety of
residential types within close proximity to open space and village centers that meet the majority of needs for
daily living. This district is developed to more directly implement the neighborhood component of the
Comprehensive Plan. See Article VI, Section A for more detailed standards regarding this district.
23. NVC Neighborhood Village Center: This district is intended to create walkable commercial areas to support
adjacent neighborhoods. This district is developed to more directly implement the Neighborhood Village
Center component of the Comprehensive Plan. See Article VI, Section B. for more detailed standards regarding
this district.
24. CVC Community Village Center: This district is intended to create a community center that serves a broad range
of neighborhoods that may be automobile-oriented but still creates a walkable commercial center accessible by
a variety of modes of transportation. This district is created to more directly implement the Community Village

B. Screening, Lighting and Landscape Material
C. Streetscape
D. Site Access and Internal Circulation
E. Parking
F. Stormwater Management
G. Tree Preservation
This Article provides site design standards for seven key elements that are part of most development sites: open
space; screening, lighting, and landscape material; streetscape; site access and internal circulation; parking;
stormwater management; and signs. The standards are intended to contribute to the ability of development sites to
integrate into the Citys overall plan. The standards and guidelines in this article should be applied in every zoning
district and to every site design to the extent that the component is required by any development regulation or is
otherwise proposed as part of the site plan or development. These design standards should be applied in addition to
any specific area or design standards contained in other sections for a particular zoning district.
A. Open Space
1. Intent
The open space design standards are intended to provide design solutions that ensure each area of open space
serves a specific function and is not merely left over or under-utilized space. The design standards are also
intended to provide greater access to a wider variety of open spaces. These design standards are to be applied to
any area used to meet specific area requirements of the zoning districts and subdivision regulations for open
space or greenspace.
2. Types of Open Space
The following Table 4-1 indicates the categories, types, and general sizes of open space that can be used to meet
the City requirements for open space and greenspace. Generally there are two categories  Natural and Civic.
Natural open space is most appropriate in neighborhoods, rural areas, or at the edges of village developments.
It can also be used at any location where significant natural features warrant preservation. Civic open space is
most appropriate in convenient locations, easily accessible by a large number of people. Typically this will be
at the center of a residential neighborhood or in a village or commercial center.

NATURAL OPEN SPACE
Preserve
An undeveloped area that contains
significant natural features or
habitat worthy of preservation.
Features such as large stands of
trees, water elements, or
prominent topography
characterize preserves. A
preserve may by use for passive
recreation or as a scenic and
visual buffer. It generally
contains little or no constructed
improvements although trails may
access the preserve.
The size of a Preserve
open space should be
based on the site
characteristics and
potential continuity of
natural features in the
area along with the
potential to connect to
adjacent natural areas.
Trail /
Greenway
An undeveloped area of
continuous linear natural features,
often following a stream or
floodplain. A trail or greenway
should be usable for recreation
and non-motorized transportation.
It includes few constructed
improvements except for those to
enhance travel or recreational use.
Generally should
include at least 3 acres
but should be sized and
located based on
providing significant
continuity throughout a
development and to
areas beyond the
development area. Must
be at least 30 wide at
all locations.
Park
An undeveloped natural area for
unstructured recreation. A park
may include some areas for
structured recreation, such as ball
fields, but generally this area
should occupy no more than 25%
of the total area. Parks are located
based on the presence of natural
features or based on convenience
for surrounding residents. A park
has a predominantly natural
landscape although portions may
be designed for aesthetic and
recreation purposes, particularly
for parks located due to
convenience.
At least 3 acres

CIVIC OPEN SPACE
Green
An open space for unstructured
recreation or aesthetic
landscaping. A green is bordered
by public right-of-ways on at least
2 sides, front building facades,
and formal landscaped elements
to define its boundaries.
Generally there are few
constructed elements except as a
formal entry to or a focal point for
the green.
¼ to 3 acres
Plaza
An open space for civic purposes
and commercial activities. A
plaza is bordered by public rightof-
ways on at least 2 sides, and
building facades to define its
boundaries. It is largely
constructed of materials to
withstand heavy pedestrian traffic,
but contains intermittent lawns,
landscape beds, or trees in a
formal pattern.
1/8 to 2 acres
The size of plazas is
generally determined by
the height of
surrounding buildings,
maintaining between a
1:3 and 1:6 ratio of
building height to plaza.
Courtyard
A small open space accessible to
the public but generally serving
one or a few surrounding
buildings. Courtyards are
primarily bordered by building
facades, but have at least one side
fully or partially boarded by a
public right-of-way. Courtyards
are often constructed of materials
to withstand heavy pedestrian
traffic, but contain intermittent
formal landscape elements.
1000 square feet to 1/8
acre
The size of courtyards is
generally determined by
the height of
surrounding buildings,
maintaining a between a
2:1 and 1:3 ratio of
building height to
courtyard.
Playground
Open space designed and
equipped for structured recreation.
Playgrounds are often boarded by
a fence or other private boundary
(as in the case of a playground
internal to a block) but are
accessible by common pedestrian
path. Alternatively, playgrounds
included as part of a larger civic
or natural open space do not
necessarily have borders.
1000 square feet to ¼
acres.
A playground may be
part of larger civic or
natural open space.

with the architectural elements of the buildings on the site.
(2) No corrugated metal sheets, solid sheets of metal, plywood, particleboard, barbed wire, razor
wire, or similar materials shall be allowed.
C. Streetscape
1. Intent
Streetscape refers to the area between building
facades on opposite sides of the street. It
consists of public rights-of-way and private but
publicly visible space. The streetscape site
design standards are intended to create a
smooth transition from the public realm to the
private realm, provide a pleasant pedestrian
experience, improve the appearance and
function of the public rights-of-way, and
reinforce and enhance the perception of the
City as a unique and livable community. See
Figure 4 1.
2. Frontage Types
The following Table 4-2 indicates frontage types that make up the private portion of the streetscape. In
zoning districts where specific setbacks are specified, any frontage type within that range may be used.
In zoning districts where specific frontage types are specified, the frontage types may be used within
the acceptable setbacks listed in this section and in the zoning district standards.
Figure 41. Streetscape refers to all areas visible from the
street and fronting buildings, and may consist of public or
private property.

Table 4-2: Frontage Types
Frontage Building line* Description Image
Yard
20 minimum
40 maximum
Estate dwelling units
and Civic uses with a
yard frontage shall have
no maximum depth for
the front building line.
A frontage with the building set back from the rightof-
way line. The yard area is most appropriately
used for landscape materials, natural vegetation, or
focal points such as art or sculptures. The yard
frontage is most appropriate in rural settings,
residential neighborhoods, for residential uses along
arterial streets where a buffer is desired, and for
civic land uses in any setting.
Terrace
8 minimum
20 maximum
A frontage with the buildings separated from the
right-of-way by a slightly elevated garden or small
yard. The terrace area is most appropriately used
for landscape materials and entry elements, such as
stairways, gateways or small fences or hedges. The
terrace frontage is most appropriate in residential
neighborhoods or areas of steeper topography.
Courtyard
10 minimum
20 maximum
A portion of the
building, typically more
than 50% of the front
façade) should be built
at or near the right-ofway
line
A frontage with a portion of the building close to the
right-of-way line, while the remaining potion is
setback from the right-of-way line, providing a
pocket of open area in the courtyard. The courtyard
area is most appropriately used for landscape
material or constructed patios for pedestrian traffic.
The courtyard frontage is most appropriate on
higher-density residential blocks or for businesses
that can utilize formal outdoor space.
Stoop
8 minimum
15 maximum
A frontage with the building close to the right-ofway
line but with the first floor slightly elevated
(typically 3 to 5 feet) to ensure privacy to occupants
of the building. Typically the closer the building
line is to the right-of-way, the higher the elevation
of the first floor should be. The setback area is most
appropriately used with an ornamental stair and
entranceway to the buildings, potentially with a
small usable space at the top. The remaining
portion of the setback area can include a small area
of landscape material. The stoop frontage is most
appropriate for higher-density residential blocks, or
residential buildings mixed on blocks with nonresidential
buildings.
Street-front
0 minimum
10 maximum A frontage with the building at the right-of-way line
or slightly set back from the right-of-way line. The
ground level of the building is predominantly
transparent and available to uses serving the public,
thus providing varied and interesting environment to
pedestrians. Any setback area is typically designed
seamlessly with the right-of-way with either
expanded sidewalks, landscape beds, street-front
seating, or a covered walkway. The street-front
frontage is most appropriate for non-residential uses
in pedestrian-oriented areas.
* The building line expresses the general acceptable range for distances of principal buildings from the right-of-way.
This range shall apply unless a more specific set back or build to line is specified for a particular zoning district.
Article IV Section C
Site Design Standards Streetscape
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 37
D. Site Access and Internal Circulation
1. Intent
Site access and internal circulation standards are intended to balance the need for site-access by
vehicles with pedestrian movements. Design elements are intended to create a smooth transition from
the public rights-of-way to the private property, and to improve the appearance and function of the
public rights-of-way for all users including pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles.
2. Curb Cuts
Curb cuts for property not being subdivided shall be allowed according to the same Lot Access
standards established in the Fairhope Subdivision Regulations. When the development process
requires access standards different from those standards, either from a traffic study or through a
subdivision waiver process, the revised standards shall comply with the goals of the Comprehensive
Plan, the Subdivision Regulations, and this ordinance. Any special access conditions for particular
uses are indicated in Article III., Section D., and any special access conditions for particular zoning
districts are listed in Article VI.
3. Internal Driveways, Aisles and Driveway Lanes
All driveways shall be set back a minimum distance of three feet from the side lot line, except where
shared access driveways are provided. To the extent practical, all internal driveway aisles should be
designed and dimensioned as closely as possible to the public street standards in the Fairhope
Subdivision Regulations, including sidewalks, planting strips, and parking lanes.
4. Clear sight lines
Clear sight lines shall be maintained for all lot access points and internal circulation intersections in
accordance with the standards for public street intersections specified in the Fairhope Subdivision
Regulations.
5. Off-Street Loading/Unloading
Off-street loading/unloading spaces shall be provided according to the following:
a. Size of Spaces: Each off-street loading/unloading space shall have minimum dimensions of 14 feet
in height, 12 feet in width, and 55 feet in length. However, upon sufficient demonstration that a
particular loading space will be used exclusively by shorter trucks, the board of adjustment may
reduce the minimum length accordingly to as little as 35 feet.
b. Connection to Street or Lane: Each required off-street loading/unloading space shall have direct
access to a street or lane, or have a driveway which offers satisfactory ingress and egress for
trucks.
c. Required spaces: All non-residential buildings with uses requiring the receipt or distribution of
materials or merchandise shall provide at least one off-street loading/unloading space per each
10,000 square feet , or fraction thereof, of floor area located on the same lot as the building or use.
Adjacent buildings or uses of less than 10,000 square feet may share loading/unloading spaces
within 300 feet of the loading/unloading entrance. All off-street loading/unloading spaces shall be
located to not hinder free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street, or lane.
d. Permanent Reservation: Areas reserved for off-street loading/unloading in accordance with the
requirement of this ordinance shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the
Article IV Section D

FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 38
permitted use which is served is discontinued or modified unless alternate and equivalent
loading/unloading space is provided and approved by the board of adjustment.
E. Parking
1. Intent
Parking standards are intended to provide adequate access and vehicle storage for land uses, but also
minimize negative impacts of large expanses of parking such as poor pedestrian environments,
degraded community aesthetics, additional stormwater runoff from excess impervious surfaces, and
under-utilized space.
2. Required Parking
The following Table 4-3 is the parking schedule and represents the minimum required parking spaces
for specific land uses. These standards shall apply in any district the use is allowed, or permitted by
special exception. These standards shall not apply to the CBD Overlay, where on-street parking is
permitted. However, wherever practicable, businesses in the CBD Overlay are encouraged to provide
off-street parking facilities. Any specific use or district condition in Article III of this ordinance shall
apply along with the standards and conditions of this Section. Any area reserved for off-street parking
in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance shall not be reduced in area or changed to any
other use unless the permitted use, which it serves, is discontinued or modified, or alternate and
equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the board of adjustment.

operation.
d. All shared parking shall be located within reasonable proximity of main entrance of the building.
e. Direct pedestrian access to and from the building and the parking area is required.
6. Low Impact Development (LID) Parking Requirements
Landscaping is required for all parking lots. The interior parking lot landscaping requirements shall
use LID techniques and be designed by an Alabama licensed Professional Engineer and an Alabama
licensed Landscape Architect or designer. The following LID techniques shall be used in the interior
of all parking lots containing 12 or more parking spaces. The LID parking requirement landscape plan
will be reviewed in accordance with the Tree Ordinance. Any landscaping plan submitted in
accordance with this subsection shall include technique 5 below and at least one of the other following
techniques:
1) First Flush Treatment: The LID landscaping design shall be sized appropriately to treat the first
one inch of runoff into the receiving parking lot LID area.
2) Bio-retention.
3) Rain Garden.
4) Vegetated Swale.
5) Permeable Pavement Systems: Permeable pavement systems are a required LID technique. 100%
of parking provided over and above the minimum parking requirements shall be permeable
pavement systems. Typical systems are brick pavers, pervious asphalt, and pervious concrete.
Other systems may be approved if the design engineer provides adequate documentation that
demonstrates the proposed technique is equally or more effective that the typical permeable
systems listed. Approval of a proposed technique is at the sole discretion of the City during the
Article IV Section E
Site Design Standards Parking
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 41
permitting process.
6) Tree and Ground Cover Plantings: When trees are required in a parking lot by the Tree Ordinance
they shall be included and integrated into the LID design. Species shall be as approved by the
City Horticulturist and must be suggested by the landscape architect or designer. There shall be
no bare ground exposed and all ground cover proposed shall be integral to the success of LID
techniques. All ground cover shall be as approved by the City Horticulturist and must be
suggested by the landscape architect or designer.
7. Parking Credits
A credit may be given to the requirements of Table 4-3  Parking Schedule, under the following
conditions:

rate of one credit for every two on-street parking spaces.
b. Bicycle parking facilities within reasonable proximity of the main entrance may be credited at a
rate of one credit for every five-bicycle parking spaces, up to a maximum of 10% of the required
vehicle parking.
F. Stormwater Management
1. Intent
The intent of this section is to provide for stormwater management in site design. The primary
management strategy should be infiltration of all runoff created by development through natural
systems and constructed natural systems. Should infiltration not address stormwater management for
the site adequately, retention and detention of run-off will be required. This section also seeks to
incorporate any stormwater management system into the design of the site as a natural or aesthetic
amenity.
2. General Requirements
All site plans shall be designed with surface drainage provisions in accordance with the Fairhope
Subdivision Regulations, construction, building, or grading permits, and any other City ordinance
regarding the effects of stormwater. Developers shall take steps necessary to prevent run-off, which
may have the potential for causing flood damage to neighboring property. The building inspector
shall, in consultation with the city engineer, determine that reasonable provisions for properly handling
surface drainage have been made in the applicants design, and will report these findings for the
Fairhope Planning Commissions consideration in acting on building applications. If reasonable
provisions are not made in the applicants design, the Fairhope Planning Commission shall make the
remedies available to the applicant a condition of the approval, or deny the application. Dry wells,
biofilters, or other constructed infiltration systems may be required of sufficient capacity to receive up
to four inches per hour rainfall on the paved area or areas required for off-street parking and loading.
Rainfall intensity to be calculated on storm frequency determined by the commission and/or its
consultants.
3. Design Standards
Storm water detention shall be screened from direct view from all abutting properties by installation
and maintenance of living plants at least 36 inches in height at time of planting, and achieve a height of
not less than six feet in three years after planting. Outer slopes of detention ponds shall not be steeper
than four feet horizontal to one-foot vertical. Where water depth and time of detention is sufficient to
require safety fencing, such fencing shall be installed behind required screening, on the pond side.
4. Alternative Designs
Article IV Section F
Site Design Standards Stormwater Management
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 42
Standards of this ordinance and any standard of this ordinance that relates to the City of Fairhope
Subdivision Regulations may be waived to provide for an alternative stormwater design system
provided that:
a. The alternative stormwater design provides for an infiltration system that incorporates at least 80%
of the runoff from impervious surfaces into the groundwater on the site and results in an overall
reduction in impacts on streams in the watershed.
b. The alternative stormwater design addresses stormwater on an area-wide or watershed basis
making stormwater management on individual lots within the site unnecessary.
c. Natural elements on the site are incorporated into a natural storm drain infrastructure minimizing
or eliminating the need for detention ponds and other constructed storm drainage. Constructed
elements of the natural drainage system shall be limited to artificial wetlands, bio-filters, and dry
swales. To the extent that it does not damage the function of the natural drainage system, natural
elements should serve additional community purposes such as trails or greenways, parks, or
aesthetic screens.
d. Any waiver of standard to accommodate the alternative stormwater design proposes an equal or
better alternative for meeting the intent of the waived standard.
e. The alternative stormwater design is accompanied by a plan produced by a registered engineer
testifying to its accuracy and sustainability.
f. The alternative stormwater design plan included provisions for long-term maintenance and
operation of the alternative design, including easements, covenants, restrictions, and an acceptable
legal entity to oversee long-term maintenance.
g. The alternative stormwater design plan shall accompany a site plan for the entire development.
The plan and any waivers to the standards of this ordinance shall be approved according to the
procedures and standards for the site plan.
Article IV Section G
Site Design Standards Tree Preservation
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 43
G. Tree Preservation
On a site where a live Heritage Tree exists, the Planning and Building Director may grant up to a seven foot
(7) administrative setback variance in order to protect and/or preserve an existing Heritage Tree as defined
in Article IX, Section C. of this Ordinance.
The only types of Heritage Trees protected under this Ordinance shall include:
Various Oak Trees (Quercus Species), Cedar Trees, Cypress Trees, Magnolia Trees and any other unusual
species identified as a desirable tree by the City Horticulturist.
In an effort to preserve the critical root areas for existing trees on public and private properties, trenching is
not allowed within nine feet (9) of any property line. One may use a directional boring (Horizontal
Directional Drilling  HDD) method of service installation within the 9 no-trenching setback.

Special Districts Medical Overlay District
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 50
E. AO  Airport Overlay
1. Intent and Authority  The Airport overlay promotes the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by
preventing the creation and establishment of land uses incompatible with the operations of the Fairhope
Municipal Airport and requiring the incorporation of outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation measures for the
construction of certain structures within the boundary of the Airport Overlay District Zone. The Airport
Overlay is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Title 4, Chapter 6, Section 1 through 15, Code of
Alabama, 1975.
2. Findings  The City finds that certain land uses are incompatible with noise generated by aircraft using the
Fairhope Municipal Airport and that these land uses have the potential to impair the existing and future utility of
the Fairhope Municipal Airport and the public investment in the Airport. Accordingly, it is declared:
a. That the establishment and construction of noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have
the potential of limiting the existing and future utility of the airport and may adversely affect the region
served by the Fairhope Municipal Airport;
b. That noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have the potential to become land uses
incompatible with airport operations over time and it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public
safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of incompatible land uses be prevented.
c. The prevention of the creation or establishment of incompatible land uses, and the elimination, removal,
alteration, and mitigation of incompatible land uses are public purposes.
d. That land in the vicinity of the airport has the potential of being exposed to sound levels of 65 Ldn and
higher.
e. That the construction of certain noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport should include
outdoor-to-indoor noise attenuation features to ensure compatibility with existing and future noise levels.
f. That the Fairhope Municipal Airport fulfills an essential community purpose.
g. The Airport overlay promotes the implementation of modest measures that will prevent conflicts between
future residential homeowners and the airport that could require expensive retroactive noise insulation
programs, residential relocation programs, and restrictions on the efficient operation of the Fairhope
Municipal Airport.
3. Applicability  The Airport overlay is applicable to all lands lying within the Airport Overlay District Zone,
which is delineated on the Fairhope Municipal Airport Overlay Zoning Map adopted as part of the Airport
Overlay District Zoning Ordinance of the City of Fairhope, Alabama.
4. Noise Requirements - Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, noise sensitive structures shall
incorporate outdoor-to-indoor noise level reduction measures into the design and/or construction of the
structure.
a. Noise Attenuation Performance Standards  The performance standard for the level of sound attenuation
for noise sensitive structures constructed in the Airport Overlay District Zone shall be equivalent to
achieving an interior noise level of 45 dB (A-weighted) when the structure is exposed to an outdoor noise
exposure level of 65 Ldn or higher.
b. Noise Attenuation Methods  Noise reduction may be accomplished through design standards and/or
construction materials. Noise attenuation design measures and materials are referenced in the City
Standard Building Code of the City of Fairhope, as amended. In all cases, construction shall conform with
the general requirements of the City Standard Building Code of the City of Fairhope as amended.
c. Noise Attenuation in Noise Sensitive Commercial Structures  Only those portions of commercial
structures associated with noise sensitive activities must incorporate noise level reduction measures
sufficient to achieve an interior noise level of 45 dB (A-weighted) when the structure is exposed to an
outdoor noise exposure level of 65 Ldn or higher.
d. Architect or Engineer Review  An architect or engineer shall review the plans to determine if the building
design complies substantially with the intent of the ordinance.
e. Aviation Easement  The owner applying for approval to construct a noise sensitive structure or residential
subdivision within the area under the Runway Approach Surfaces located within the Airport Noise Overlay
District shall agree to grant to the Fairhope Airport Authority, without compensation, an aviation easement
Article V Section H
Special Districts Medical Overlay District
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 51
for the passage of aircraft and the right to cause in all airspace above the surface of the Grantors property
noise and other effects that may be caused by aircraft operating at the Fairhope Municipal Airport.
5. Use Restriction  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Ordinance, no use shall be made of structures,
land, or water within the Airport Overlay District Zone to:
a. create physical or electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the
airport and aircraft;
b. make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, or result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport;
c. create bird strike hazards; or
d. otherwise endanger or interfere in any way with the landing, take off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending
to use the airport.
6. Nonconforming uses
a. Regulations Not Retroactive: The Airport Overlay shall not require the removal, soundproofing, or other
change or alteration of any noise sensitive structure not conforming to the regulations as of the effective
date of this Ordinance, or otherwise interfere with continuance of a nonconforming use.
b. Building Additions: A non-conforming noise sensitive structure existing at the time this Ordinance is
enacted may be extended or enlarged, provided the extension or enlargement to the structure meets the
requirements of this Ordinance.
c. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed: Whenever the Director of Planning and Building
determines that a nonconforming noise sensitive structure has been abandoned, or more than 50 percent
destroyed, physically deteriorated, or decayed (based on assessed value), the rebuilding or repair of the
structure shall comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.
7. Permits
a. Building Permit Required: No noise sensitive structure shall be constructed in the Airport Overlay District
unless a permit has been applied for and granted by the Planning and Building Department. Each
application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to determine whether the resulting structure would conform to these regulations.
b. Variances: An application for a variance in the Airport overlay shall first be submitted to the Airport
Authority. If the Airport Authority does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the
applicant may file an appeal with Board of Adjustments and Appeals. The Board of Adjustment and
Appeals may act on its own to grant or deny the application
c. Permit Application Requirements: An application for a permit shall be accompanied by a plat or plan
showing the location of the lot to be built upon and the location of the proposed structure; a certification
from a registered architect, engineer, or acoustician that the plans for the structure include noise attenuation
measures adequate to meet the requirements of this Ordinance; together with such other information as the
Planning and Building Department may deem necessary to enforce properly the provisions of this
Ordinance.
F. P-1  Parking District
1. Intent  The Parking District designates one or more lots, parcels, tracts, or sites to be used exclusively for the
parking of vehicles, either outdoors or indoors. Lands in the P-1 District shall not be used for the construction
of any building or structure other than as specifically permitted herein.
2. Uses  Parking lots are the only use allowed in the P-1 Parking District. Parking garages may be permitted on
appeal in the P-1 District, where the Board has determined the use to be compatible with other uses existing in
the neighborhood. Lands occupied by buildings or structures shall not be designated P-1 while such buildings
or structures exist. No parking garage shall exceed two (2) stories or thirty-feet (30) in height except upon
approval of the planning commission.
3. Lot Area, Width and Maximum Coverage  None specified, except that all lots in the P-1 district shall
comply with the intent and requirements regarding parking size, dimension, landscape, and site design standards
of other zoning districts.

FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 63
5. Site Design Standards  General site design standards contained in Article IV. apply to the VRM district in
addition to the following specific site design standards.
a Open space: Refer to Article IV., Section A. for general open space design standards. The following
additional open space standards apply in the VRM district:
(1) At least 80% of the dwellings should be within one mile of three different types of open space.
(2) At least 80% of the residential units should be within one mile from each category (natural and civic)
of open space
(3) At least 80% of the residential units should be within 1980 feet of 1 or more types of open space.
(4) Off-site open space may count towards the requirements of this section if it is publicly accessible.
(5) Accessory dwelling units shall not count towards the dwelling unit percentage recommendations of
this section.
(6) Distance shall be measured along public right-of-way or public trail or greenway.
b. Streetscape: Refer to Article IV., Section
C. for general streetscape design
standards. The following additional
streetscape standards apply in the VRM
district:
(1) The average building line on opposite
sides of the street shall not differ by
more than 20 feet.
(2) The building line on an individual lot
shall not differ by more than five feet
from the building line of adjacent
lots. See Figure 6-1.
(3) The building line on an individual lot
shall not differ by more than five feet
from the average building line on the
same side of a single block.
(4) No more than two frontage types may
be used on the same side of a single
block. See Figure 6-1.
(5) The preferred height to width ratio for
the streetscape (height of buildings:
distance between facades on opposite
sides of street) should be between 1:2
and 1:4, except in the case of singlefamily
dwellings on arterial streets
where a larger setback may create an
appropriate transition for single-family
Commentary
See Article IV., Section C. for a description, intent and goals of the streetscape. A defined streetscape is
created by a ratio of height to width formed by buildings on opposite sides of the street. The width
includes the width of the right-of-way and the depth of any private setback to the building façade. The
height equals the average height of buildings along a block, or the height of the primary façade to any
substantially recessed areas. See Figure 6-3 for diagrams relating to the streetscape and the proper ratio
of height to width.
Figure 6-1. This figure illustrates two different frontage types
 a terrace and a yard  while still maintaining consistent
setbacks (no greater deviation than 5 feet) on adjacent lots.
Article VI Section A
Village Districts VRM Village Residential Mix
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 64
dwelling units on higher-order streets. See Figure 6-2
(6) This section shall not apply to estate dwelling units or civic uses.
c. Site Access: Refer to Article IV., Section D. for general
site access standards. The following additional site
access standards apply in the VRM district:
(1) Curb cuts on local streets shall be separated by a
minimum of 60 feet.
(2) Shared access driveways or rear access lanes shall
be used on blocks with residential lots less than 60
feet wide. Shared access driveways require an
easement to each lot owner indicated on the plat and
recorded or granted by a separate deed instrument.
See Figure 6-3.
d. Parking: Refer to Article IV., Section E. for general
parking standards. The following additional parking
standards apply in the VRM district:
(1) The maximum size of an off-street parking area
for any use in the NVM district is 40 spaces.
(2) All off-street parking in the NVM district shall be
on the same lot as the use the parking serves, or on
dedicated common area for a group of lots. Any
parking on common areas shall be within 100 feet
of the structure it is to serve
(3) On-street parking may be used towards required
parking according to Article IV., Section E.
(4) All off-street parking areas shall be located behind
buildings, except for estate dwelling units and
single-family detached dwelling units.
(5) All off-street parking shall be screened from
adjacent lots according to Article IV., Section E.
Figure 6-2. This figure illustrates the ideal ratio of building heights that frame the streetscape to the total
width of the streetscape area. Streetscapes closer to the 2:1 end of this range should be used as transitions
near village centers.
Figure 6-3. Rear access lanes or shared driveways
shall be used on all lots less than 60 feet wide.
Commentary
Vehicular access on individual lots interrupts the pedestrian area of the streetscape. This conflict is
exaggerated when accessing smaller compact lots. Therefore alternative vehicular access must be used
when lots are narrow.

Shared driveways
Article VI Section A
Village Districts VRM Village Residential Mix
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 65
e. Building Design: The following building design standards apply
in the VRM district:
(1) All structures shall have a primary entrance that faces the
street.
(2) All primary entrances, except for estate dwelling units, shall
be connected to the public right-of-way by a sidewalk at least
four feet wide, or by a similar pedestrian connection.
(3) Garages shall be subject to the following:
(a) Detached garages may be located behind the rear
building line subject to dimension standards for the
district.
(b) Front entry garages shall be set back a minimum of
20 feet from the front building line containing the
primary entrance. See Figure 6-4.
(c) The portion of the facade used for front-entry garages
shall be less than 50% of the reaming portion of the front
facade producing at least a 2:1 ratio of living space to
garage space on front facades.
(d) Any front entry garage door shall be for a single vehicle.
Multiple car front-entry garages shall require multiple
single-entry doors. See Figure 6-5
f. Design Guidelines: The following design elements are
recommended in the VRM district:
(1) Roofs - Pitched roofs are preferred. Buildings with a flat
roof should incorporate a parapet or decorative cornice
line.
(2) Scale  Buildings should not exceed a height to width
ratio of 1 to 2 without a variation in the building mass to
break up the scale. Variations in building mass could
include a setback in the facade between 18 inches and 3
feet. Any such variation should occur over at least 25%
of the entire facade. See Figure 6-6.
(3) Architectural Style  the architectural style and materials
should be compatible on all sides of a building.
(4) Entrances - All primary entrances should be
articulated by any of the following design elements:
(a) A single story porch at least eight feet deep and
covering at least 50% of the facade;
(b) A single story portico at least six feet deep and at
least eight feet wide.
(c) A stoop entry if a stoop frontage is used.
(5) Openings  Window and door openings should be
vertically oriented, however windows and doors should
be grouped to have a similar orientation as the structure.
All front facades should have between 15% and 30% of
the façade occupied by windows or doors.
See Figure 6-7
(6) Diversity - Buildings should present diverse but
consistent appearances. Consistency will be determined
by the scale and mass of structures and diversity will be
determined by variation of facade planes, roof lines,
materials and colors used for external walls and trim.
All materials should be consistent with the overall
character of the neighborhood.
Figure 6-5. Only single entry doors are allowed if
the garage is front loaded and facing the street.
Figure 6-7. All openings should be vertically
oriented to reflect a pedestrian scale but may be

(1) Uses  The majority of ground level uses should
be from the Retail category. Service and Civic
uses are also acceptable on ground levels
provided they are not more than 50% of the
gross floor area. Office or Residential uses may
be appropriate on ground levels in limited
circumstances, but should generally be on upper
levels of buildings.
(2) Roofs  Roofs should be either pitched between
6:12 and 12:12 or be flat with parapets or
decorative cornices. Roof mounted equipment
should be screened from public view on all sides.
(3) Scale  Buildings should not exceed a height to
width ratio of 1:3 without a variation in the
building mass to break up the scale. Variations in
building mass could include an offset in the
building height between 10% and 15%, or a
setback in the facade between three and six feet.
Any such variation should occur over at least 25%
of the entire facade. See Figure 6-14.
(4) Architectural Style  All buildings should include a
base, body, and crown. Transitions between these
areas should occur at floor changes or at the cornice
line of the roof. Transitions should be created by
material or color changes or the use of ornamental
features. The architectural style and materials
should be consistent on all sides of a building.
(5) Building Height  Building heights should not differ
by more than 15% on a single block, except that
taller buildings that anchor a corner may not be
considered in calculating the block average. See
Figure 6-15.
Figure 6-12. Building facades shall occupy at least
75% of the lot frontage at the front building line.

(c) an entrance recessed from the
front façade between 3 and 5
feet; See Figure 6-16c.
(d) a combination of ornamental
architectural molding and
windows such as transom
windows. See Figure 6-16a.
(7) Openings  Window and door
openings should be vertically
oriented, however windows and
doors should be grouped to have a
similar orientation as the structure.
Building entrances should occur a
minimum of every 50 feet along
street frontages. See Figure 6-17.
(8) Diversity  Buildings should present
diverse but consistent appearances.
Changes in material, color or relief
areas are acceptable when used as
accents to the primary materials,
color, and wall. Use of visual
features such as awnings, ornamental
doors and windows, and architectural
details are encouraged to create
diversity.

FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 78
Article VII
Non-conformities
A. Purpose and Intent
B. Non-conforming Structures
C. Non-conforming Uses
D. Non-conforming Lots
E. Maintenance of Non-conformities
F. Adjacent Land
A. Purpose and Intent
This ordinance seeks to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and avoid any unreasonable invasion
of established private property rights. The elimination of existing buildings and structures or uses that are not in
conformance with the provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the
prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance. Lawful nonconformities
can adversely affect orderly development, maintenance, and use and taxable values throughout the
City. To avoid undue hardship, non-conformities that came into existence lawfully should be allowed to exist
subject to conditions in this Article; however, the conditions should seek to ultimately secure compliance with the
comprehensive plan.
B. Non-conforming Structures
Structures that were legally constructed prior to the adoption of this ordinance, but which could not be constructed
under the terms of this ordinance are considered legal non-conforming structures. A legal non-conforming structure
may continue to exist subject to the following:
1. Alteration and expansions may follow the non-conforming setback only on the non-conforming side.
2. The structure shall remain legal in all other regards except for the non-conformance that existed upon adoption
of the ordinance that made the structure non-conforming.
3. A non-conforming structure, which is not intentionally damaged, destroyed, or removed, may be restored within
one year from the date of the event. If the structure is not re-constructed in one year all restorations and
improvements shall be in compliance with applicable ordinances. The burden of proof of date of damage or
destruction shall be on the person proposing the restoration.
Article VII Section C
Non-conformities Non-conforming Uses
FAIRHOPE ZONING ORDINANCE 79
C. Non-conforming Uses
Use of land or structure that legally existed prior to the adoption of this ordinance, but which could not be initiated
under the terms of this ordinance is considered a legal non-conforming use. A legal non-conforming use of land or
structures may continue to exist subject to the following:
1. The use shall be restricted to the lot and building occupied by the use as of the effective date of the ordinance
creating the non-conformance. A legal non-conforming use shall not be extended to any other building or lot or
part of a lot.
2. A lawful non-conforming use that ceases for any reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days shall
not be reinitiated unless it is in compliance with all ordinances. If a legal non-conforming use is replaced by a
conforming use, the legal non-conforming use shall not be reinitiated.
3. Any site characteristic of a use, whether conforming to this ordinance or a legal non-conforming use, in
existence prior to adoption of this ordinance (such as parking, landscaping, or driveways) shall be considered
legal. However, any change in use, expansion of the use, or expansion of the structure associated with the use
shall require all non-conforming site characteristics to be brought in conformance with this ordinance.
4. A change of a legal non-conforming use shall only be allowed if the change is to a conforming use or to a use
that is considered less non-conforming, as determined by the Director of Planning and Building, either in extent
of non-conformance or in intensity.
D. Non-conforming Lots
Where a lot, tract or parcel of land has an area or width that does not conform to the requirements of the district in
which it is located, the lot may be used for a detached single-family dwelling except in the M-1 and M-2 Industrial
Districts. A single detached family dwelling may be constructed in an R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, or R-5 Residential
District provided the lot to be so used has a minimum area of four thousand (4,000) square feet and a minimum lot
width at the building line of forty (40) feet, provided it is located on a public sewer.
Yard requirements shall be modified subject to the following conditions:
1. On double frontage lots (interior lots abutting two (2) streets) the required front yard shall be provided on each
street.
2. The side yard requirements for substandard lots of record may be reduced for each side yard at the rate of one
(1) foot for each four (4) feet by which the lot width lacks fifty (50) feet, provided in no event shall such side
yard be reduced to less than five (5) feet on each side.
3. The front setback (and, on corner lots, the street side setback) shall not apply to any lot where the average
setbacks in the same block and within 200 feet of the subject lot is less than the minimum setback required for
the district. In such cases, the proposed building may be aligned with the buildings existing on either side
thereof.
4. On corner lots, the street side yard shall be that part of the lot having its greatest frontage abutting that right-ofway
and the required setback shall be 20 feet, unless otherwise provided herein.
E. Maintenance of Non-conformities
In the interest of public safety and health, routine maintenance of non-conforming situations shall continue as
warranted by the property owner or otherwise required by law, provided that no maintenance involves continuance
or expansion of the non-conformity contrary to this Article.
F. Adjacent Land
The presence of a non-conforming use in a zoning district shall not be allowable as grounds for the granting of
variances for other surrounding properties by the board of adjustment.

Bio-filter: A stormwater management facility that treats stormwater by filtration through vegetation, which as been
recognized and approved as a Best Management Practice.
Bioretention: This technique removes pollutants in stormwater runoff through adsorption, filtration, sedimentation,
volatilization, ion exchange, and biological decomposition. A Bioretention Cell (BRC) is a depression in the
landscape that captures and stores runoff for a short time, while providing habitat for native vegetation that is both
flood and drought tolerant. BRCs are stormwater control measures (SCMs) that are similar to the homeowner
practice, of installing rain gardens, with the exception that BRCs have an underlying specialized soil media and are
designed to meet a desired stormwater quantity treatment storage volume. Peak runoff rates and runoff volumes can
be reduced and groundwater can be recharged when bioretention is located in an area with the appropriate soil
conditions to provide infiltration. Bioretention is normally designed for the water quality or first flush event,
typically the first 1-1.5 of rainfall, to treat stormwater pollutants.

ORDINANCE NO. 1550
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 1253
KNOWN AS THE ZONING ORDINANCE
The ordinance known as the Zoning Ordinance (No. 1253), adopted 27 June 2005, is
changed and altered as described below;
WHEREAS, the City of Fairhope Planning Commission directed the Planning Department
to prepare amendments to our Zoning Ordinance; and,
WHEREAS, the proposed amendments relate to revisions of the parking requirement section
to include provisions for low impact development strategies and inserting additional
definitions; and,
WHEREAS, after the appropriate public notice and hearing of ZC 15.07, the Planning
Commission of the City of Fairhope, Alabama has forwarded a favorable recommendation;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY
OF FAIRHOPE, ALABAMA;
THAT, Article 4, Site Design Standards, Section E Parking is hereby revised as follows:
I . Insert a new subsection 3 that reads:
a. Compact Car Parking Requirement:
Compact car parking spaces shall be a minimum of 30% of the required
parking spaces and no more than a maximum of 40% of the required
parking spaces. Compact car spaces shall be grouped together to the
greatest extent possible. Compact car spaces shall be designated by paint at
the entrance of the parking stall.
2. Insert a new subsection 4 that reads:
a. Parking Dimension and Size:
I) Standard parking lot dimensions
2) Compact car parking dimensions
width
depth
8'
15 '
8'
16.8'
3. The existing subsection 4 is re-numbered to section 5
4. Insert a new subsection 6 that reads:
8'
16.5'
a. Low Impact Development (LID) Parking Requirements
Landscaping is required for all parking lots. The interior parking lot
landscaping requirements shall use LID techniques and be designed by an
Alabama licensed Professional Engineer and an Alabama licensed Landscape
Architect or designer. The following LID techniques shall be used in the
interior of all parking lots containing 12 or more parking spaces. The LID
parking requirement landscape plan will be reviewed in accordance with the
Tree Ordinance. Any landscaping plan submitted in accordance with this
subsection shall include technique 5 below and at least one of the other
following techniques:
Ordinance No. 1550
Page -2-
I) First Flush Treatment: The LID landscaping design shall be sized
appropriately to treat the first one inch of runoff into the receiving
parking lot LID area.
2) Bio-retention.
3) Rain Garden.
4) Vegetated Swale.
5) Permeable Pavement Systems: Permeable pavement systems are a
required LID technique. I 00% of parking provided over and above
the minimum parking requirements shall be permeable pavement
systems. Typical systems are brick pavers, pervious asphalt, and
pervious concrete. Other systems may be approved if the design
engineer provides adequate documentation that demonstrates the
proposed technique is equally or more effective that the typical
permeable systems listed. Approval of a proposed technique is at
the sole discretion of the City during the permitting process.
6) Tree and Ground Cover Plantings: When trees are required in a
parking lot by the Tree Ordinance they shall be included and
integrated into the LID design. Species shall be as approved by the
City Horticulturist and must be suggested by the landscape
architect or designer. There shall be no bare ground exposed and
all ground cover proposed shall be integral to the success of LID
techniques. All ground cover shall be as approved by the City
Horticulturist and must be suggested by the landscape architect or
designer.
5. That Article lX Definitions and Interpretation Section C. defined terms are amended
to add the following:
a. Bioretention: This technique removes pollutants in stormwater runoff
through adsorption, filtration , sedimentation, volatilization, ion exchange,
and biological decomposition. A Bioretention Cell (BRC) is a depression in
the landscape that captures and stores runoff for a short time, while
providing habitat for native vegetation that is both flood and drought
tolerant. BRCs are stormwater control measures (SCMs) that are similar to
the homeowner practice, of installing rain gardens, with the exception that
BRCs have an underlying specialized soil media and are designed to meet a
desired stormwater quantity treatment storage volume. Peak runoff rates and
runoff volumes can be reduced and groundwater can be recharged when
bioretention is located in an area with the appropriate soil conditions to
provide infiltration. Bioretention is normally designed for the water quality
or "first flush" event, typically the first I" -1.5" of rainfall, to treat
stormwater pollutants.
b. Vegetated Swale: is a shallow, open-channel stabilized with grass or other
herbaceous vegetation designed to filter pollutants and convey stormwater.
Swales are applicable along roadsides, in parking lots, residential
subdivisions, commercial developments, and are well suited to single-family
residential and campus type developments. Water quality swales are
designed to meet sheer stress targets for the design storm, may be
characterized as wet or dry swales, may contain amended soils to infiltrate
stormwater runoff, and are generally planted with turf grass or other
herbaceous vegetation.
c. First Flush: This is the given volume of water generated in the drainage
area from the first I" to 1.5'' of rainfall.
Ordinance No. 1550
Page- 3-
d. Rain Garden: a shallow depression in a landscape that captures water and
holds it for a short period of time to allow for infiltration, filtration of
pollutants, habitat for native plants, and effective storm water treatment for
small-scale residential or commercial drainage areas. Rain gardens use
native plants, mulch, and soil to clean up runoff.
