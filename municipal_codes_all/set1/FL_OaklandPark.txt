PREFACE 
    This volume contains the Charter and Code of Ordinances of the City. The Code constitutes a 
complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Oakland Park of a general and permanent nature. 
As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or 
recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. This Code was subsequently republished in 1995. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1960 Oakland Park Code, adopted by 
Ordinance No. 229, as supplemented through November 4, 1970 (Ordinance No. 518), and ordinances 
subsequently adopted by the City Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note 
appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new 
and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Ordinance Disposition 
Table appearing in the back the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1960 Code, as 
supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Numbering System 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each 
chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code 
together and which refer to correlative charter provisions and relevant state laws have been included. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal 
codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the 
dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section 
within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of 
Chapter 4 is 4-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, 
new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal 
system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would 
logically come between Sections 4.4 and 4.5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be 
numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4.4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction 
after the chapter number, e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be 
designated as Chapter 12 1/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is 
maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same 
way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of each chapter embracing the subject, and, in 
the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive 
number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The Charter and Code Indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item 
has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others 
in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are 
numerous cross references which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he 
is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the 
Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of 
amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. 
These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of 
inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into 
the Code, may be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder 
of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have 
the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the 
publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, 
in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgements 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Lewis D. Haines, City Attorney, and Miss Darleen Mitchell, 
City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on the original Code. It is 
hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make 
the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-
day administration of the City's affairs. 
    The City authorized the republication of this Code in May 1995, and this volume is issued as a 
replacement copy to replace all existing copies of the Code as published in 1974 and supplemented 
through Supplement Number 37. 
    The July 1995 republication was under the supervision of Lori A. Story, Editor, of the Municipal Code 
Corporation, and credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff who provided 
assistance throughout this project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Ms. Carol Gold, CMC/AAE, City Clerk, for her participation, 
cooperation and interest during the preparation of this republication of the Code. 
    This republication was under the supervision of Edwin D. March, Editor, of the Municipal Code 
Corporation, and credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff who provided 
assistance throughout this project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Ms. Carol Landau, CMC/AAE, City Clerk, for her participation, 
cooperation and interest during the preparation of this republication of the Code.

change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or delete pages

CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— The City of Oakland Park was originally incorporated as the Town of Floranada by Ch. 
11482, Laws of Florida, Special Acts of 1925. On June 10, 1929, by Ch. 14041, it was reincorporated as 
Oakland Park. After a number of subsequent acts amending such chapter or reincorporating the city, its 
present charter was adopted by the State Legislature in 1959 as Ch. 59-1622, which was filed in the 
office of the Secretary of State June 17, 1959, and which became effective at 8:00 a.m. on July 15, 1959.

such renumbering and gives the location herein of the original articles and sections. Where necessary, 
the editor has changed internal references to articles and sections to reflect the renumbering.

and any amendatory act or ordinance. Any phrases enclosed in brackets [ ] were added by the editor for 
clarity.

mayor shall succeed to the position of mayor, the vice mayor elect shall succeed to the position 
of vice mayor, and the vacant commission seat shall be filled by appointment as provided for in

mayor or vice mayor. If a majority of said remaining commission members are unable to agree 
on a selection to fill a vacancy of a commission member after two (2) regular meetings have

qualified nominees upon which the city commission is deadlocked. The city clerk shall conduct 
the selection by lot and certify the results. 
(2) ?Special elections. If no regular city or general election or any election is scheduled within six (6) 
months, the commission shall schedule a special election to fill the unexpired term of a 
commission member held not sooner than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days 
following the occurrence of the vacancy or vacancies. In any special election held for the 
purpose of this section, the provisions for candidates and elections in Article IX of this Charter 
shall apply. 
(3) ?Term. The term of office for vacancies filled by election shall be for the remainder of the 
unexpired term of the office in which the vacancy exists.

elections shall be qualified and elected according to the provisions of Article IX of this Charter. 
(5) ?Quorum requirements. Notwithstanding any quorum requirements established by this Charter, 
if at any time the membership of the commission is reduced to less than a quorum, the 
remaining members may, by majority vote, appoint an interim additional commission member to 
serve until the next regular city or general election if less than six (6) months remain until that 
election. If, however, following the appointment of the interim commission member in order to 
have a quorum for the conduct of municipal affairs, there shall be more than six (6) months 
remaining before the next city or general election, the commission shall call a special election to 
elect additional members in order to form a whole commission, including the position occupied 
by the interim, additional commission member. In the event that the remaining members of a 
commission lacking a quorum are unable to agree on the appointment of an interim, additional 
commission member after two (2) weeks of deliberation, the governor shall appoint such 
interim, additional commission member in order to provide a quorum for the conduct of 
municipal affairs. 
(6) ?Extraordinary vacancies. In the event that all members of the commission are removed by 
death, disability or forfeiture of office, the governor shall appoint an interim commission that

RULE IV. - THE CLASSIFICATION PLAN 


Sec. 2-92. - The purpose. 
    The classification plan provides a complete inventory of all positions in the city service and accurate 
descriptions and specifications for each class of employment. The plan standardizes titles, each of which 
is indicative of a definite range of duties and responsibilities and has the same meaning throughout the 
city service. The classification plan shall be based on appropriate, objective job evaluation and should be 
maintained on a current basis. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06) 


Sec. 2-93. - Composition of the classification plan. 
    The classification plan consists of: 
(a) ?Classes of positions which are established by grouping positions which are basically similar to 
the kind of work and level of difficulty and responsibility, which require similar experience and 
training at time of recruitment, and which may be compensated fairly from within the same 
range of pay under similar working conditions. 
(b) ?Classification titles which are descriptive of the work performed and which identify each class. 
(c) ?Written classification description for each class of positions which contain a description of the 
nature of the work and of the relative responsibility of the positions in the class, examples of 
work which are illustrative of duties of positions allocated to the class, requirements of work in 
terms of knowledge, abilities and skills necessary for performance of the work and a statement 
of experience and training desirable for recruitment into the class. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06) 


Sec. 2-94. - Classification title. 
    Classification titles shall be used in all personnel, accounting, budget, appropriation and financial 
records. No person shall be appointed to, or employed in, a position in the classified service under a title 
not included in the classification plan. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06) 


Sec. 2-95. - Classification descriptions. 
    Descriptions are to be interpreted in their entirety and in relation to others in the classification plan. 
Particular phrases or examples are not to be isolated and treated as a whole definition of the class. 
Descriptions are deemed to be an explanation of the kind of work performed and not necessarily inclusive 
of all duties performed. 
    Each time a new classification is established, a classifications description shall be written and 
incorporated in the existing plan. The classification title shall be added to the list of titles. Likewise, an 
abolished classification shall be automatically deleted from the classification plan by removing the 
classification title from the list of titles. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06) 


Sec. 2-95.1. - Substantive changes to classifications descriptions. 
    It is recognized that the skills needed to perform in classifications may change over time as a result 
of changes in technology or equipment used to perform the job, changing industry practices and 
standards, and the changing needs of the city. Should substantive changes in the skills, knowledge and 
abilities required to perform in a classification be made, those changes shall be incorporated into the 
classification specifications and the Director of Human Resources shall make a determination of what a 
reasonable period of time would be to provide incumbents to complete needed training or education 
courses and/or demonstrate the new level of proficiency or knowledge required. Incumbent employees in 
those classifications shall be advised by the director of human resources of those requirements and of the 
time frame within which they would need to demonstrate proficiency or knowledge at the level specified. 
In addition, the city shall take reasonable steps to assist the incumbents in receiving the training or 
education needed. This assistance will vary according to the cost and extent of training or education 
needed, but may take the form of tuition reimbursement, time off to attend training courses, access to on-
line training, onsite delivery of training, or other assistance. The availability of that assistance shall be 
clearly communicated to affected incumbents. If an incumbent employee cannot demonstrate the level of 
proficiency or knowledge required after the period of time set by the director of human resources, the 
matter should be dealt with as a performance issue as provided for elsewhere in these rules.

maintenance of the classification plan so that it will reflect on a current basis the duties being performed 
by each employee in the city service and the class to which each position is allocated. 
    The director of human resources shall periodically review the classification of positions utilizing 
professional job classification techniques and, upon the basis of that review shall recommend to the city 
manager appropriate and necessary amendments to the classification plan in the form of new classes, 
revisions of existing classes. Such recommended amendments shall be effective when approved by the 
city manager and the civil service board.

city manager, and after consulting with the department, division or office director involved, the 
director of human resources shall cause a position classification questionnaire to be completed 
covering the duties and responsibilities of the proposed position. The director of human 
resources shall then allocate the position to one of the classes in the classification plan. If a 
suitable classification does not exist, the director of human resources shall recommend the 
establishment of a new classification and, after adoption of the new class, shall allocate the 
position to it. 
(b) ?Reorganization. It shall be the duty of each department, division or office director to submit to 
the director of human resources new position classification questionnaires for all affected 
positions each time a department, division or office under his or her jurisdiction is permanently 
and substantially reorganized.

(1) ?A department head has reason to believe that a position in his or her department is 
improperly allocated and requests in writing that the director of human resources review 
the allocation of that position. 
(2) ?The director of human resources determines that positions are inappropriately allocated 
during periodic reviews of individual positions or classes or groups of classes.

position and satisfying the conditions in section 2-96.1, the director of human resources shall 
place the position in question in its appropriate classification. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06) 


Sec. 2-96.1 - Reclassification of existing positions.

(b) ?Positions will not be reclassified when: 
(1) ?The added duties and responsibilities are minor in nature and are a logical function of the 
class; or 
(2) ?The added duties and responsibilities are to be performed for a temporary period only; or 
(3) ?The primary change involved is an increase in the employee's workload; or 
(4) ?The primary purpose is to effectuate a promotion and thereby to raise the employee's salary; or

specifically trained in the evaluation of classification and salary determinations and, are not subject to 
review through the civil service grievance procedure. 
    Decisions may be appealed in writing to the director of human resources in writing within fifteen (15) 
calendar days of the original decision. The appellant should indicate why he/she believes the original 
decision was not proper, what factors were not credited or given sufficient credit, and any other pertinent 
information which will support the appeal.

for similar employment in the Oakland Park labor market, rates of pay in other governmental jurisdictions, 
inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, the total compensation package including benefits, 
the financial policies of the city and other economic considerations. 
    The intent of the salary ranges in the pay plan shall be to provide an avenue to award salary 
increases based on individual performance levels, provide administrative flexibility to recognize individual 
differences, and provide employee incentives for meritorious service. No employee shall receive a wage 
adjustment/increase which would bring the employee above the top of the salary range for their job 
classification. 
(a) ?The minimum rate of pay for a class shall normally be paid to any employee on his or her 
original appointment to a position, however under certain circumstances such as special 
qualifications or experience, the employee may be placed within the classification range by

vary from zero (0) percent to one and one-half (1.5) percent according to the employee's 
performance evaluation, the criteria set forth by performance standards, and upon

specific period. The acceptance of such appointment by an eligible person shall not affect his or her

made. Transfers must be approved by the department heads affected, the director of human resources, 
and shall be executed on the prescribed form. Transfers are not encouraged during a probationary 
period, but can be made if the department head in the department where the employee currently is 
assigned also approves. 
    Any employee who is transferred shall be on probation for six (6) months in their new position.

appointment except those positions filled through promotion. The probationary period for promotional 
appointments shall be six (6) months, with the exception of an employee who is promoted while still in 
their initial probationary period with the city. In the latter case, the employee's probationary period for the 
promotional appointment shall be increased to insure that the employee has served a full twelve (12) 
months on probation. The director of human resources may grant status to persons appointed from a 
reinstatement list without a probationary period. 
    The department head shall make a report concerning the employee's performance at the end of six 
(6) months of service and other such periodic reports during an employee's probationary period as the 
director of human resources may require and shall notify the director of human resources prior to 
completion of the probationary period whether the services of the employee have been satisfactory and

supervisors and to assure employees that their problems and complaints will be considered fairly, 
rapidly, and without reprisal. 
Scope: 
(1) ?The following provisions do not apply to employees covered by collective bargaining 
agreements unless specifically provided in their respective agreement, to employees in the 
nonclassified service, to employees in temporary or part time positions, or to employees who 
have not completed their probationary period.

of alleged retaliation for having engaged in activities protected by employment discrimination

outside agencies whose purpose it is to investigate such allegations, but shall not be entitled to 
use the grievance procedures herein set forth. 
(3) ?Separations due to reduction in force, lack of funds, or lack of work are not considered 
disciplinary in nature and shall not be subject to the grievance procedures herein set forth.

(b) ?Purpose. The primary purpose of this grievance procedure is to determine what is right rather than 
who is right. Free discussion between employees and supervisors will lead to a better understanding 
by both of practices, policies and procedures that affect employees.

conditions, to relationships between an employee and the employee's supervisor, or to relationships 
with other employees, which violate the provisions of these rules. Employees should first discuss any 
problem or complaint that is in the nature of a grievance either with their immediate supervisor or 
with the director of human resources. In many cases, the director of human resources, with the 
employee's consent will be able to work out a satisfactory solution or to advise the employee 
regarding further presentation of the grievance. Whether or not the employee takes the problem first 
to the director of human resources, the following procedure will be adopted for the presentation of all 
grievances not resolved by the immediate supervisor or director of human resources.

of human resources, or any other individual who may be qualified to offer assistance or 
information which will aid the supervisor to reach a mutually equitable decision.

not resolved in step one, the nature of the grievance and the desired solution must be submitted 
in writing by the employee to the human resources department within ten (10) working days 
from the date the employee became aware of the issue.

the employee and the department head whether the grievance is subject to established 
ordinances, administrative regulations or these rules. In the event that the director of human 
resources determines that the matter being grieved is subject to established ordinances, 
administrative regulations or provisions of the civil service rules, he or she shall advise the 
employee and department head in writing of that fact and explain how that ordinance, rule or 
regulation applies to the case in point. The communication from the director of human resources 
shall direct any action necessary to conform to established ordinances, rules or regulations.

established ordinances, regulations or rules, the department head shall then have the 
responsibility for rendering his or her decision on the grievance and shall inform the employee in 
writing of that decision within five (5) working days.

the employee, or if a decision is not rendered by the department head within five (5) working 
days of the director of human resources' communication, the employee may request in writing 
through the human resources department that the grievance be referred to the city manager or 
designee. All such requests will be forwarded to the City Manager or designee by the director of 
human resources without delay. This request must be filed by the employee within five (5) 
working days after receipt of the department head's decision. and, in any case, not later than

resources for submission to a grievance committee. The city manager or designee will act upon 
such appeals within ten (10) working days, from receipt of request. 
    Appointment of a grievance committee. When the director of human resources is so notified by the 
city manager, they shall assemble a grievance committee within ten (10) days following receipt of such 
notice. A grievance committee shall be composed of three (3) members that are regular employees of the 
City Of Oakland Park. One (1) member shall be selected by the employee or their representative, one (1) 
member shall be selected by the department head or their representative, and the third member, who 
shall serve as chairperson, shall be selected and mutually agreed upon by the first two (2). If an 
agreement cannot be reached, the director of human resources shall appoint the third member. The 
human resources department shall schedule a hearing to be held within fifteen (15) working days after 
selection of committee. 
    Recommendations of grievance committee. Within ten (10) working days following the conclusion of 
the hearing, the grievance committee chair person shall supply the city manager, or designee a written 
report and recommendation as approved by a majority of the committee. Upon receipt of the committee's 
report and recommendations, the city manager shall put in writing the course of action he or she intends 
to follow and shall forward one (1) copy of his or her decision and one (1) copy of the committee's report 
and recommendations to the department head; one (1) copy of each to the employee; and one (1) copy of 
each to the director of human resources. The fourth copy shall be retained by the city manager.

grievance committee, shall be final and the employee shall have no further right of city administrative 
appeal, and may appeal to the civil service board.

the classified service whose terms of employment are not governed by a collective bargaining agreement 
the right to have the civil service board review any action leading to the removal, suspension, or reduction 
in rank of the employee, or any action which the employee believes has resulted in the civil service rules 
being improperly applied or misinterpreted to the detriment of the employee. The civil service board shall 
have the final authority. 
    Such employees may appeal to the civil service board within thirty (30) days after receipt of final 
administrative decision. Upon such appeal, the department head, the appealing employee with counsel, if 
desired, and the city manager shall have the right to be heard and to present evidence. At the hearing of 
such appeal, technical rules of evidence shall not apply. The civil service board, and/or the appointed 
secretary of the board, shall have the power to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses and compel the 
production of documents, records and all papers pertinent to the appeal. 
    Said hearings shall be public hearings held, in an appropriate public place. On any appeal, which 
may come before the board, three (3) board members constitute a quorum. If only a quorum is present 
during a hearing, all members must concur in the motion on the board's decision in order for the decision 
to stand. However, if more than a quorum is present, the majority shall concur in a decision. A tie vote of 
all members present at the hearing shall constitute a denial of the appeal and such action shall be 
deemed the final determination of the board. 
    The board shall be free to make its determination of appellant's innocence or guilt in keeping with the 
public interest, based solely on the board's reasonable interpretation of all the pertinent information 
available. The board shall not be bound by a presumption of the appellant's innocence or guilt; such 
presumption does not prevail in administrative law. The findings of the board shall be based on 
competent substantial evidence before it. 
    In considering the appellant's fitness to hold employment in the classified service of the city, the 
board shall not be bound by the strict letter of the charges as drawn. The board may allow the charges to 
be amended at any time, as long as the amendment is material to the charges. In general, the board in its 
findings shall be guided, not by technicalities, but by the substance of the information developed in its 
hearings. 
    Upon a finding that just cause has existed for the suspension, demotion or dismissal, the board shall 
affirm the suspension, demotion or dismissal. 
    Upon a finding that just cause for disciplinary action existed, but did not justify the severity of the 
action taken, the board may, in its discretion: (1) reduce a dismissal to a suspension for such time as the 
board may fix; or (2) reduce the period of suspension; or (3) reinstate a demoted employee. 
    Upon a finding that the action complained of was taken for any prohibited reason, or as the result of 
misinterpretation of these civil service rules, or other insufficient reason, or just cause did not exist for the 
suspension, demotion or dismissal, the employee shall be reinstated to the position. 
    The employee involved may, upon recommendation by the board and approval by the city 
commission, receive any lost compensation and benefits and in addition, the cost and expenses 
reasonably incurred in presenting a defense.

undue burden or expense. 
(f) ?The order of proof shall be as follows: The city manager or designee, or the city attorney, as the 
case may be, shall present evidence in support of the charges; the appellant shall then produce

hearing, and such absence shall not be excused by the board, the board shall proceed to hear 
the evidence and render judgment thereon in absentia.

absence is not excused by the board, and if no evidence be offered in support of the charge or 
charges, the board may render judgment as by default or may hear evidence as offered by the 
removed employee and render judgment thereon; and the board shall notify the city manager, 
the department head and the removed employee of its judgment. 
(j) ?Admissible as evidence shall be written statements made by the appellants and others, 
transcripts of oral statements made by the appellants and others, and hearsay evidence, for

other types of evidence, or as to the consideration by the board, of any and all pertinent 
information. 
(k) ?Appellants and all other classified employees of the city may be required to testify. Refusal to 
testify shall be grounds for dismissal. Admissions against interest may be admitted as evidence.

(l) ?The civil service board attorney shall rule on all points of law and admissibility of evidence, and 
the ruling shall be binding on the board.

    Each employee's performance shall be evaluated by his or her immediate supervisor. The 
performance evaluation shall be approved by the division head, department head prior to the employee 
review, and the City Manager or designee before it is considered final. 
    A less than satisfactory overall rating on the performance evaluation constitutes a written reminder, 
and serves as an instruction for correcting a performance problem. The evaluation report shall include 
facts identifying the performance problem, an action plan to correct the problem, and an established 
follow-up date. In addition, a less than satisfactory rating in any category serves as a verbal warning. 
    Right to inspect files. Employees shall have the right to inspect their personnel files at reasonable 
times throughout the year. Any comments on contents of said files by the employee shall be entered into

Sec. 2-162. - Resignation. 
    Any employee wishing to leave the city service in good standing shall file with his or her department 
head, at least two (2) weeks before the effective date of the resignation, a written resignation stating the 
date the resignation shall become effective and the reason for leaving. Failure to comply with this 
procedure may be considered cause for denying such employee future employment by the City and shall 
not be considered a resignation in good standing. Department heads shall forward all notices of 
resignation to the director of human resources immediately upon receipt. 
    Employees who are absent from work for three (3) consecutive workdays without notifying their 
supervisor or another member of management in their work area are considered to have voluntarily 
resigned their employment. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06) 


Sec. 2-163. - Layoff. 
    The city manager may lay off any employee in the city service whenever such action is made 
necessary by reason of shortage of work or funds, the abolition of a position or because of changes in 
organization; however, no regular employee shall be laid off while there are temporary, provisional or 
probationary employees serving in the same class of position for which the regular employee is eligible 
and available. 
    Whenever the layoff of one (1) or more employees shall become necessary, the city manager shall 
notify the director of human resources at least ten (10) days in advance of the intended action and the 
reasons therefore. The director of human resources. shall recommend the order of layoff of regular 
employees to the city manager after a review of state and federal law, and the personnel files of 
employees in the department and classification affected. Employees with corrective action notices, 
disciplinary action, or below satisfactory performance evaluations that occurred within the prior two-year 
period may be recommended for layoff in advance of employees without such blemishes on their record. 
    Layoffs shall be made within classifications of positions and departments when probationary and 
regular employees are involved. Temporary and provisional employees, irrespective of department, shall 
be laid off first, in that order. Probationary employees shall be laid off before regular employees.

to the provisions of Florida Statutes and applicable federal laws. 
    For reductions in force affecting employees who are subject to a collective bargaining contract, the 
collective bargaining contract shall dictate the manner and order of layoffs. Regular employees who are 
laid off shall be placed on reemployment lists as provided in section 2-128 of these rules. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06; Ord. No. O-2012-018, § 2, 9-19-12) 


Sec. 2-164. - Performance improvement. 
    When an employee's conduct or performance is inconsistent with the needs and goals of the city, 
disciplinary actions up to and including termination may occur. The city uses a system of progressive 
notification to employees to correct performance and conduct problems. Since the level of misconduct 
may differ from case to case, the city retains the right to treat each occurrence on an individual basis 
without creating a precedent for situations which may arise in the future. Although progressive notification 
is encouraged when circumstances support such use, the severity and circumstances shall determine the 
nature of the notification up to an including termination. By way of example but not limitation, behaviors 
such as theft, sexual harassment, intentional discrimination, fighting, carrying a weapon, intoxication, 
possession or use of illegal drugs, consumption of alcohol at work, threats or acts of violence may result 
in termination on a first occurrence, regardless of previous history. 
(a) ?Documented verbal warning. Verbal notices are to clarify what is expected and to assist the 
employee in meeting performance expectations. They are not considered disciplinary action. 
(b) ?Written warning. A written notice is a formal written notice to an employee describing a breech 
of standards, conduct or other rules, regulations or policy. It is often used when constructive 
approaches to improve performance have not resulted in correction of the behavior or where an 
infraction has incurred that is of a more serious nature that requires a documented warning. 
(c) ?Final warning/1—3 day suspension or decision day. A final warning is the last warning for the 
same offense or several offenses prior to termination. 
A decision day is a day off with pay for an employee to decide if they wish to remain in the 
employ of the city. Upon return from a decision day, an employee who decides to remain with 
the city must present a written personal performance statement acceptable to the department 
head. 
(d) ?Administrative leave. The city manager may order the administrative leave of an employee with 
or without pay until completion of an inquiry, review, or investigation of alleged causes pending 
appropriate action. 
In the event there is concern for the safety of the public, other employees, city property or 
equipment, or exposure of the city to other serious liability, an administrative leave may be 
immediate and the employee advised of such leave by the department head or the department 
head's designee. In such cases, written notice of the leave and the reasons for it shall 
subsequently be mailed to the employee's address of record. 
(e) ?Separation of employment (dismissal). Dismissal is the involuntary termination of an employee 
from city service for disciplinary reasons. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06; Ord. No. O-2012-018, § 2, 9-19-12) 


Sec. 2-165. - Expectations of conduct. 
    The city expects all employees to demonstrate the highest degree of integrity, responsibility, and 
professional conduct at all times. All employees are representatives of the City of Oakland Park whether 
on or off duty. This is particularly important to remember when wearing a City of Oakland Park badge, 
uniform, or logo attire. 
    Violations of city or departmental rules may constitute misconduct for which an employee may be 
immediately placed on administrative leave, pending a complete investigation. All alleged violations 
should be thoroughly investigated and documented. 
    Although the following list is not all-inclusive, the following specific violations may result in severe 
disciplinary action up to an including discharge. This list is not all-inclusive. 
• ?Conviction or plea of nolo contendere, whether or not adjudication was withheld, to a criminal 
felony or misdemeanor which is job-related conduct, a crime involving moral turpitude, or failure 
to disclose such conviction or plea within five (5) working days.

instructions of the supervisory force which the employee may be reasonably expected to 
perform. 
• ?Offensive conduct, language or false or malicious public criticism of fellow employee, supervisor, 
officials or toward the public. 
• ?Instigating, leading or participating in any walkout, strike, sit-down, stand-in, slowdown, refusal to 
work at the scheduled time for the scheduled shifts, or other concerted curtailment or restriction 
of production or interference with work in or about the city's work stations. 
• ?Providing false information or refusing to provide information during the course of an 
investigation. 
    Consideration will be given to the employee's history of discipline for other matters, the nature and 
severity of the offense, any cost involved to the city in time or materials, the time interval between 
violations, and the length and quality of service record, in determining the appropriate action.

    When the city manager has determined a regular employee is unable to successfully perform the 
duties of his/her position, he or she may demote the regular employee to a position, in a class carrying a 
lower compensation, for which they meet the qualifications. A written statement of the reason for 
demotion shall be submitted to the employee affected and to the director of human Resources. 
    Demotion for disciplinary reasons is the reduction in classification and salary of an employee 
because of inability to perform or serious infractions or behavior that warrant very strong disciplinary 
action. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-006, § 2, 5-3-06) 


Sec. 2-167. - Suspension—Unpaid. 
    The city manager may, for disciplinary purposes, suspend an employee without pay for such length 
of time as the city manager considers appropriate, but not to exceed sixty (60) days in any twelve-month 
period. 
    A written statement of the reason for suspension shall be given to the director of human resources 
and to the employee affected within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the suspension becomes effective, 
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays granted by the City. 
    The city manager [may] suspend an employee without pay for a longer period pending the 
investigation or trial of any charge. Such employee determined to be innocent of the charges may be 
returned to duty with full pay for the period of suspension.

Sec. 2-197.2 - Bidding preference for local vendors. 
(a) ?Purpose and findings. The city annually spends significant dollars on purchasing personal property, 
materials and services, and in constructing improvements to real property or existing structures. The 
dollars used in making those purchases are derived, in part, from taxes, fees and utility revenues 
paid by businesses located within the corporate city limits, and the city commission has determined 
that funds generated in the community should, to the extent possible, be placed back into the local 
economy. Therefore, the city commission has determined that it is in the best interest of the city to 
give a preference to local businesses in making such purchases as provided for herein.

which the vendor operates or performs business on a day-to-day basis that is a substantial component of 
the goods or services being offered to Oakland Park. Post office boxes are not verifiable and shall not be 
used for the purpose of establishing said physical address. In order to be eligible for local preference, the 
vendor must provide a copy of the occupational license(s) for the covered period prior to recommendation 
for award. A business with outstanding liens, fines or violations with the city shall not be eligible to qualify 
for local preference. 
(c) ?Local preference; procedure. Except where otherwise provided by federal or state law or other 
funding source restrictions, purchases of goods, general services, or under the procurement code 
may give preference to local businesses in the following manner:

submits the lowest price bid, and the bid submitted by one (1) or more responsive, responsible 
local businesses is within two (2) percent of the price submitted by the non-local business, then 
that non-local business and each of the aforementioned responsive, responsible local 
businesses shall have the opportunity to submit, within five (5) working days of notice of intent 
to award, a best and final bid equal to or lower than the amount of the low bid previously 
submitted by the non-local business. Contract award shall be made to the responsive, 
responsible business submitting the lowest best and final bid. In the case of a tie in the best and 
final bid between a local business and a non-local business, contract award shall be made to 
the local business. 
(2) ?For all other competitive solicitations in which objective factors used to evaluate the responses 
from vendors are assigned point totals, if, upon the completion of final rankings (technical and 
price combined, if applicable) by the selection committee, a non-local business is the highest 
ranked proposer and the ranking of a local proposer is within five (5) percent of the ranking 
obtained by the non-local proposer, the highest ranked local proposer shall have the opportunity 
to proceed to negotiations with the city. 
    Vendors intending their bid submissions or proposals be considered under the provisions of local 
preference must identify themselves in writing as a local business in any response to competitive 
solicitations submitted to the city. 
(d) ?Waiver. The application of local preference to a particular purchase, contract, or category of 
contracts for which the city commission of the City of Oakland Park is the awarding authority may be 
waived upon written recommendation of the city manager and approval of the city commission. 
(e) ?Other preferences. The preferences established herein in no way prohibit the right of the city 
commission of the City of Oakland Park to compare quality of materials proposed for purchase and 
compare qualifications, character, responsibility and fitness of all persons, firms, or corporations

Sec. 7-11. - Fee assessment on telecommunications companies that occupy municipal rights-of-way for 
telecommunications facilities. 
(a) ?Purpose and application. 
(1) ?The purpose of this section is to establish fees for occupation of the city's rights-of-way for 
telecommunications facilities of telecommunications companies not otherwise paying a fee to 
the city for occupation of the city's rights-of-way. Any telecommunications company paying fees 
for the occupation of the city's rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities as of the effective 
date of this section shall continue to pay fees to the city as the company has been paying them. 
(2) ?The fees imposed pursuant to this section shall apply to all telecommunications companies 
occupying the city's rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities and not otherwise paying a 
fee to the city for occupation of the city's rights-of-way. 
(3) ?The fees imposed pursuant to this section are a fee and not a tax as specified in Section 
337.401, Florida Statutes (2000); consequently, (1) the payments to be made pursuant to this 
section 7-11 shall not be deemed to be in the nature of a tax; (2) such payments shall be in 
addition to any and all taxes of a general applicability; and (3) the fee specified herein is in 
consideration for occupation of the city's rights-of-way, including all public easements, for the 
purpose of erecting, constructing and maintaining telecommunications systems. 
(b) ?Fee for telecommunications company occupation of rights-of-way. 
(1) ?a. ?Any telecommunications company providing local telephone service, as defined in section 
203.012(3), Florida Statutes (2000), in the city and that is occupying municipal streets or 
rights-of-way within the corporate limits of the city with poles, wires or other fixtures shall 
pay to the city a fee in the amount of one (1) percent of the gross receipts on recurring 
local service revenues for services provided within the corporate limits of the city by such 
telecommunications company. Included within the fee are all taxes, licenses, fees, in-kind 
contributions accepted pursuant to section 337.401, Florida Statutes (2000), and other 
impositions except ad valorem taxes and amounts for assessments for special benefits, 
such as sidewalks, street pavings, and similar improvements, and occupational license 
taxes levied or imposed by the city upon the telecommunications company. 
b. ?In the event that a telecommunications company which provides telecommunications 
services defined as toll services in section 203.012(7), Florida Statutes (2000), occupies 
the city's rights-of-way, the telecommunications company shall pay to the city annually five 
hundred dollars ($500.00) per linear mile, which amount is prorated for any portion thereof, 
for any cable, fiber optic, or other pathway that makes physical use of the city's rights-of-
way. Such annual fee shall be prorated to reflect the expiration date of this section and 
shall be payable annually, in advance. If a telecommunications company that is required to 
pay a fee pursuant to this subsection (b)(1)b. increases the amount of its facilities 
occupying the city's rights-of-way after such advance payment has been made, but prior to 
the expiration date of this section, the fees due for the additional facilities shall be prorated 
and paid in full at the time the facilities are installed in the city's rights-of-way. 
The fee or other consideration imposed pursuant to this subsection (b)(1)b. shall not apply 
in any manner to any telecommunications company which provides local telephone service 
as defined in section 203.012(3), Florida Statutes (2000), for any services provided by 
such telecommunications company. 
c. ?Telecommunications company, as used in this section, shall have the meaning set forth in 
section 364.02(12), Florida Statutes (2000). 
(2) ?The fees provided for in subsection (1)a. shall be paid by the telecommunications company to 
the city in quarterly installment(s). The installment payment(s) shall be based upon such gross 
receipts on recurring local service revenues for the immediately preceding installment period or 
portion thereof after the effective date of this section, and shall be made within thirty (30) 
calendar days following the end of the period. Past due payments or underpayments shall bear 
interest accrued from the last day of the quarter for which the payment was due. Interest shall 
be paid at the Florida statutory rate of interest on judgments as established by section 55.03, 
Florida Statutes (2000). Payments shall include a statement as to how the fee amount was 
determined and the statement shall be certified by the telecommunications company's chief 
financial officer or other duly authorized representative of the company. 
(3) ?If the city wishes to verify the payments due to the city under this section, the 
telecommunications company shall permit the city or a designated representative of the city, 
upon reasonable advance written notice, and during normal business hours at the location of 
the telecommunications company where such records are maintained in the city, at another 
location satisfactory to the city, or elsewhere pursuant to subsections (b)(3)a. or b. below, to 
review or audit the telecommunications company's billing and payment records kept in the 
ordinary course of business upon which the payments were based. If a telecommunications 
company's records are not maintained in the city, the telecommunications company shall either: 
a. ?Pay all reasonable expenses, including travel, following the provisions of subsections 
112.061(6), (7) and (8), Florida Statutes (2000), to the city for the city to have a review or 
audit performed; or 
b. ?Provide the city with access to copies of the telecommunications company's records in the 
city or within fifty-five (55) miles of the city or by any electronic method satisfactory to the 
city. 
However, without the specific written consent of a telecommunications company's audit 
representative, no company records may be duplicated or taken from the telecommunications 
company's premises, and the city shall maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed 
in these records and use the information solely for the purposes of verifying payments by the 
telecommunications company. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as 
an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for sums due and payable under this 
section unless the city agrees in writing. In the event that the city, pursuant to final audit 
findings, determines that there exists a difference between the amount due to the city and the 
amount paid to the city, indicating an underpayment to the city, in excess of five (5) percent of 
the amount due, such telecommunications company shall pay all reasonable costs, fees and 
expenses of the audit. 
(4) ?This section is adopted consistent with the provisions of Section 337.401, Florida Statutes 
(2000), and other applicable provisions of law. This section shall not be construed as a waiver 
or limitation of the power of the city to prescribe and enforce reasonable rules and regulations 
pursuant to applicable provisions of law. 
(5) ?If required by applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a telecommunications company 
shall be registered with the city and obtain all permits that may be required by the city regarding 
occupation of the city's public rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities.

Sec. 7-12. - On-site shopping cart retention system required. 
(a) ?It is unlawful for any business establishment which uses twenty (20) or more shopping carts at any 
business location within the city to fail to install and maintain an on-site shopping cart retention 
system for the location. A "shopping cart" is a device which consists of a basket mounted on a frame 
with wheels capable of being moved by a person, which device is generally and ordinarily found and 
used in a retail commercial business establishment by a customer or employee of the establishment 
for the purpose of transporting goods or merchandise from one place to another. 
(b) ?Each such business establishment shall post signs in conspicuous locations within the business 
establishment premises to notify shopping cart users that an on-site shopping cart retention system 
is in place. Such signs shall describe how the system operates. 
(c) ?Permitted methods of retention shall include any one of the following systems or methods: 
(1) ?A physical barrier or barriers may be installed, such as bollards, which restrict shopping carts to 
the main or primary entryway to the business; 
(2) ?Shopping carts may be equipped with protruding devices, arms or similar devices, which 
operate to prohibit the cart from being removed from the interior of the business establishment; 
(3) ?A system may be used, which may be mechanical in nature, requiring a monetary deposit 
which is of a reasonable amount such that it does not deter usage of the cart but encourages 
return of the cart and allows for a refund of the deposit; or 
(4) ?A shopping cart wheel locking system may be used in conjunction with an electronic barrier 
along the perimeter of the business establishment premises; such a system causes the 
shopping cart wheels to lock when the cart approaches or crosses the barrier location by 
activating the electronic barrier. 
(d) ?Any business establishment that does not provide one of the foregoing systems or methods shall be 
afforded a period of six (6) months form the effective date of this section within which to comply. 
(e) ?The owner or operator of any business establishment who or which fails to provide and maintain an 
on-site shopping cart retention system shall be in violation of this section.

"Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence," by Kelly Holsopple, 
Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
and from "Sexually Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View," by David Sherman, presented to the 
Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000, and the Report of the 
Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 
1989, State of Minnesota), the commission finds: 
(1) ?Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide 
variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, 
prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use 
and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, pornographic litter, and 
sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2) ?Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, sometimes occur at unregulated 
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths, 
rooms, or cubicles for view films, videos, or live sexually explicit shows, which acts constitute a 
public nuisance and pose a risk to public health through the spread of sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
(3) ?The prevention of sexual contact between patrons and employees at sexually oriented 
businesses is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and serves to address the 
concerns raised in the findings contained herein. 
(4) ?Separating entertainers from patrons and prohibiting entertainers and patrons from engaging in 
sexual fondling and caressing in sexually oriented businesses would reduce the opportunity for 
prostitution transactions and thus should deter prostitution. 
(5) ?Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a 
substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating.

ARTICLE XII. - VACATION RENTALS 


Sec. 7-152. - [Generally.] 
(a) ?Authority, scope and purpose. This section is enacted under the home rule power of the City of 
Oakland Park in the interest of the health, peace, safety and general welfare. 
    This section does not prohibit vacation rentals, or the duration or frequency of vacation rentals, nor is 
it the intention of the City of Oakland Park to do so, but rather this section is intended to address life 
safety and compatibility concerns in the interests of the health, peace, safety, and general welfare. 
(b) ?Findings of facts. Based on information gleaned from the practical first-hand experience and 
observations of city commissioners, common sense deductions of city commissioners based on long 
term experiences in the City of Oakland Park, information learned by city commissioners from 
various residents, information from the U.S. Census and on the Short-Term Rental Housing 
Restrictions White Paper, prepared by Robinson & Cole, Attorneys at Law, in 2011, prepared for the 
National Association of Realtors&reg;, the city commission finds: 
(1) ?Residents residing within their residential dwellings are inherently familiar with the local 
surroundings, local weather disturbances, local hurricane evacuation plans, and means of 
egress from their residential dwellings, thereby minimizing potential risks to themselves and 
their families. 
(2) ?In contrast, transient occupants of vacation vacations, due to their transient nature, are typically 
not familiar with local surroundings, local weather disturbances, local hurricane evacuation 
plans, and means of egress from the vacation vacations in which they are staying, thereby 
increasing potential risks to themselves and their families, and putting an additional burden on, 
and potentially putting at risk, emergency personnel in the event of an emergency situation. 
(3) ?Vacation rentals, left unregulated, can create negative impacts within a residential 
neighborhood due to excessive noise, parking and traffic problems, excessive use and impact 
on public services and public works, extreme size and/or greater occupancy. 
(4) ?Vacation rentals situated within a residential neighborhood can disturb the quiet nature and 
atmosphere of the residential neighborhood, and the quiet enjoyment of its residents. 
(5) ?Vacation rentals located within established residential neighborhoods can create negative 
compatibility impacts relating to extreme noise levels, late night activities, on-street parking 
issues and traffic congestion. 
(6) ?According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the City of Oakland Park has an average household size 
of 2.35 persons. 
(7) ?According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the City of Oakland Park has an average family size of 
3.10 persons. 
(8) ?Vacation rentals situated in a single-family residential neighborhood can and do create a great 
disparity in occupancy. 
(9) ?The presence of on-site management militates against the negative impacts of vacation 
rentals. 
(c) ?Definitions. The following terms as used in this section are defined as set forth hereinafter: 
    Agent shall mean the person the owner assigns who will be responsible for ensuring compliance with 
all regulations related to vacation rentals; and will be available to respond twenty-four (24) hours per day, 
seven (7) days per week to any issue that arises relating to the vacation rental. The agent may be, but 
need not be, the property owner or tenant. The owner cannot defer responsibility of compliance to its 
agent. 
    Bedroom means any room in a vacation rental which has a bed or other place for sleeping and a 
separate closet that is an integral part of the permanent construction within the bedroom or an ensuite 
bathroom, and complies with the Florida Fire Code and Florida Life Safety Code as a bedroom, but shall 
not include a bathroom, a kitchen, a dining room, or any main living area. If a room has been added, 
altered, or converted without any required building permit having been granted, such room shall not be 
deemed a bedroom. 
    Occupant means any person who occupies a vacation rental overnight. 
    On-site management means an office located at the site of a transient public lodging establishment

present on site for purposes of supplying management, rental, and/or maintenance services for that 
particular transient public lodging establishment, and, when the office is closed, has a person who is 
available upon one-hour's phone notice to return to the transient public lodging establishment to supply 
management or maintenance services. 
    Owner occupied means the vacation rental is then occupied by person(s), at the vacation rental 
owner's consent, who do not pay rent for the occupancy of the vacation rental, when such persons are 
members of the family of the vacation rental owner. Family shall be defined as any number of individuals 
related by blood, marriage or legal adoption, and not more than four (4) persons not so related, living 
together as a single housekeeping unit. Foster children are considered part of a family. Owner occupied 
shall also mean a vacation rental occupied by the owner of the property who rents out other bedrooms 
while occupying the residence at the same time. 
    Peer-to-peer or platform entity shall mean any person, service, business, company, marketplace, or 
other entity that provides property owners, tenants and agents a platform or means to offer vacation 
rentals to occupants, whether through the internet or other means. 
    Transient public lodging establishments means any unit, group of units, dwelling, building, or group 
of buildings within a single complex of buildings which is rented to guests more than three (3) times in a

in the vacation rental shall also be deemed a vacation rental owner. The duties and functions of a 
vacation rental owner may, at the option of the vacation rental owner, be performed by an agent of the 
vacation rental owner, so long as the vacation rental owner notifies the city in writing, on a form provided 
by the city, of the identity and contact information of such agent, and the specific duties that the agent will 
be performing for the vacation rental owner. The vacation rental owner may change the designation of 
agent at any time through the filing of a new form and the payment of an administrative fee in an amount 
as set by resolution by the city commission. The vacation rental owner shall be held responsible for all 
actions of such designated agent with respect to the applicable vacation rental. 
(d) ?Enforcement. Violations of the provisions of the Code of Ordinances relative to vacation rentals 
shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of chapter 24, article XVII of the Code of 
Ordinances, and through fines in accordance with ordinances and resolutions adopted by the city 
commission. 
(d) ?Appeals. Any decision of the special master shall be final and shall be rendered in writing in 
appealable form. Such final decision may be reviewed as permitted under Florida law. 
(e) ?Construction of section. This section shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose of 
regulating vacation rentals, protecting the residential character of Oakland Park, the health, safety, 
and general welfare of its residents and visitors, and the quiet enjoyment by Oakland Park's 
residents of their residential property.

other code requirement outside this section. The registration of a vacation rental is not an approval of

grandfathered for a period of five (5) years, as to occupancy limitations, and may cap its

Oakland Park shall notify the grandfathering applicant of that fact, and the occupancy level 
that can be approved, in writing. Within twenty (20) days after such notice, an evidentiary 
hearing may be requested by the grandfather applicant before the special magistrate to 
provide the grandfathering applicant an opportunity to provide evidence and/or testimony in

registration of the vacation rental, but not later than three (3) months after adoption of the

Oakland Park in support of an application for grandfathering was intentionally false or 
fraudulent, the person supplying the false or fraudulent information shall be subject to a 
fine as set by the city commission by resolution. If there is such a determination by city 
staff, the City of Oakland Park shall notify the grandfathering applicant of that fact, and 
within twenty (20) days after such notice, an evidentiary hearing may be requested by the 
grandfathering applicant before the special magistrate to provide the grandfathering 
applicant an opportunity to provide evidence and/or testimony to show that the information 
supplied in support of the application for grandfathering was not intentionally false or 
fraudulent. The determination by the special magistrate after such evidentiary hearing shall 
be final. If no hearing is requested during that time period, the initial determination by the 
city staff shall be final. 
g. ?If a vacation rental registration does not exist as to a vacation rental for a period in excess 
of thirteen (13) months, any grandfathering determination shall be deemed abandoned, 
and shall no longer be applicable to that vacation rental.

rental agreements with prospective occupants for vacations rentals that were pre-existing as of the 
enactment of this article, (hereinafter "pre-existing agreements") are exempt from the provisions of 
this article. 
    If a vacation rental is cited for a violation of the provisions herein, (that would not be a violation if it 
were not for this section), when the vacation rental is occupied under the terms of a pre-existing 
agreement, the vacation rental owner may defend such violation based on the fact that the vacation rental 
was exempt from the Code of Ordinances due to it being occupied pursuant to a pre-existing agreement. 
Such defense shall be determined based upon the following information, and upon any additional 
information supplied by the vacation rental owner or otherwise determined by the fact finder:

agreement. 
(2) ?Copy of e-mail or other communication evidencing a binding pre-existing agreement.

    If it is reasonably determined by the city staff, and confirmed by the city's special magistrate that any 
information supplied to the City of Oakland Park in support of an application for exemption, or in support 
of a defense based upon pre-existing agreement, was intentionally false or fraudulent, the person

Sec. 8-39. - Alarm/elevator systems. 
(a) ?Declaration of intent. The intent of this section is to encourage alarm users, alarm businesses and 
elevator operators to maintain operational reliability, to promote the proper use of alarm systems and 
to reduce or eliminate dispatch requests for false alarms and elevator rescues to enhance safety 
through limiting the number of high speed responses required and to increase the availability of 
public safety personnel to address bona fide emergencies. 
This section governs systems intended to summon law enforcement or fire response, to establish 
response fees, to establish a system for the administration and to establish criteria for limited response to 
alarms. This section applies to all alarm and elevator systems incorporated into premises other than 
standalone smoke detectors not connected to a central alarm system. 
(b) ?Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows: 
    Alarm business shall mean any business operated by a person for a profit which engages in the 
activity of altering, installing, leasing, maintaining, repairing, replacing, selling, monitoring, servicing 
or responding to an alarm system, or which causes any of these activities to take place. 
    Alarm period shall mean the twelve-month period starting with and immediately preceding the 
date of a false alarm or elevator rescue. Each false alarm or elevator rescue has its own alarm 
period, starting with the date of that false alarm or elevator rescue and looking backwards for a 
twelve-month period. The function of an alarm period is to establish the number of occurrences of a 
false alarm or elevator rescue within that twelve-month period looking backwards from the false 
alarm or elevator rescue under consideration. This false alarm or elevator rescue is assigned a 
response fee reflecting the number of false alarms or elevator rescues having occurred in its alarm 
period. For example, a false alarm which is the fourth in its alarm period of the past twelve months 
will be assigned a response fee consistent with four false alarms in the past twelve (12) months. 
Police false alarms, fire false alarms and elevator rescues are separate categories which are 
aggregated separately in considering the number of incidences within an alarm period. For example, 
the first fire false alarm in a twelve-month period is treated as a first occurrence even though the 
property may have had multiple police false alarms within the prior twelve (12) months. 
    Alarm user shall mean the person(s), firm, partnership, corporation, association, organization, 
company or other entity that owns the premises on which the alarm system is maintained. 
    Elevator shall mean a hoisting and lowering mechanism, equipped with a car and platform that 
moves in guide rails and serves two (2) or more landings to transport materials or passengers or 
both. 
    Elevator rescue shall mean a response by the fire department with the intent to free individuals 
trapped within a stalled or non-functioning elevator car. Elevator rescues initiated by documented 
power failures, severe weather conditions or other force majeure incidents will not be included as 
incidents within the meaning of this section. 
    Elevator rescue alarm shall mean the activation of an elevator alarm system that indicates there 
are individuals trapped within a stalled or non-functioning elevator. 
    Elevator operator shall mean the person(s), firm, partnership, corporation, association, 
organization, company or other entity that owns the premises on which the elevator is maintained. 
    False alarm shall mean the activation of an alarm system for any reason other than an 
unauthorized entry or other crime or a fire, such as mechanical failure, malfunction, improper 
installation, or an action or omission of the owner or occupant of the property served by the activated 
alarm system. False alarms initiated by documented power failures, severe weather conditions or 
other force majeure incidents shall not be deemed as incidents within the meaning of this section. 
    Fire alarm system shall mean any mechanical or electrical device sold or installed which is 
designed for use for the detection of a fire emergency and which emits sound or transmits a signal or 
message when activated. 
    Intrusion/burglary alarm system shall mean any mechanical or electrical device sold or installed 
which is designed for use for the detection of an unauthorized entry into a building, structure, facility 
or enclosed area, or for alerting others of unauthorized entry, or any other crime and which emits 
sound or transmits a signal or message when activated. 
    Response fee shall mean those fees charged to the alarm user or elevator operator of a 
premises when the city dispatches personnel in response to a false alarm or elevator rescue signal 
from that premises. 
    Unmonitored alarm system shall mean an alarm system that emits an audio or visual alarm only 
and does not transmit a signal or message to an alarm business. 
(c) ?Response to alarm; determination of false alarm. 
(1) ?Whenever an alarm is activated in the city, thereby requiring a response to the location by the 
law enforcement department and/or the fire department, a law enforcement officer and/or fire 
official on the scene of the activated alarm system shall inspect the premises protected by the 
system and shall determine whether the City's response was due to a false alarm. 
(2) ?In making said determination, the investigating law enforcement officer or fire official shall 
presume that the alarm was a false alarm when there is no sign or physical evidence of an 
unauthorized entry or an attempted unauthorized entry and where there is no sign or physical 
evidence of a fire. For unmonitored alarm systems an alarm shall be presumed to be a false 
alarm only if an audio or visual alarm is activated upon arrival of the investigating law 
enforcement officer or fire department official. 
(3) ?All residential or commercial intrusion/burglary alarms that have a central monitor shall have a 
central monitoring verification call made to the premises generating the alarm signal, prior to 
alarm monitor personnel contacting the law enforcement department for alarm dispatch. This 
requirement excludes those alarm signals generated by silent or panic alarms. 
(4) ?Notwithstanding the requirements of (c) (1) and (2) within this section, any dispatch cancelled 
prior to the arrival of law enforcement or fire rescue personnel shall be deemed to be a false 
alarm subject to the provisions of this section. 
(d) ?Report of false alarm or elevator rescue notice. The false alarm or elevator rescue shall be 
documented by the law enforcement department and/or fire department. 
(1) ?Notice shall be provided to the alarm or elevator location address and to the property owner, if 
the property owner resides elsewhere from the location of the alarm or elevator, by first-class 
mail. This notice shall indicate the number of false alarms or elevator rescues recorded in the 
most recent twelve months, the sequence number and response fee due for the most recent 
false alarm or elevator rescue, the time and date of the response, the total amount of response 
fees remaining unpaid and the procedure for contesting the response fee. 
(e) ?False alarm and elevator rescue fees. In the event of a false alarm or elevator rescue, the alarm 
user or elevator operator shall be responsible to the city for response fees within a running twelve-
month alarm period according to the following schedule: 
(1) ?False alarms. There shall be no response fee for the first and second false alarms, fifty dollars 
($50.00) for the third false alarm and one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the fourth and 
subsequent false alarms, within a running twelve-month alarm period. In determining the 
sequence number within a twelve-month alarm period, fire alarms and security alarms shall be 
separate categories. 
(2) ?Elevator rescues. There shall be no response fee for the first and second elevator rescues 
within a building, two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for the third elevator rescue within a 
building, and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the fourth and subsequent elevator rescues 
within a building within a running twelve-month period Elevator rescue shall be a separate 
category and responses shall be tabulated by building regardless of the number of elevator cars 
operating in that building. 
(3) ?The false alarm or elevator rescue response fee shall be paid or an appeal requested within 
forty-five (45) calendar days of the incident of false alarm or elevator rescue. Failure to pay the 
fee or request an appeal fee within forty-five (45) calendar days of the incident of alarm shall 
result in prosecution of the case before a special magistrate. A penalty for failure to pay the fee 
or request an appeal within this period may be imposed and shall not exceed one hundred (100) 
percent of the unpaid response fee. A lien may be imposed on the real property where the 
violation exists and upon any real property owned by the violator. 
(f) ?Reserved. 
(g) ?Appeal of response fee. 
(1) ?An alarm user or elevator operator may appeal assessment of the response fee by filing a 
written request setting forth the reasons for the appeal within forty-five (45) calendar days of the 
false alarm or elevator rescue incident. The person submitting the appeal does not have to be 
present at the hearing for the appeal to be considered. The chief, Broward Sheriff's Office 
Oakland Park District and/or the Chief, Oakland Park Fire Rescue, or their designees, will 
initially consider all appeals. If circumstances warrant, the appeal will be approved and the 
incident will be dismissed. If the appeal remains unresolved, the appellant may submit the 
appeal to a special magistrate who shall conduct a hearing and consider the evidence 
presented. The decision of the special magistrate is final. If an alarm user or elevator operator is 
found in violation of City Code by the special magistrate and the response fee remains unpaid 
beyond the time directed for payment by the special magistrate, a penalty may be imposed not 
exceeding one hundred (100) percent of the unpaid fee. A lien may be imposed on the property 
where the violation exists and upon any real or personal property owned by the violator. 
(h) ?Liens. The special magistrate shall have the authority after a determination that a response fee has 
not been paid within the forty-five-day period or when an appeal has not been requested or after an 
appeal which has determined that a response fee is due to order that a lien be imposed on the real 
property where the violation exists and upon any real property owned by the violator and located in 
Broward County, Florida. The recordation of the notice of lien shall constitute a lien on the real 
property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal, interest, penalties, 
recordation and release of lien administrative expense, plus costs of court, if any, until final payment 
is made. The amount due shall bear interest at the legal rate beginning from the date by which 
payment has been ordered due by the special magistrate. The notice of lien, as recorded in the 
Official Records of Broward County, shall be prima facie evidence of the debt to the City of Oakland 
Park and may be foreclosed as mortgages and other liens consistent with Florida law.

Sec. 8-40. - Code enforcement administrative fees. 
    Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of the city to establish a code enforcement 
administrative fee to recover administrative costs associated with developing and presenting code 
enforcement cases before the code enforcement board/special magistrate. An administrative fee of one 
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) will be assessed on all code enforcement cases found to be in violation by 
the code enforcement board/special magistrate. Failure to pay the required code enforcement 
administrative fee shall cause this fee to be placed as a lien on the property.

to read as herein set out. Section 1 of said Ord. No. O-77-11 repealed the provisions formerly codified 
herein as §§ 9-29—9-52, which were derived from Ord. No. O-76-5, Arts. I—XXIV, (1)—(6), adopted 
March 3, 1976, and O-76-25, § 1, adopted Nov. 3, 1976. Prior to Ord. Nos. O-76-5 and O-76-25, §§ 9-

Sec. 9-29. - Name and purpose of the plan. 
    This plan shall be known as City of Oakland Park, Florida, general employees' pension plan. The 
object of the plan is to provide a monthly retirement income to eligible employees of the City of Oakland 
Park, Florida. 
    On May 1, 1963, the city adopted a pension plan and trust agreement with the then stated purpose 
of establishing the terms and conditions under which retirement, death and other benefits would be 
provided to employees of the City of Oakland Park, Florida. This plan was amended effective September 
1, 1968, to provide retirement benefits thereunder through a deposit administration group annuity 
contract. The plan was again amended on March 3, 1976, effective April 1, 1976, primarily to be 
integrated into the Code of Ordinances of the City of Oakland Park (Ordinance Nos. O-76-5 and O-76-
25), and to accomplish other minor changes. The plan is now being amended effective August 13, 1977, 
for the purpose of making minor changes in vesting rights and retirement benefits, and for clarifying the 
eligibility and benefits due to elected officials under the plan, and to accomplish other minor changes. 
    The establishment of this plan and its included trust provisions shall not be construed as giving any 
participant, or any other person, any legal right against the city, the trustee, or the corpus or income of 
this plan unless such right is specifically provided for in this agreement, nor shall it be construed as giving 
any participant the right to be retained in the service of the city. All provisions of the plan shall be applied 
to each employee of the city in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, effective September 30, 2011 the accrued benefits 
of employees who are participants in this plan on that date shall be frozen, and such participants shall 
accrue no additional benefits under this plan after that date. All such participants shall become one 
hundred (100) percent vested in their frozen accrued benefits under this plan as of September 30, 2011. 
Such participants shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefits upon separation from 
employment and attaining eligibility for normal or optional retirement in accordance with the provisions of 
the plan in effect on September 29, 2011.

(c) ?The participant's surviving parents, 
(d) ?The participant's surviving brothers and sisters, or 
(e) ?The executors or administrators of the estate of the person upon whose death the payment 
becomes payable to a beneficiary. 
    In the absence of a duly appointed guardian, any minor's share of a benefit may be paid in monthly 
installments at a rate to be determined by the board to such adult or adults who have assumed the 
custody and principal support of the minor, provided such custody has been approved by an appropriate 
court of law.

4-15-09) 


Sec. 9-40. - Small retirement income. 
    If the retirement income to which any participant becomes entitled should be less than five dollars 
($5.00) per month, the participant may be paid, in lieu of such income, a lump sum cash payment 
actuarially equivalent to such retirement income. 
    If periodic payments to any person would be less than twenty dollars ($20.00) per month, the 
fiduciary or board may pay at such intervals as will make each payment at least twenty dollars ($20.00). 
(Ord. No. O-77-11, Art. XII, 8-3-77) 


Sec. 9-41. - Nonalienation of benefits. 
(a) ?No benefits or beneficial interests provided for hereunder shall be subject in any manner to 
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge, either voluntary 
or involuntary, and any attempt to so anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or 
charge the same shall be null and void; neither shall such benefits or beneficial interests be liable for 
or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person to whom such 
benefits or funds are payable, and no such benefits or beneficial interests shall in any way be subject 
to any legal process to subject the same to the payment of any claims against such payee; except 
that it is permissible for a participant to authorize deductions from retirement benefits to provide 
premiums for group health and life insurance benefits for said participant and dependents, and 
deductions from a participant's benefit may be made in accordance with a qualified domestic 
relations order as provided in section 9-41(b), below. 
(b) ?Domestic Relations Order Exception: Effective January 1, 1985, the creation, assignment or 
recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a "Qualified 
Domestic Relations Order" as defined in the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, shall not be treated as 
an assignment or alienation prohibited as set forth in section 9-41(a) above. The plan shall establish 
reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders, in accordance 
with the rules set forth in the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 and any regulations which may be 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of Labor with regard to qualified 
domestic relations orders.

6, 7-18-07) 


Sec. 9-42. - Amendment and termination of the plan. 
(a) ?Although the city intends to continue the plan indefinitely, it reserves the right at any time to amend 
or terminate the plan. However, no such action shall cause any part of the corpus or income of the 
plan to be used for, or diverted to purposes other than, the exclusive benefit of the participants, nor 
shall any such action adversely affect the retirement income already provided under the plan. In the 
event of a merger or consolidation of services which results in employees of the plan being 
employed by the Broward Sheriff's Office, the employees so affected shall have the option of 
remaining in this plan or participating in the Florida Retirement System (FRS). In no event shall an 
employee's rights be diminished or impaired in violation of F.S. § 112.0515. 
(b) ?This plan may be amended by the city from time to time in any respect whatever by delivery to the 
trustees of a copy of the ordinance of the City Commission of Oakland Park, Florida, specifying such 
amendment and duly certified by an official of the city, subject to the following limitations: 
(1) ?Under no condition shall such amendment or amendments result in or permit the return or 
repayment to the city of any property held or acquired by the trustee hereunder, or the proceeds 
thereof, or result in or permit the distribution of any such property for the benefit of anyone other 
than employees of the city who are beneficiaries under the plan, except to the extent provided 
by section 9-52(b). 
(2) ?The city shall notify board members, in writing, of any amendments to the Ordinance which 
would affect their duties and responsibilities. 
(c) ?This plan may be terminated at any time by an ordinance of the City Commission of Oakland Park, 
Florida, duly certified by an official of the city, specifying that: 
(1) ?The plan is being terminated; or 
(2) ?Contributions hereunder are permanently discontinued; provided, however, that such 
termination shall not become effective until two (2) years after the effective date of the 
ordinance, unless an earlier termination date is specified in such ordinance. 
(d) ?This plan shall automatically terminate when no cash or other property remains in the trust fund. 
(e) ?In the event of discontinuance of the plan, the contributions made by the city will remain for the 
exclusive benefit of participants under the plan. In the event of the termination of the plan, the fund, 
to the extent sufficient therefore, shall be allocated toward providing retirement benefits herein for 
participants in the following order of precedence, based on service to the date of termination: 
(1) ?To provide retirement benefits for participants who had reached their normal retirement date 
but had not retired on the date of termination; 
(2) ?To provide retirement benefits for participants who were eligible for early retirement but had not 
retired on the date of termination of the plan; 
(3) ?To provide retirement benefits for participants who would have been eligible for retirement 
benefits if their employment had been terminated on the date of termination of the plan; 
(4) ?To provide retirement benefits for all other participants on the basis of years of service to the 
date of termination. 
If the balance remaining for allocation under any of the foregoing paragraphs is insufficient to provide in 
full the allocations under such paragraph, allocations to individual participants under such paragraph shall 
be reduced pro rata and no allocations shall be made under subsequent paragraphs. 
After all of the foregoing allocations have been made, any amounts remaining shall be returned to the 
city. 
(f) ?In the event the plan is terminated or contributions to the trust are permanently discontinued, the 
benefits of each participant in the plan on such date of termination or discontinuance are 
nonforfeitable and shall be one hundred (100) percent vested to the extent then funded.

6-21-00; Ord. No. O-2007-022, § 7, 7-18-07) 


Sec. 9-43. - General provisions. 
(a) ?Each participant entitled to benefits under the plan shall furnish to the board such evidence, data or 
information as the board considers necessary or desirable in order to properly administer the plan. 
(b) ?At the time of retirement, each retired participant will receive from the board a certificate outlining 
the amount of annuity and the conditions of payment. 
(c) ?The provisions of the contract between the board and the fiduciary shall govern with respect to the 
rights and obligations of the fiduciary, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the plan. 
(d) ?If a participant's membership in the plan is discontinued and subsequently followed by re-entry into 
the plan, such re-entry shall be on a uniform, nondiscriminatory basis, and in no event will any 
duplication of benefits result therefrom. Upon re-entry a participant who has a vested interest in the 
plan shall be additionally credited for any subsequent period of continuous service of seven (7) years 
or more. A participant shall not be credited for any period of service, either prior or subsequent to re-
entry into the plan, which is less than seven (7) continuous years. The payment of retirement 
benefits to a participant shall be suspended during any period of re-employment of the participant by 
the city. Retirement benefits shall then be calculated for the participant based upon the credited 
service at the time of retirement by the participant subsequent to the re-employment period. 
(e) ?Forfeitures arising from the termination of a participant's employment, death or for any other reason, 
shall not be used to provide additional benefits for the remaining participants but shall be used to 
reduce the next immediate contribution by the city. 
(f) ?All dividends earned on insurance and annuity contracts held hereunder shall be applied against and 
used to reduce the current or next preceding year's contributions to the plan by the city. 
(g) ?Benefits or retirement income as provided for herein shall be limited to the specific statutory 
provisions restricting defined benefit plan benefits as provided for in Internal Revenue Code section 
415 as determined applicable to the payments hereunder pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code 
and regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all increases in such 
limitations provided for under cost of living increases shall accrue to the benefit of the plan 
participants. To the extent applicable, the provisions of this plan are intended to meet the 
requirements of code section 415. If the administrator determines a conflict exists between the plan 
and code section 415, then code section 415 will supersede the plan in order to maintain qualified 
status thereof with the applicable regulatory entities with jurisdiction over this plan. 
(h) ?The plan administrator may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplication, a reasonable 
service charge or actual costs incurred for purposes of reimbursing the plan for actuarial information 
technology resources or the labor costs of the personnel providing the service that is actually 
incurred by the plan or chargeable to the plan for the clerical and supervisory assistance required to 
obtain information, benefit calculations, or other documentation or information otherwise requested 
by or required of a participant.

Sec. 9-44. - Reserved. 
Editor's note— Ord. No. O-2007-22, § 8, adopted July 18, 2007, repealed former § 9-44 in its 
entirety which pertained administration of the plan and derived from Ord. No. O-77-11, Art. 
XVI, adopted Aug. 3, 1977. 


Sec. 9-45. - Contributions to the trust fund. 
    Subject to the provisions of section 9-51 hereof, the city, on behalf of itself and its employees is 
required to deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee such amounts of cash and other property 
acceptable to the trustee as the fiduciary or an actuary (or an independent actuary engaged by the 
trustee to make such determination) deems necessary to comply with the provisions of the plan. All such 
amounts received by the trustee from the city shall constitute one (1) common fund and may be 
commingled. Unless the context clearly implies or indicates the contrary, the term "trust fund" comprises 
all property of every kind held by the trustee, from time to time, pursuant to this agreement. The trustee 
shall have no duty, express or implied, to compel any payment to be made to it by the city, or otherwise 
be responsible for the adequacy of the trust fund to meet and discharge any liabilities under the plan, and 
shall be accountable only for cash and other property actually received by it. 
(Ord. No. O-77-11, Art. XVII, 8-3-77) 


Sec. 9-46. - Payments from the trust fund. 
    Payments shall be made from the trust fund by the trustee to such persons, in such manner, at such 
times, and in such amounts as the trustee may from time to time determine in writing; provided, however, 
that the trustee may withhold compliance with or modify its payment determinations if the trustee shall 
deem such withholding or modification necessary to insure payment of the trustee's expenses or to 
protect the trustee against liability for taxes or any other liability. 
(Ord. No. O-77-11, Art. XVIII, 8-3-77) 


Sec. 9-47. - Investment of the trust fund. 
(a) ?The trust fund, except such estimated amounts as, in the opinion of the board, are required to meet 
current payments and expenses, shall be invested and reinvested by the board without distinction 
between principal and income. Subject to the provisions of this section 9-47 and paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of section 9-48, the board is authorized to: 
(1) ?Make deposits in federally insured financial institutions; and 
(2) ?Invest and reinvest the trust fund in such bonds, notes, debentures, mortgages, equipment 
trust certificates, investment trust certificates, preferred or common stock, or in such other 
property, real, personal, or mixed, either within or without the State of Florida, as it may deem 
advisable, in compliance with the standards for investment of trust funds set forth in Florida 
State Statute § 112.661. 
The board may, to the extent it deems advisable, invest in any common trust fund that qualifies 
under Section 401 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is maintained by any bank in Florida 
or in any other state of the United States. The board may hold any portion of the trust fund in 
cash pending investment or payment of expenses or benefits without liability for interest. In 
purchasing investments, the board shall endeavor to exercise the judgment and care in the 
circumstances then prevailing which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise 
in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the 
permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable 
safety of their capital. The board shall not be liable for the making, retaining or selling of any 
investment or reinvestment made by it as herein provided, or for any loss to or diminution of the 
trust fund, except such as may be due to a breach of the standards set forth herein, and for its 
own negligence, willful misconduct, or lack of good faith. 
(3) ?Invest as a participating employer in a master trust fund created for the purpose of receiving, 
holding, investing, reinvesting, managing, administering and distributing the assets of the plan 
to be held in common with other municipalities for a municipal public purpose subject to the 
supervision by the board of trustees and the provisions of this plan as to approval of any 
agreement with the trust fund by the board and the city commission. 
(b) ?Investments. 
(1) ?The board shall adopt and review annually a written investment policy, identifying the 
parameters for investment decisions, and consistently comply with its investment policy. The 
investment policy must be approved by the city commission at least annually, and any 
subsequent changes thereto must also be approved by the city commission. The previously-
approved investment policy shall remain in effect if the city commission fails to act, or 
disapproves the proposed amendment under review. The reasons for disapproval shall be set 
forth in writing and provided to the board. If the city commission disapproves a previously-
approved investment policy, the board shall resubmit a revised investment policy for approval. 
The city commission and the board shall act as soon as administratively convenient. 
(2) ?The board shall engage a firm or other entity ("investment firm") to manage the investments of 
the plan which firm shall have a background in investment management of municipal pension 
plans. The investment firm shall submit a quarterly investment report to the board within a 
maximum of sixty (60) days of the end of each quarter. The investment report shall include a 
certification that the plan investments are in compliance with the adopted investment policy; the 
investment portfolio composition; whether investment benchmarks were met; the performance 
of the plan assets in the previous quarter, for the plan year-to-date, the trailing twelve (12) 
month period, and for the previous three plan years; and other investment information that the 
board may reasonably request. 
(3) ?The board shall engage an advisor ("investment monitor") that shall have a background in: (i) 
monitoring the performance of investment firms with respect to municipal pension plan 
investments and (ii) providing advice to municipal pension boards on selection and retention of 
investment firms. The investment monitor shall submit a quarterly report ("investment report") to 
the board within forty-five (45) days of the end of each quarter. Such investment report shall 
include a written analysis of the investment firm's performance in investing the trust assets for 
the following time periods: (i) the previous quarter, (ii) the plan year to date, (iii) the trailing 
twelve (12) months; and (iv) the previous three (3) plan years. The investment report shall also 
render an opinion as to whether the investments are in compliance with the investment policy of 
the board; if the investment benchmarks were met; and provide other investment information as 
the board shall reasonably request. 
(4) ?The board shall submit the investment firm's and the investment monitor's quarterly investment 
report to the city manager within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the board or plan administrator, 
whichever receives it first. 
(c) ?The board shall keep detailed written minutes of all meetings. A copy of the minutes of such 
meetings shall be furnished to the city manager promptly after each such meeting. The board shall 
keep and maintain recordings of all meetings and make such recordings available to the city 
manager upon request. The city manager shall also have full access to all data regarding 
investments. 
(d) ?The board may enter into a contract with a life insurance company for direct disbursement of 
retirement benefits or for the purchase of retirement annuities on an individual or group basis, in 
such manner and in such form as may be deemed appropriate by the board, as provided for in the 
plan, and specifically, such retirement annuities and other benefits as may be provided for in the plan 
may be purchased under one (1) or more deposit administration type group annuity contracts.

purpose to mortgage or pledge all or any part of the trust fund; 
(8) ?To cause any investment in the trust fund to be registered in or transferred into, its name as

(b) ?In addition to the powers and authorities herein elsewhere granted, except as herein expressly 
provided otherwise, the trustee shall have the powers, authorities and discretions set forth in the 
laws of the State of Florida insofar as applicable hereto. The powers and authorities granted to the 
trustee shall not be limited by the fact that such trustee may be a bank or other financial institution, 
and no trustee duly appointed, qualified and acting hereunder shall be subject to limitations or

trustee shall be accountable solely to the trustee and shall be entitled to reasonable compensation. 
(Ord. No. O-77-11, Art. XX, 8-3-77) 


Sec. 9-49. - Administrative provisions. 
(a) ?The board shall maintain true and accurate records and accounts reflecting all receipts and 
disbursements made by it pursuant to the plan and containing a description of all assets held by it. 
Such records and accounts shall be open to the inspection of the city at all reasonable times and 
may be audited from time to time by such person or persons as the city may designate. 
(b) ?Each year, the board shall distribute to all participants of the plan an annual report ("annual report") 
which shall include highlights of the past year's activities and the prior plan year's performance of the 
trust investments. The annual report shall be distributed no later than one hundred eighty (180) days 
after the end of the plan year. 
(c) ?The board shall meet, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. A quorum of the board shall constitute a 
majority of all of the members of the board. A majority of a quorum shall approve any action by the 
board, except for the appointment and removal of an approved professional or a change in the 
investment policy, which will require at least four (4) board member votes. 
(d) ?Professional services: 
(1) ?Subject to the city commission's right to approve and remove as set forth below, the board 
shall engage the following professionals ("professional(s)"): Investment monitor, actuarial firm, 
independent auditor, and investment firm after undertaking reasonable due diligence as to the 
experience, reputation, cost and quality of the selected professionals. However, the 
engagement of any professional shall not be effective until (i) the city commission formally 
approves the engagement of each professional (an "approved professional") and (ii) the board 
and the respective professional execute a "professional service contract," as defined in this 
section (d)(4). If the city commission shall not affirmatively approve or disapprove the respective 
professional within sixty (60) days after written notification of the proposed engagement of the 
professional by the board, such engagement shall be deemed to have been approved by the 
city commission. 
(2) ?The board shall select the professionals using objective and subjective criteria related to the 
professional standards for each profession. At least once every sixty (60) months, the board 
shall select professionals through a formal selection process in which the board issues a 
request for proposals ("RFP") and duly examines, compares, and ranks the qualifications of the 
firms or persons who submit proposals meeting the requirements of the RFP. A general RFP 
request shall be sent at least thirty (30) days prior to the selection interview date that shall 
describe the duties of the position and the selection process. The board may select for interview 
any or all of RFP respondents as the board shall determine. In addition, RFPs may be 
selectively sent to specific firms or persons as the board may select, including existing approved 
professionals, in order to achieve a reasonable sample of qualified candidates for selection. 
However, if the board determines that a single entity with extensive experience providing 
investment management, investment monitoring and administrative services for municipal 
pension plans, can provide these services for a fee that is less than that of the combined fees of 
individual professionals or firms providing these services, upon a finding by the board that the 
selection has been made utilizing a process consistent with the selection of the approved 
professional using objective and subjective criteria related to the professional standards of the 
professionals as defined herein, the board may, subject to City Commission approval, select 
such entity as a professional to provide these services. Once a professional is selected by the 
board and approved by the city commission, the board may grant professional service contracts 
to such approved professionals. 
(3) ?Other than the professionals under subsection (d)(1), without approval of the city commission, 
the board may engage such persons, agents, or entities, including fiduciaries, as in its discretion 
may be required or advisable to enable it to perform custodial and investment duties hereunder; 
provided further, the board may enter into agency, investment, advisory and custodial 
agreements for the purpose of securing investment and custodianship services for the system 
and fund. 
(4) ?Each contract for the appointment of any professional by the board (a "professional service 
contract") shall be for a term of no longer than two (2) years, with a maximum of three (3) one-
year renewal options. Renewals of the professional service contracts for approved professionals 
shall require city commission approval. Each of the board's professional service contracts shall 
clearly set forth the board's and city commission'sability to terminate the approved 
professional's services pursuant to subparagraph (d)(5) and set forth performance standards 
and contract requirements under the plan. 
(5) ?The board shall retain the ability to terminate any professional service contract with or without 
cause and without approval by the city commission. The city commission shall also have the 
right to terminate any professional service contract with cause and without approval of the 
board, which termination shall supersede any action to the contrary which may be taken by the 
board. The term "with cause" shall mean: 
(i) ?A final disciplinary determination by the responsible professional or regulatory authority 
governing such professional, the suspension or revocation of the respective professional's 
license which is required to engage in the services for which the professional is engaged, 
either temporarily or permanently, and wherever situated, including revocation of an 
unrelated license by the relevant licensing authority on account of disciplinary proceedings; 
(ii) ?A material breach of any provision(s) of any contract with the board or the city, or any 
other failure to perform diligently and in good faith any provision(s) of such a contract, after 
reasonable prior notice from either the board or the city specifying the nature of the alleged

(1) ?The city commission shall appoint three (3) members ("commission appointees") who shall not 
be employees of the city. To the extent possible, commission appointees shall have some 
professional financial or professional investment experience. The current board members who 
have been appointed by the city commission shall serve in their respective capacities for the 
balance of their current terms subsequent to this amendment to section 9-50. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing sentence, any commission appointee may be removed and replaced by the city 
commission at any time, with or without cause, upon written notice to the respective commission 
appointee. 
(2) ?The general employees of the city shall elect three (3) board members ("employee

who was vested in the plan on October 1, 2007, and elected to become a member of the Florida 
Retirement Plan pursuant to section 9-31(b). The current board members who have been 
elected by the general employees shall serve out the balance of their current terms subsequent 
to this amendment to section 9-50. 
(3) ?The city's finance director or designee shall serve as the seventh board member.

(2) ?The director of financial services or designee as appointed by the city manager; and 
(3) ?The human resources director or designee as appointed by the city manager. 
(c) ?In lieu of the board serving as trustee and designating an investment firm as otherwise provided in 
this article, the board may engage an entity having (i) experience in the administration of municipal 
pension plans and (ii) trust powers within the State of Florida as trustee of the General Employees' 
Pension Plan (the "alternate trustee"). Such alternate trustee must, at a minimum, invest trust funds 
as required of the board under section 9-47 entitled "Investment of the trust fund." Such alternate 
trustee must comply with the same reporting requirements as the investment firm as provided in this 
article. The board's engagement of an alternate trustee shall not be effective until the city

to terminate any alternate trustee with or without cause and without approval by the city commission. 
The city commission shall have the right to terminate any alternate trustee with cause and without 
approval of the board, which termination shall supersede any action to the contrary that may be 
taken by the board. The term "with cause" shall have the same meaning as in subsection 9-49(d)(5).

severable and the agreement shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision or 
provisions had never been inserted herein.

legal representatives, and upon the city, the trustee and their respective successors and assigns.

a participant elects a joint annuitant option and the participant selects such option specifying the 
participant's spouse to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of the 
participant, this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit such election as a violation of this

and continuing thereafter during his lifetime with a period certain of ten (10) years. 
b. ?Amount. 
1. ?The normal retirement benefit for firefighters who terminate city employment prior to 
the effective date of this ordinance, and police officers/deputy sheriffs shall be three 
(3) percent of the member's average monthly earnings for each year of continuous 
service, subject to a maximum benefit of seventy-five (75) percent of average monthly

benefits shall recommence at the rate of two (2) percent for each year of creditable 
service. 
2. ?For firefighters who are actively employed on or after the effective date of this 
ordinance, the amount of benefit payable at normal retirement date shall be three (3) 
percent of the member's average monthly earnings for the first ten (10) years of 
continuous service, four (4) percent of average monthly earnings for the next ten (10) 
years of service, and three (3) percent of average monthly earnings thereafter; subject

the rate of two (2) percent for each year of creditable service. 
3. ?Notwithstanding any other provision of the system, effective March 1, 2013, for 
firefighters who are hired on or after March 1, 2013 and firefighters who, on March 1, 
2013, are not within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date provided in 
subsection 9-63 (a)(1)a., the amount of benefit payable at normal retirement shall be

percent of the member's average monthly earnings for each year of continuous 
service after March 1, 2013, subject to a maximum benefit of seventy (70) percent of

amount of benefit payable at normal retirement shall be as provided in subsection 9-
63 (a)(2)b.2, subject to a maximum benefit of eighty-five (85) percent of average final 
compensation. Provided, in no event shall the benefit of any member employed prior 
to March 1, 2013 be less than the member's accrued benefit percentage as of March 
1, 2013, and in no event shall the normal retirement benefit of any member be less 
than two (2) percent of the member's average monthly earnings for all years of 
continuous service. 
c. ?Cost-of-living adjustment created. A cost-of-living benefit is hereby created to be provided 
in the form of a thirteenth monthly retirement payment to each beneficiary and retiree of the 
plan. Payment shall only be made in those years in which an actuarial gain has been 
determined to exist by the board of trustees, following consultation with the actuary to the 
board. 
d. ?Determination of actuarial gains. The actuary for the retirement fund shall perform an 
annual calculation to determine on the basis of all actuarial factors used to measure the 
plan whether or not the plan has sustained an actuarial gain or loss. In any year in which 
the board of trustees, following consultation with the actuary, determines that no actuarial 
gain has occurred, no benefit shall be payable notwithstanding the availability of 
unexpended funds from a prior year. 
e. ?Creation of a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) fund. Following the determination of 
actuarial gain, a fund is hereby created, within the assets of the retirement system, which 
shall consist of one-half (½) of the value of the actuarial gain. The remaining actuarial gain 
shall be used to reduce future costs of the retirement system. The COLA fund shall be co-
mingled with other assets of the system but shall be measured for accounting purposes as 
a separate fund within the retirement system for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits 
under this section. No benefit may be paid from the COLA fund which exceeds the amount 
of annual income received by the fund. Notwithstanding the availability of funds, no benefit 
shall be paid from the fund in excess of the formula established in this subsection. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the system, no actuarial gain or portion thereof shall 
be allocated to the COLA fund on or after March 1, 2013. 
f. ?Distribution of benefits; limitations. In any year in which the board determines that a 
distribution may be made in accordance with the provisions of this section, a cost-of-living 
benefit shall be paid in the form of a thirteenth monthly pension payment to each retiree or 
beneficiary. The payment shall be equal to three (3) percent of the annual retirement 
benefit multiplied by the number of years that the employee has been retired up to a 
maximum benefit equal to fifteen (15) percent of the member's annual pension payment. In 
the event that the available funds are less than the projected liability under the formula 
established in this section, the board of trustees may, in its exclusive discretion, decline to 
make any COLA payment for that year or make a lesser COLA payment based on a pro 
rata distribution of available funds. Notwithstanding any other provision of the system, 
firefighters hired on or after March 1, 2013 and firefighters who, on March 1, 2013 are not 
within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date provided in subsection 9-63 (a)(1)a, 
shall not be eligible for the COLA benefit under this section. 
g. ?Nonguarantee of benefits. By acceptance of any cost-of-living benefit under this section, 
each retiree and beneficiary acknowledges that they have no right, title or interest in any 
such benefits except as may be determined by the board of trustees. The payment of a 
cost-of-living benefit in any year shall not create any right, title or interest in any person to 
the payment of a cost-of-living benefit in any other year. The board of trustees reserves the 
exclusive right to alter the manner of payment of the cost-of-living benefit or to decline the 
payment of such benefit in any year in which the board, in the exercise of its fiduciary 
responsibility and its sole discretion, determines it is in the best interest of the plan to 
forego such payment. 
h. ?Rule-making authority. The board of trustees shall have authority to make such uniform 
rules as it deems appropriate to facilitate the payment of benefits under this section. 
(3) ?Delayed payment. A member retiring on his normal retirement date may request, by submitting 
his written application to the board, that the commencement of his monthly normal retirement 
benefit payments be delayed until a date which is the first day of any future month, but no later 
than April 1 of the calendar year following the member's attainment of age seventy and one-half 
(70½) at which time benefit payments shall commence in accordance with the provisions of 
Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. If the commencement 
of payment of a member's monthly normal retirement benefit is delayed to a designated future 
date as provided under subsection (b) of this section, the monthly benefit payable at such future 
date shall be the amount of the member's monthly normal retirement benefit actuarially adjusted 
to reflect the member's age as of such designated date. Such adjusted monthly normal 
retirement benefit shall be payable to the member commencing as of the designated date. 
(b) ?Deferred retirement. 
(1) ?Approval and conditions for deferred retirement. A member who is eligible for normal retirement 
may elect to continue his employment with the city beyond his normal retirement date by 
submitting his written election to the board. 
(2) ?Deferred retirement benefit. The amount of monthly deferred retirement benefit payable to a 
member as of his deferred retirement date will be calculated the same as his normal retirement 
benefit as described under section 9-63(a)(2) of the system except the member's average 
monthly earnings and continuous service will be determined as of the member's deferred 
retirement date. 
(c) ?Early retirement benefits. 
(1) ?Early retirement date . 
a. ?A firefighter who, on March 1, 2013 is within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date

first day of any month following the earlier of the member's fiftieth (50th) birthday and the 
completion of ten (10) years of continuous service or twenty (20) years of continuous 
service. Effective March 1, 2013, a firefighter who is hired on or after March 1, 2013 and a 
firefighter who, on March 1, 2013 is not within seven (7) years of the normal retirement 
date provided in 9-63 (a)(1)a may retire on the first day of any month following the earlier of

month thereafter during his lifetime with a period certain of ten (10) years. The amount of

for retirement at his normal retirement date, except that continuous service and average 
monthly earnings shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or, 
b. ?Immediate early retirement benefit. An immediate monthly retirement benefit, which shall 
commence on his early retirement date and shall continue on the first day of each month 
thereafter during his lifetime with a period certain of ten (10) years. The immediate early

three (3) percent for each year that benefit commencement precedes the member's 
applicable normal retirement date. 
(d) ?Disability benefits. 
(1) ?Service-connected disability. 
a. ?Amount. Any firefighter who, on March 1, 2013 is within seven (7) years of the normal

permanently incapacitates him, physically or mentally, from regular and continuous duty 
within his department ("disability"), shall receive in equal monthly installments disability 
benefits in an amount equal to the greater of benefits payable under any other provision of 
this system to which the member may then be entitled, fifty (50) percent of the member's 
average monthly earnings in effect at the date of disability, or the accrued benefit at the 
date of disability (payable as a ten-year certain and life benefit), or forty-two (42) percent of 
average monthly earnings (payable as a ten-year certain and life benefit) on the date of 
disability. It is the intent of this provision that a service-connected disability benefit be tax 
exempt under the provisions of section 104 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any firefighter 
member who, on March 1, 2013 is not within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date 
provided in 9-63 (a)(1)a, and any firefighter hired on or after that date, who incurs a 
service-connected injury, disease or disability, which injury, disease or disability

within his department ("disability"), shall receive disability benefits in accordance with the 
provisions of section 175.191, Florida Statutes. 
b. ?Normal form of disability benefit. Unless a member elects otherwise, the normal form of 
disability benefit payable hereunder shall be an annuity payable for life with ten (10) years 
certain which shall be actuarially equivalent to an annuity payable for life based upon the 
foregoing percentages of average monthly earnings. A member may designate a 
beneficiary for any disability benefits which are payable subsequent to his death, if any. If 
none shall have been designated, such payments shall be made to his surviving spouse, if 
any; if none, then to his surviving children in equal shares; if none, then to his estate. 
(2) ?Non-service-connected disability. 
a. ?Ten (10) or more years of continuous service. Any firefighter member who, on March 1, 
2013 is not within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date provided in subsection 9-
63 (a)(1)a, has completed at least ten (10) years of continuous service and receives a non-
service-connected injury, disease or disability, which permanently incapacitates him 
physically or mentally from employment within his department, shall receive disability 
benefits in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 175.191. Any firefighter member who, 
on March 1, 2013 is within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date provided in 
subsection 9-63 (a)(1)a, or any police officer/deputy sheriff member, who has completed at 
least ten (10) years of continuous service and receives a non-service-connected injury, 
disease or disability, which permanently incapacitates him physically or mentally from 
employment with the police or fire department, shall receive the greater of: 
1. ?Benefits payable under any other provision of the system to which the member may 
then be entitled; 
2. ?Equal monthly installments in an amount equal to twenty-five (25) percent of his 
average monthly earnings as in effect at the date of disability; or 
3. ?The accrued benefit payable on the date of disability.

(3) ?Determination of disability. All issues and determinations relating to eligibility for initial payment 
or continuance of disability benefits shall be determined by the board, taking into consideration 
the recommendations of the medical board, and based upon the methods and procedures 
established by the board. The determination by the board shall be conclusive as to all issues 
pertaining to disability. All such determinations will be applied uniformly and consistently to all 
members in similar circumstances. 
(4) ?Reduction for other disability benefits. The benefit provided in this section may not be offset by 
Social Security, worker's compensation, city-provided disability insurance as permitted by law. 
(5) ?Benefits payable at and after normal retirement date. 
a. ?Service-connected disability. A member who had previously become disabled due to a 
service-connected disability and who has reached his normal retirement date shall be 
entitled to receive a benefit which is the same as his monthly normal retirement benefit 
determined as of his normal retirement date, but based on the member's earnings as of his 
date of disability and his continuous service which shall include service for the period of his 
disability. 
b. ?Non-service-connected disability. A member who had become disabled due to a non-
service-connected disability and who has reached his normal retirement date shall 
continue to receive the same non-service-connected disability benefit which he was 
receiving prior to his normal retirement date, payable during his remaining lifetime. 
(6) ?Credited service while disabled. A disabled member's period of service-connected disability 
shall be credited to him as continuous service upon his recovery provided he immediately 
returns thereafter as an actively employed employee. 
(7) ?No duplication of benefits. Except to the extent that an employee will receive service credit for 
time spent on disability, if the employee resumes active service prior to normal retirement age, 
as expressly provided in this subsection 9-63(d), there shall be no duplication of benefits upon 
the subsequent death of a member after disability benefits commence. Disability benefits shall

death on behalf of any member who, prior to the commencement of termination, disability or 
early, normal or deferred retirement benefit payments under this system, dies as a direct result 
of service-connected death. Except as provided in subsection (e)(3) of this section 9-63, such 
death benefit shall be payable as follows but for a member with ten or more years of service, it 
shall not be less than the amount of the member's accrued benefit payable for ten years certain 
and life at the member's normal retirement date or reduced for early payment: 
a. ?If spouse. If there shall be a surviving spouse at the time of the member's death, there shall 
be paid to such spouse until said spouse's death, a death benefit payable in equal monthly 
installments, in an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the member's average monthly 
earnings as in effect as of the date of the member's death with ten (10) years certain; or 
b. ?No spouse. If there shall be no surviving spouse at the time of the member's death, there

same amount for each unmarried child from age eighteen (18) until age twenty-two (22) 
who is a full time student in a fully accredited high school, college or university. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total death benefit payable pursuant to this subsection 
shall be subject to an overall family limitation of fifty (50) percent of such member's 
average monthly earnings as in effect as of the date of such member's death for all such 
children combined. In that event, each such child's portion of the death benefit shall be

member until such child shall have reached the age of eighteen (18) years, and a same 
amount for each unmarried child from age eighteen (18) until age twenty-two (22) who is a 
full time student in a fully accredited high school, college or university. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the total death benefit payable pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to an 
overall family limitation of twenty-five (25) percent of such member's average monthly

but after completing ten (10) years of continuous service, his or her beneficiary shall only be 
entitled to the benefits otherwise payable to the firefighter at early or normal retirement age. 
(4) ?No optional form of benefits available. Payment of pre-retirement death benefits hereunder 
shall be in lieu of any other form of benefit payment otherwise available pursuant to the system; 
no optional benefit shall be available for any pre-retirement death benefit. 
(f) ?Termination benefits and vesting. If a member ceases to be an employee as defined in this chapter,

soon as reasonably possible subsequent to termination of employment. 
(2) ?With five (5) years or more of continuous service: 
a. ?If no member contributions are withdrawn. The benefit accrued under this system to such 
member's date of termination, payable commencing at what would otherwise be his normal 
retirement date, and in the form of a life annuity or other actuarially equivalent optional 
benefit commencing at his normal or early retirement date, respectively, but based upon 
the following vesting schedules:

10 or more 
100% 
 
2. ?Firefighters . Effective March 1, 2013, firefighters shall become 100 percent vested in 
their accrued benefit upon attaining ten (10) years of continuous service; provided that 
firefighters hired prior to March 1, 2013 with at least five (5) years of continuous 
service on March 1, 2013, shall retain their vested status as of that date. Any 
firefighter partially vested prior to March 1, 2013, must complete ten (10) years of 
continuous service to become 100% vested in their accrued benefit. There shall be no 
partial vesting for any firefighter hired on or after March 1, 2013 or any firefighter with 
less than five (5) years of continuous service on that date. 
3. ?Payment of benefits. The payment of any benefits to a firefighter or police officer prior 
to attainment of what would have been his normal retirement age shall be reduced by 
the early retirement factors in subsection 9-63(c)(2)b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
a member shall die after termination of employment but prior to the commencement of 
benefits at normal or early retirement age, respectively, the member's designated 
beneficiary shall receive a refund of the member's contributions plus interest (as 
defined in section 9-61 of this system) payable at such time as the beneficiary so 
elects on a form prescribed by the board. In the absence of a written notification of 
beneficiary, the member's estate shall be considered the designated beneficiary. The 
refund shall be made as soon as reasonably possible subsequent to the receipt of a 
request for benefits. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, if a member has 
reached the maximum accrued benefit under the plan, the member shall be deemed 
one hundred (100) percent vested regardless of the number of years of service and 
membership in the plan shall cease. If a member remains employed, after plan 
membership has ceased and becomes disabled in the line of duty, the member shall 
be entitled to the disability benefits provided for in this plan or the accrued benefit, 
whichever shall be greater. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, if on July 
5, 1995, any member has accrued benefits in excess of seventy-five (75) percent, the 
member shall be deemed one hundred (100) percent vested in the benefits accrued 
based on the formula in effect at the time of accrual of the benefits. In the case of 
such an event, membership in the plan shall cease and no further benefits may be 
accrued. If the member remains employed by the city and becomes disabled in the 
line of duty, the member shall be eligible for the disability benefits provided for under 
this plan, or the accrued benefit, whichever shall be greater. 
b. ?If member contributions are withdrawn. A refund of such member's contributions plus 
interest (as defined in section 9-61 of this system) payable at such time as the member so 
elects. No optional form of benefit shall be available hereunder. Such refund shall be made 
as soon as reasonably possible subsequent to termination of employment. A refund of 
contributions of a firefighter hired on or after March 1, 2013, or a firefighter with less than 
ten (10) years of continuous service as of March 1, 2013, shall not include interest. 
(3) ?Transfer of certain members. Any member of this system who ceases to be an employee as 
defined in this chapter but who remains with the city or county in some other capacity or who, 
prior to membership in this system had city or county service resulting in an aggregate total of 
five (5) or more years of continuous employment with the city or county shall have all benefits 
accrued under this system preserved, provided the member does not withdraw the accumulated 
employee contributions. Any accrued benefit shall be payable at the normal retirement date set 
forth in this system. No benefit shall be payable under the system, however, during any period 
of continued employment with the city or county in any capacity, unless the employee has 
retired from the system or transferred to the Florida Retirement System (FRS). 
(g) ?Return of member contributions. The present value of any benefit provided by this section, whether 
or not service-connected, shall, except as provided herein, be at least equal to the amount of the 
member's individual contributions to the system plus interest (as defined in section 9-61 of this 
system). The payment of any other form of benefit pursuant to this section shall be in lieu of a refund 
of the said member's contributions under this subsection. Effective March 1, 2013, the present value 
of the benefit of a firefighter hired on or after March 1, 2013, or a firefighter with less than ten (10) 
years of continuous service on March 1, 2013 shall be at least equal to the member's individual 
contributions to the system without interest. 
(h) ?Overall limitations on amount of benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and in addition 
to any other limitations set forth in the system, a member's benefit under this system, including the 
right to any optional benefit provided by the system, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of 
the amount of such member's "compensation" as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 415 
(1986), and Treasury Regulation 1.415-2(d) which are hereby specifically incorporated by reference 
as part of the system.

hereby created for eligible members as defined in this subsection. 
(2) ?Eligible members for participation in the early retirement incentive shall have completed twenty 
(20) years of service and shall have attained age forty-seven (47) as of December 31, 1995. 
(3) ?Each year purchased, service and/or age, shall be at the rate of eight and one-half (8½) 
percent of the member's base and longevity pay. When a member requires a combination of 
years of age and years of service, the amount purchased shall be the greater of service or age 
required to meet maximum retirement requirements. In effect, a year of service and a year of 
age shall be counted as one (1) year as calculated currently in subsection 9-65(a). The payment 
to the city shall be eight and one-half (8½) percent of member's base and longevity pay per 
year, multiplied by the total number of years purchased. Payment shall be made to the city prior 
to retirement. 
a. ?Notwithstanding the above provision, nothing in this section shall allow a member to 
increase his or her retirement benefits above the following: 
1. ?Age fifty-three (53): Normal retirement age without any penalty or actuarial reduction. 
2. ?Maximum pension benefit or seventy-five (75) percent unless eligible for a higher 
percentage as provided in subsection (f)(2), above. 
(4) ?Members retiring under this subsection (i) shall not be subject to any early retirement penalty or 
actuarial reduction but shall be treated as normal retirement. 
(5) ?Members that meet the minimum eligibility requirements of this subsection (i) shall submit a 
written request (on a form provided by the city) to apply for purchase of years of service or age 
or both under subsection (i)(3), above. Each member satisfying the minimum eligibility 
requirements shall submit the written request to the city clerk within sixteen (16) calendar days 
from the date of final adoption of this subsection (i) by the city commission. The failure to submit 
the proper written request to the city clerk by 5:00 p.m. on the sixteenth day subsequent to the 
final adoption of this subsection (i) (March 20, 1996) shall forever preclude the applicant from 
applying for early retirement incentive under this subsection. 
(6) ?The city manager, police chief, fire chief and the pension board administrator shall: 
a. ?Review all requests received by the city clerk on a timely basis and in proper form for 
purposes of ensuring that all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. All requests 
determined not to satisfy the requirements of this subsection (i) shall be rejected and the 
member/employee shall not be eligible for early retirement incentive. 
b. ?Develop and publish a tentative schedule of retirements based on the number of 
applications and based on the staffing needs of the police and fire departments. 
c. ?Post the tentative schedule and meet individually and/or collectively with the applicants for 
discussion and input. 
d. ?Revise tentative retirement schedule based on the police department, fire department and 
applicant's needs. The city manager, in his sole and exclusive discretion, shall make the 
final retirement schedule. In no instance will the retirement schedule extend more than six 
(6) months from the date of the final adoption of this subsection (i) (March 20, 1996). 
e. ?Publish the final schedule and officially notify the pension board for their action and 
administrative processing. 
(7) ?Effective upon March 20, 1996, and for the period of sixteen (16) days thereafter (the 
retirement election window), a participant with at least twenty (20) years of service as of 
December 31, 1995, and who meets all other eligibility requirements, may elect to retire during 
the early retirement election window and shall accrue benefits, not to exceed the maximum 
allowed under this system, according to the uniform formula established. The uniform formula 
for determining final benefit shall be the number of years of service worked multiplied by an 
accrual benefit factor. The accrual benefit factor shall be defined as a maximum benefit level 
divided by actual years or part thereof of credited service. For purposes of this section, 
maximum benefit level is defined in subsection (a)(2)b., above, as seventy-five (75) percent of 
average monthly earnings. In the case of William Gagliardo, the maximum benefit level shall be 
defined as eighty-two and one-quarter (82¼) percent of average monthly earnings. In the case 
of William Schiffman Jr., the maximum benefit level shall be defined as seventy-nine and one-
half (79½) percent of average monthly earnings. No member participating in the retirement 
election window shall receive a benefit less than the minimum as prescribed by F.S. 175.351 
and F.S. 185.35. 
(j) ?Participation in the Florida Retirement System. Effective September 1, 2018, or as soon thereafter as 
administratively feasible, the city shall join the Florida Retirement System (FRS) for firefighters, and 
this system shall be closed to new members. Firefighters hired on or after the date the city joins FRS 
shall become compulsory members of the Florida Retirement System and shall not be eligible for 
membership in this system. Firefighters hired before the date the city joins FRS who are contributing 
members of this system on the date the city joins FRS may elect to participate in FRS or continue 
participating in this system, in accordance with FRS statutes and rules. The member contributions 
and accrued benefits of contributing firefighter members who are employed on the date the city joins 
FRS and elect to join the Florida Retirement System shall be handled as follows: 
(1) ?Members with less than five (5) years of credited service in this system on the date the city 
joins FRS shall receive a refund of their member contributions without interest, or the value of 
their accrued benefit if greater, and shall not receive any other benefits from this system. Such 
members may roll over the refund of member contributions to purchase service credit under the 
Florida Retirement System in accordance with FRS statutes and rules. 
(2) ?Members with five (5) or more years of credited service in this system on the date the city joins 
FRS may elect to receive a refund of their member contributions without interest, or the value of 
their accrued benefit if greater, and following such election shall not receive any other benefits 
from this system. Such members may roll over the refund of member contributions to purchase 
service credit under the Florida Retirement System in accordance with FRS statutes and rules. 
Alternatively, such members may elect to keep their contributions in this system and receive 
their vested accrued benefit upon termination of employment on or after the early or normal 
retirement date. The benefit payable from this system shall be based on the member's credited 
service and average final compensation at the time the member joins FRS. 
(3) ?Notwithstanding any other provision of this system, firefighter members who were employed 
but not within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date on March 1, 2013 and elect to join 
FRS on the date the city joins FRS: 
a. ?Shall receive a 3.0 percent benefit multiplier for each year of credited service from March 1, 
2013 through the day before the date the city joins FRS. 
b. ?Shall be eligible to participate in the deferred retirement option plan (DROP) in accordance 
with section 9-70, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, upon reaching age fifty-
five (55) with ten (10) or more years of credited service, or age fifty-two (52) with twenty-
frive (25) or more years of credited service. Such members who enter the DROP shall 
receive a monthly payment into their DROP account equal to their monthly pension benefit 
based on average monthly earnings and years of credited service on the date they join 
FRS. The maximum DROP participation period for such members shall be eight (8) years 
or until the member attains age sixty (60), whichever occurs first. 
c. ?Alternatively, such members who do not participate in the DROP shall be eligible to receive 
an in-service distribution upon reaching age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more years of 
credited service, or age fifty-two (52) with twenty-five (25) or more years of credited 
service, and retirement from the system and separation from city employment. The in-
service distribution shall be equal to the monthly pension benefit based on average 
monthly earnings and years of credited service on the date the member joins FRS. For the 
purpose of this paragraph, "separation from city employment" means a termination of all 
city employment for a period of one business day. The in-service distribution provided in 
this paragraph shall be payable for a maximum of eight (8) years or until the member 
attains age sixty (60), whichever occurs first. 
d. ?Members who retire from the system and are subsequently reemployed in accordance with 
paragraph c. above shall upon reemployment be compulsory members of the Florida 
Retirement System.

Sec. 9-64. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a) ?General rule. A member entitled to an early, normal or deferred retirement shall have the right to 
elect to have benefits payable under the optional benefits set forth in this section. The option chosen 
may be changed by the member until the issuance of the first retirement check. Thereafter, the 
election of an option is irrevocable. The present value of a member's option shall be the actuarial 
equivalent of all other options available to that member. A member shall make an election of option 
by written request to the board made at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of benefits. 
The request shall be retained in the board's files. 
(b) ?Optional forms of benefits. The normal form of retirement is the ten (10) years certain and life 
thereafter. In addition, the following optional forms are available: 
(1) ?Joint and last survivor option . A disabled or retiring member may elect to receive a decreased 
retirement monthly benefit during his lifetime and have such decreased monthly benefit (or a 
designated fraction thereof) continued after his death to and during the lifetime of the spouse or 
other designated beneficiary, so long as the present value of the monthly payments to the 
spouse and beneficiaries shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the value of the monthly 
payments to the member and his spouse and/or beneficiary. The election of this optional benefit 
shall automatically become null and void if the spouse or other designated beneficiary dies 
before the member's actual commencement of the member's joint and last survivor benefit 
hereunder. 
(2) ?Life annuity option. Prior to commencement of benefits hereunder, a member may elect to 
receive a monthly benefit with monthly payments payable for his lifetime only. No further 
benefits shall be payable to such member's spouse or beneficiary subsequent to such 
member's death pursuant to this option. The election of this optional benefit shall automatically 
become null and void if the member dies before the member's actual commencement of the 
member's life annuity benefit hereunder.

Sec. 9-65. - Contributions to the trust fund. 
(a) ?Member contributions. The member contribution for firefighters who terminate city employment prior 
to the effective date of this ordinance, and police officers/deputy sheriffs, shall be eight and one-half 
(8½) percent of basic wages and longevity. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, the member 
contribution rate for firefighters shall be ten (10) percent of basic wages and longevity. The city shall 
pick up rather than deduct member contributions. Any contributions so picked up shall be considered 
as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. Any amount 
so picked up shall be considered as employee contributions for the purposes of state law. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the system, effective March 1, 2013, the member 
contributions for firefighters who are hired on or after March 1, 2013 and firefighters who, on March 
1, 2013, are not within 7 years of the normal retirement date provided in sec. 9-63 (a)(1)a, shall be 
eight percent (8%) of basic wages and longevity. The member contributions for firefighters who, on 
March 1, 2013 are within seven (7) years of the normal retirement date provided in section 9-63 
(a)(1)a shall be ten percent (10%) of basic wages and longevity. 
(b) ?State, county and city contributions. 
(1) ?State contributions. Any monies previously received or receivable by reason of laws of the 
State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police 
officers and firefighters of the city shall, no more than five (5) days after receipt, be deposited in 
the fund comprising part of this system, and no benefits shall be payable as arising from such 
funds except as provided in this article. All premium tax revenues received pursuant to F.S. ch. 
175, shall be used to reduce the city's required contributions to the system. 
(2) ?County contributions. The county shall contribute to this system, in accordance with the city 
county fire service agreement as defined in this chapter, on behalf of those county employees 
who are members of this system, the same amount it would have contributed to the Florida 
Retirement System had said employees not elected to remain as active members of this 
system, which amount shall be promptly deposited into this system. A portion of the county 
contribution shall be regarded as a member contribution, as provided in subsection (a), above. 
(3) ?City contributions. Subject to the provisions of subsection (a), above, the city shall make 
quarterly contributions to the trust fund in the amount that would soundly fund the system. 
(c) ?Miscellaneous provisions . All monies which have been funded by the member's, county's and city's 
contributions, and monies from all outside sources such as private contributions or those 
contributions made by the State of Florida or any other firms or corporations or companies, invested 
into any basic or secondary pension plan, including the system fund, for the retirement of any 
employee who shall be included in this system, including any interest gathered by these monies, 
shall be transferred into this fund to be known as "the Oakland Park Police and Firefighters 
Retirement Fund." 
(d) ?Forfeitures . To the extent that it is not required for the funding of any vested or retirement benefits, 
monies remaining in the fund which had previously been contributed in order to fund such benefits 
for terminated members shall serve only to reduce current and future contributions under this 
system.

office until a successor is appointed or elected. 
(c) ?Election procedure. The election of the police and firefighter and member trustees shall be by 
majority vote of all active members of each of said respective departments, who come within the 
purview of this article under procedures, and at meetings to be held as designated by the city 
manager of which meetings all qualified members entitled to vote shall be notified in person or by 
mail ten (10) days in advance of said meeting. Members employed by the county shall vote by mail 
ballots under procedures designated by the city manager. The candidate receiving the highest 
number of votes for each office shall be declared elected and shall take office immediately upon 
commencement of the term of office for which elected or as soon thereafter as he shall qualify 
therefor. An election shall be held not more than thirty (30) days and not less than ten (10) days prior 
to the commencement of the terms for which trustees are to be elected. The board shall meet, 
organize, and by majority vote elect one (1) of their members as chairman, one (1) member as vice-
chairman, and one (1) member as secretary each year, within ten (10) days after trustees are 
elected and duly qualified. 
Effective October 1, 2002 the active police officer seat may be held by either an active deputy sheriff who 
is a member of the plan or a retired police officer or deputy sheriff who shall be elected by the active 
deputy sheriffs who are members of the plan. Whenever the active membership of deputy sheriffs shall 
fall below ten (10), the active police officer seat may be held by either an active deputy sheriff or a retired 
police officer or deputy sheriff who is a member of the plan and who shall be elected by the retirees and 
active deputy sheriff membership of the plan. If there are no active or retired members remaining in the 
plan or capable of serving, the remaining board members may elect an individual to serve in the active

(f) ?Duties and oath. Each trustee shall, within ten (10) days after his appointment or election, take an 
oath of office before the city clerk of the city that so far as it develops upon him, he will diligently and 
honestly administer the affairs of the said board, and that he will not knowingly violate, or willingly 
permit to be violated, any of the provisions of the law applicable to the retirement system. Such oath 
shall be subscribed to by the members making it, certified by said clerk, and filed in the office of said 
clerk. 
(g) ?Voting. Each trustee shall be entitled to one (1) vote on the board. Three (3) affirmative votes shall 
be necessary for a decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. The chairman shall have the 
right to one (1) vote only. 
(h) ?Ability to promulgate rules and regulations. Subject to the limitations of this article, the board shall

not a board member, who shall prepare agendas, minutes, computations, motions and other required 
documentation for the board. If the board administrator is a city employee, the time that may be 
allocated to board matters shall be at a reasonable level. If the time required by the board for the 
administrator to complete board matters becomes excessive, then it shall be the decision of the city 
manager to seek appropriate remedy with either the trustee or the city commission. One of the 
appropriate remedies may be that the fund shall reimburse the general fund for the excessive 
employee time. The board shall be authorized to pay the attorney and the board administrator a 
reasonable compensation from the trust fund.

vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the 
disbursing agent on authorization from the board. 
(c) ?Administration of the fund. The board shall institute, maintain, or defend any litigation required for 
the preservation of the trust fund or in connection with the administration of the trust fund. The fund

wherever situated, as it shall deem advisable, including, but not limited to, insurance company 
investment contracts, stocks (common or preferred), bonds and mortgages, and other 
evidences of indebtedness or ownership, although the same may not be of the character 
permitted for trustees' investment by the laws of the State of Florida. The board shall be vested 
with full legal title to said fund subject, however, and in any event, to the authority and power of 
the city commission to amend or terminate this trust; provided, that no amendment or fund 
termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund for any purpose except for the 
payment of regular expenses, benefits and purposes as set forth in this system. The income 
thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the 
board or its agent in the fund, and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest 
separately any portion of the fund. 
(2) ?The board may retain in cash or unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may 
deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(3) ?Neither the board nor any person or entity shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of

with the trustee, or with depositories designated thereby, or amortize or fail to amortize any part 
or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and 
generally, to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds or other 
investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to 
exercise. 
(6) ?The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to 
secure any order of court for the exercise of any power herein contained. 
(7) ?Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required 
to perform, either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee 
under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, 
the city or any other entity of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the 
board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until 
such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it.

actuarial studies for the system and consult with the system's actuary to make sure that the 
funding of the plan, including the sufficiency of the payments being made to the fund by the city, 
is being maintained on an actuarially sound basis. The board shall be entitled to rely 
conclusively upon all reports, opinions, tables, valuations and computations furnished by the 
actuary for this purpose. 
(10) ?In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the city and the board shall be 
necessary parties, and neither the county, any member or other person having an interest in the 
fund shall be entitled to any notice of service or process. Any judgment entered in such a 
proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(f) ?Board may employ agents. Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be 
performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all 
times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent and provided further that 
legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(g) ?Administrative changes. No change in any of the operating rules of the system shall be made 
without the approval of a majority of the board. 
(h) ?Investment guidelines. With regard to the investment of the fund in stocks, bonds, mortgages and

(a) ?Amendment . The city commission shall have the right at any time to modify, alter or amend the 
system in whole or in part; provided, however, that the city shall not have the power to amend the 
system in such manner as to cause or permit any portion of the fund held for members under the 
system to be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of such members and their 
beneficiaries, or to reduce any benefits or amounts already vested in the members according to the 
provisions hereof, and provided further, that no such amendment shall have the effect of revesting in 
the city any portion of the fund, except such amount as may, due to an erroneous actuarial 
computation, remain in the fund after the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system. In the event of 
a merger or consolidation of services which results in members of the system being employed by the 
Broward Sheriff's Office, the employees so affected shall have the option of remaining in this plan or

diminished or impaired in violation of F.S. § 112.0515. 
(b) ?Termination. The city reserves the right to terminate the system and its contributions thereunder at 
any time, the termination to be effective at the close of business on a date to be designated by the 
city. If the city terminates the system, or if it is otherwise terminated or contributions to it completely 
discontinued, the board shall continue to administer the fund in accordance with the provisions 
hereof, such that the benefits of each member on such date of termination or discontinuance are 
nonforfeitable and shall be one hundred (100) percent vested to the extent then funded. Upon 
termination of the plan, preference in the distribution of assets shall first be given to retired members 
and their beneficiaries; then to fulfilling obligations to vested members, whether or not in service, 
then to the return of contributions of nonvested members and then to the payment of any 
administrative obligations of the plan. Following the payment to the last living member of the plan 
and satisfaction of all other debts and obligations of the plan, any assets remaining shall revert to the 
city and to the state in the same proportion as their contributions were made to the plan. The police 
plan shall remain in effect until the final benefit payment has been made to the last participant or 
beneficiary and shall then be terminated in accordance with F.S. § 185.37.

(Ord. No. O-2001-001, § 1, 1-3-01; Ord. No. O-2007-019, § 3, 6-20-07; Ord. No. O-2013-004, § 
4, 2-20-13) 


Sec. 9-71. - Firefighter share plan. 
(a) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of Section 37.4 of the 2007 
collective bargaining agreement between the City and Metro Broward Professional Firefighters Local 
3080, and to provide a mechanism to pay required "extra benefits" to firefighters, pursuant to 
Chapter 175, Florida Statutes. The fund created by this Section, hereinafter the Oakland Park 
Firefighter Share Plan, shall be derived exclusively from Chapter 175 premium tax revenues 
received from the state prior to March 1, 2013, and not from any additional employer contributions by 
the City, and shall be in addition to the firefighter defined benefit pension paid by the Oakland Park 
Police, Firefighters and Public Safety Officers Retirement System. The Oakland Park Firefighter 
Share Plan shall be administered by the Board of Trustees of the Oakland Park Police, Firefighters 
and Public Safety Officers Retirement System. 
(b) ?Available funds. The funds to be deposited in the share plan each year shall be designated as 
"available funds" for the purpose of this section, and shall be determined as set forth in this 
subsection. "Available funds" are those premium tax revenues received after the effective date of this 
ordinance [Ord. No. 2007-019] pursuant to Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, that are in excess of the 
maximum annual amount allowed by law to be applied toward the cost of the pension plan prior to 
the effective date of this ordinance plus the maximum annual amount allowed by law to be applied 
toward the cost of benefit enhancements provided in sections 1 and 3 of this ordinance [Ord. No. 
2007-019]. Each year prior to March 1, 2013, after receipt of the annual distribution of Chapter 175 
premium tax revenues from the state, the board of trustees, with the advice of its actuary, shall 
provide to the city a preliminary calculation of the available funds, if any, for deposit into the share 
plan. Within thirty (30) days of receipt by the city of the preliminary calculation and any requested 
supporting information, the city, at the city's expense, may have the preliminary calculation reviewed 
by an independent actuary selected by the city. If the city does not have the preliminary calculation 
reviewed by an independent actuary, or does not notify the board within thirty (30) days following 
receipt of the preliminary calculation and any requested supporting information that the city actuary 
disagrees with the preliminary calculation, the preliminary calculation shall become final. If the plan 
actuary and city actuary cannot agree on the amount of available funds, a third actuary selected by 
mutual agreement of the other two actuaries shall review and discuss the two (2) actuaries' positions 
and submit and discuss the reports with the board. The cost of the third actuary shall be borne by the 
city. No later than March 15 of every year, the board shall consider all the actuaries' reports and take 
the most appropriate, reasonable and prudent final action. All actuarial assumptions, cost methods 
and procedures used in determining the amount of available funds shall be the same as those used 
in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, 
no premium tax revenues received after March 1, 2013 shall be deposited into the share plan. 
(c) ?Share accounts. An individual share account shall be established for each firefighter who is actively 
employed on the effective date of this ordinance, including DROP participants, and for firefighters 
who are hired by at any time after such date, but prior to March 1, 2013, hereinafter "share plan 
participants." Share account balances shall be invested by the board of trustees and may be 
commingled for investment purposes with the other assets of the retirement system. Separate 
accounting shall be maintained for all commingled assets. At the end of each quarter, each 
participant's share account balance will be credited or debited with the same overall rate of return, 
net of all fees and investment related costs, earned by all other assets of the retirement system 
during that quarter, which may include investment losses, depending on the overall rate of return of 
the system. Firefighters hired on or after March 1, 2013 shall not be eligible to participate in the 
share plan. 
(d) ?Allocation of shares. On or before March 30 each year, the available funds determined as of 
September 30 of the preceding year shall be equally distributed to share plan participants who 
qualify by virtue of their being active firefighters, who were on the payroll on September 30 of the 
preceding year. Available funds shall be equally divided between each share plan participant and 
credited to the share plan participant's individual account. 
(e) ?Distributions. The account balance for each share plan participant shall be payable within ninety 
(90) days after separation from service, or on such other date as is deemed feasible by the board of 
trustees. 
(f) ?Vesting. No share plan participant shall be entitled to payment of a share account balance unless: i) 
the share plan participant has completed ten (10) years of credited service under the Oakland Park 
Police, Firefighters and Public Safety Officers Retirement System as a firefighter, and ii) the share 
plan participant becomes eligible for a normal, early, disability, or death benefit from the Oakland 
Park Police, Firefighters and Public Safety Officers Retirement System. In the event of the death of a 
share plan participant prior to the payment of share plan balances, the accumulated share plan 
balance shall be paid to the share participant's designated beneficiary. Upon the separation from 
service of a non-vested share plan participant, the share account balance attributable to the non-
vested participant shall revert back into the Share Plan and shall be reallocated unless the former 
share plan participant returns to city service as a firefighter prior to the end of the plan year in which 
the separation occurred.

Sec. 9-72. - Available [F.S.] Ch. 185 premium tax revenues, ad-hoc COLA and deputy sheriff share plan. 
(a) ?"Available Chapter 185 Premium Tax Revenues" are those premium tax revenues received 
pursuant to F.S. § 185.35(1), that are in excess of the maximum annual amount allowed by law to be 
applied toward the cost of the pension plan. Each year, after receipt of the annual distribution of 
[F.S.] Ch. 185 premium tax revenues from the state, the board of trustees, with the advice of its 
actuary, shall provide to the city a preliminary calculation of the available premium tax revenues, if 
any, for allocation to ad-hoc COLA benefits and to the share plan. Within sixty (60) days of receipt by 
the city of the preliminary calculation and any requested supporting information, the city, at the city's 
expense, may have the preliminary calculation reviewed by an independent actuary selected by the 
city. If the city does not have the preliminary calculation reviewed by an independent actuary, or 
does not notify the board within sixty (60) days following receipt of the preliminary calculation and 
any requested supporting information that the city actuary disagrees with the preliminary calculation, 
the preliminary calculation shall become final. If the plan actuary and city actuary cannot agree on 
the amount of available premium tax revenues, a third actuary selected by mutual agreement of the 
other two (2) actuaries shall review and discuss the two (2) actuaries' positions and submit and 
discuss the reports with the board. The cost of the third actuary shall be borne by the city. No later 
than March 15 of every year, the board shall consider all the actuaries' reports and take the most 
appropriate, reasonable and prudent final action. All actuarial assumptions, cost methods and 
procedures used in determining the amount of available premium tax revenues shall be the same as 
those used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan. 
(b) ?Allocation of available premium tax revenues. Available premium tax revenues shall be allocated 
pro rata by head count among the retired deputy sheriff members who are eligible for the ad-hoc 
COLA and share plan participants, as provided in subsections (c) and (d) below; provided, in no 
event shall the amount allocated to each eligible person in any plan year exceed the amount 
allocated to each eligible person in the initial allocation year, excluding that portion of the initial 
allocation that is attributable to the cumulative excess premium tax revenues from prior plan years. 
Any available premium tax revenues in excess of the maximum combined allocation amounts for any 
plan year shall be held in the cumulative excess premium tax reserve and used to provide extra 
benefits, subject to subsection (e) below. 
(c) ?Ad-hoc COLA. In addition to any cost-of-living benefit payable from cumulative net actuarial gains 
under section 9-63(a)(2)c, retired deputy sheriff members who retire on or after December 1, 2007, 
shall be entitled to a pro-rata portion of the available funds described in subsection 9-72(b) to be paid 
directly to eligible retired members as an ad-hoc COLA benefit. 
(d) ?Deputy sheriff member share plan. 
(1) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a mechanism to pay required "extra benefits" 
to deputy sheriff members, pursuant to F.S. Ch. 185. The fund created by this section, 
hereinafter the Oakland Park Deputy Sheriff member share plan, shall be derived exclusively 
from [F.S.] chapter 185 premium tax revenues received from the state and not from any 
additional employer contributions by the city, or Broward Sheriff's Office, and shall be in addition 
to the police officer/deputy sheriff defined benefit pension paid by the Oakland Park Police, 
Firefighters and Public Safety Officers Retirement System. The Oakland Park Deputy Sheriff 
Member Share Plan shall be administered by the Board of Trustees of the Oakland Park Police, 
Firefighters and Public Safety Officers Retirement System. 
(2) ?Available funds. The funds to be deposited in the share plan each year are the allocated 
portion of available premium tax revenues as described in subsection 9-72(b), and shall be 
designated as "available funds" for the purpose of this section. 
(3) ?Share accounts. An individual share account shall be established for each active member who 
is employed as a deputy sheriff on the effective date of this section hereinafter "share plan 
participants." Share account balances shall be invested by the board of trustees and may be 
commingled for investment purposes with the other assets of the retirement system. Separate 
accounting shall be maintained for all commingled assets. At the end of each quarter, each 
participant's share account balance will be credited or debited with the same overall rate of 
return, net of all fees and investment related costs, earned by all other assets of the retirement 
system during that quarter, which may include investment losses, depending on the overall rate 
of return of the system. 
(4) ?Allocation of shares. On or before March 30 each year, the available funds determined as of 
September 30 of the preceding year shall be equally allocated among share plan participants 
and credited to the share plan participant's individual account. A share plan participant who 
retires shall no longer be eligible to participate in the share plan, but shall become eligible to 
receive ad-hoc COLA benefits under subsection 9-72(c). 
(5) ?Distributions. The account balance for each share plan participant shall be payable within 
ninety (90) days after the effective date of retirement from the system, or on such other date as 
is deemed feasible by the board of trustees. 
(6) ?Vesting. No share plan participant shall be entitled to payment of a share account balance 
unless: i) the share plan participant has completed ten (10) years of credited service under the 
Oakland Park Police, Firefighters and Public Safety Officers Retirement System as a deputy 
sheriff/police officer, and ii) the share plan participant becomes eligible for a normal, early, 
disability, or death benefit from the Oakland Park Police, Firefighters and Public Safety Officers 
Retirement System. In the event of the death of a share plan participant who has completed ten 
(10) years of credited service but prior to the payment of share plan balances, the accumulated 
share plan balance shall be paid to the share participant's designated beneficiary. Upon the 
separation from service of a non-vested share plan participant, the share account balance 
attributable to the non-vested participant shall revert back into the share plan and shall be 
reallocated unless the former share plan participant returns to service prior to the end of the 
plan year in which the separation occurred. 
(e) ?Notwithstanding any other provision of this section 9-72, in the event F.S. Ch. 185, is amended to 
allow a greater portion of premium tax revenues to be used by the employer to fund existing benefits, 
or to permit a reduction in current or future premium tax revenues that are required to be used for 
extra benefits, the share plan and ad-hoc COLA provided herein shall be adjusted or eliminated 
accordingly; and the maximum amount of any future premium tax revenues that are allowed to be 
used to offset the city's required contributions to the system, including any premium tax revenues 
held in the cumulative reserve, shall be used to offset the city's required contributions to the system.

Sec. 10½-22. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the

meanings given herein, unless otherwise expressly stated. When not inconsistent with the context, words 
used in the present tense include the future tense; words in the plural number include the singular 
number; and words in the singular number include the plural number; and the masculine gender includes 
the feminine gender. "And" and "or" may be read conjunctively or disjunctively. The words "shall" and 
"will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Unless otherwise expressly stated, words not defined in 
this article shall be given the meaning set forth in Title 47 of the United States Code, and, if not defined 
therein, their common and ordinary meaning. References to governmental entities (whether persons or 
entities) refer to those entities or their successors in authority. If specific provisions of law referred to 
herein are renumbered, then the reference shall be read to refer to the renumbered provision. References 
to laws, ordinances or regulations shall be interpreted broadly to cover government actions, however 
nominated, and include laws, ordinances and regulations now in force or hereinafter enacted or 
amended. 
    Abandonment shall mean the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided 
that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the 
physical structure continues to be used. For example, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, 
where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
    City shall mean City of Oakland Park, Florida. 
    Communications services shall mean the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, 
video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any 
electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or 
hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service", as defined in Section 202.11(2), Florida Statutes 
(2000), as it may be amended, is not included in the definition of "communications services" and cable 
service providers or providers of service via an open video system may be subject to other ordinances of 
the city. 
    Communications services provider shall mean any person providing communications services 
through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
Communications services provider shall also include any person that places or maintains a 
communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
    Communications facility or facility or system shall mean any permanent or temporary plant, 
equipment or property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, 
antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location 
markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or 
maintained in the public rights-of-way of the city and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey,

trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, 
assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include city

    Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or placing or maintaining shall mean to erect, 
construct, install, maintain, grade, excavate, place, repair, extend, replace, expand, remove, occupy, 
locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over 
communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is 
"placing or maintaining" the facilities. A party providing service only through resale or only through use of 
a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities 
through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through 
the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public 
rights-of-way. 
    Public rights-of-way shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, public highway, street, 
lane, bridge, sidewalk, road, waterway, tunnel, alley, or similar property for which the city is the authority 
that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to such property pursuant to applicable 
law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface to the extent 
the city holds a property interest therein. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public 
rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not 
include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of 
whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. No reference herein, or in any permit, to public 
rights-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its interest or other 
right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a registrant 
shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the city and as the city may have the 
undisputed right and power to give. 
    Registrant shall mean a communications services provider or other person that has registered with 
the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
    Registration or register shall mean the process described in this article whereby a communications 
services provider provides certain information to the city.

(a) ?A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in 
public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject 
to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a 
communications facility in public rights-of-way. A communications services provider with an existing 
communications facility in the public rights-of-way of the city as of the effective date [July 18, 2001] 
of this article shall comply with this article within sixty (60) days from the effective date of this article, 
including, but not limited to, registration, or be in violation hereof. 
(b) ?A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-
way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications 
facilities in public rights-of-way. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider 
from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the 
city's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider 
from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(c) ?Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility 
in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the 
following information: 
(1) ?Name of the applicant; 
(2) ?Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection 
with the registration and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3) ?For Registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it 
provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4) ?Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that 
registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article;

authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the 
State of Florida, including the number of the certificate of incorporation; and 
(7) ?A security fund in accordance with this article. 
(d) ?The city manager, or his designee shall review the information submitted by the applicant. If the 
applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) above, the registration shall be 
effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city 
determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) above, the 
city shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-
effectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of 
registration information from the applicant. 
(e) ?A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer 
place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no 
longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a 
registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public 
rights-of-way. 
(f) ?Registration shall not in itself establish any right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or 
maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city, but shall establish for 
the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are 
expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any 
additional city's ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g) ?A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in 
accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially 
registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year 
immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even 
numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be submitted

complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h) ?In accordance with applicable city articles, codes or regulations and this article, a permit shall be 
required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications

permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting 
requirements are met.

emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may 
impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a 
communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-
of-way specifically identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain 
activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual 
permits. 
(c) ?As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in 
public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following:

additional communications facilities within the public rights-of way if there is insufficient space to 
accommodate all of the requests to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-
way, for the protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way or to accommodate city plans 
for public improvements or projects that the city determines are in the public interest. 
(e) ?All communications facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with 
the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property

in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit. 
The registrant shall be liable for the displacement, damage or destruction of any property, irrigation 
system or landscaping as a result of the placement or maintenance of its facility within the public 
rights-of-way. The public works director may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations

before such work after the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility 
in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 
thirty (30) days following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform

in accordance with Section 337.402, Florida Statutes (2000), as it may be amended. The registrant 
shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any improper restoration work at its own 
expense for twelve (12) months following the original completion of the work.

rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 337.403 and 337.404, Florida Statutes 
(2000); as they may be amended. 
(i) ?A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities on public rights-of-
way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge 
upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j) ?A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent 
with accepted industry practice and applicable law.

coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, 
installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in 
the subject public rights-of-way. The city may require registrant to alter its placement or maintenance 
schedule as city determines to be reasonably necessary so as to minimize disruptions and 
disturbance in the public rights-of-way. The city may provide a more definite time frame based on 
individual city construction or maintenance schedules. 
(n) ?A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere, displace, 
damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm 
drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the 
public rights-of-way of the city. 
(o) ?The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of 
city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work 
or costs incurred by registrant or provision of services shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this

public health, safety or welfare, the city will provide registrant at least three (3) days written notice 
setting forth the violation and requesting correction. 
(q) ?A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-
way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public 
rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant 
shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format or an electronic format 
specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a 
format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. The plans shall be in a 
digitized format showing the two-dimensional location of the facilities based on the city's 
geographical database, or other format acceptable to the city. The city shall maintain the 
confidentiality of such plans and any other information provided in accordance with section 202.195, 
Florida statutes (2000), as it may be amended.

water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, 
and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be 
deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. Registrant 
shall, if registrant so agrees, allow city facilities to be co-located within city's public rights-of-way 
through the use of a joint trench during registrant's construction project. Such joint trench projects 
shall be negotiated in good faith by separate agreement between registrant and city and may be 
subjected to other city rights-of-way requirements. The city further reserves without limitation the 
right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the 
public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time 
be altered.

or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of 
such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and 
the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be 
given not less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. If 
city requests a temporary raising or lowering of a facility for a public purpose, city shall not be 
charged for the temporary raising or lowering of the facility.

Sec. 10½-69. - Demonstration of public need. 
(a) ?Public need may be established by the following method, which is not exclusive. If another method 
to establish public need is desired by a publishing entity, then the city and the publishing entity shall 
jointly determine whether the alternate method is a legitimate and accurate means to determine 
public usage of newsracks in question. A distributor desiring to establish a public need may place an 
extra newsrack at a proposed location, after notice to the city, for a test period of one (1) month. No 
certificate of compliance will be required; however, an application must first be completed on a form 
provided by the engineering and development department. 
(b) ?If during the one-month test period the average circulation from the newsracks equals or exceeds 
seventy-five (75) percent of the capacity of the newsrack for publications published other than daily 
or for daily publications, the average Sunday circulation from the newsracks equals or exceeds 
seventy-five (75) percent of the capacity of the newsrack, then a public need will be deemed to have 
been established. Assuming the extra newsrack complies with all other appropriate sections of this 
article, a certificate of compliance will be issued. If the extra newsrack does not comply with all other 
appropriate sections of this article, the deficiencies must be corrected before a certificate of 
compliance will be issued. 
(Ord. No. O-2011-011, § 2, 5-4-11) 


Sec. 10½-70. - Removal procedures. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of the above sections, one-hundred eighty (180) days after this article 
becomes effective and at any time thereafter, any newsrack without a certificate of compliance will have a 
notice of violation attached by the code enforcement division. If the newsrack is not removed or a 
certificate of compliance obtained within fifteen (15) days after such notice is attached, the code 
enforcement division may have the newsrack impounded and shall bill the certificate of compliance holder 
or owner for expenses of such removal and storage. Within fifteen (15) days after removal, the newsrack 
shall be deemed unclaimed property in possession of the city and may be disposed of pursuant to Florida 
Statutes § 705.103.

(Ord. No. O-89-6, § 3, 6-7-89; Ord. No. O-2006-012, 6-7-06) 


Sec. 12-1.1. - Scope and purpose. 
    The scope and purpose of this chapter are: 
(1) ?To provide for effective management and financing of a stormwater management system within 
the city (the "system"); 
(2) ?To provide a mechanism for mitigating the damaging effects of uncontrolled and unplanned 
stormwater runoff from both a water quality and water quantity standpoint; 
(3) ?To improve the public health, safety and welfare by providing for the safe and efficient capture 
and conveyance of stormwater runoff and the correction of stormwater problems; 
(4) ?To establish a reasonable stormwater management assessment or fee based on each 
property's estimated contribution of stormwater runoff to the system and the benefit derived 
from the use of the facilities of the system; 
(5) ?To encourage and facilitate urban water resources management techniques, including but not 
limited to the retention-detention of stormwater runoff, minimization of the need to construct 
storm sewers, and the enhancement of the environment; and 
(6) ?To provide for the issuance of bonds to finance additions, extensions and improvements to the 
system. 
(Ord. No. O-2011-015, § 2, 7-20-11) 


Sec. 12-1.2. - Findings and determinations. 
    It is hereby found, determined and declared as follows: 
(1) ?As a means of complying with federal and state-mandated goals and priorities relating to 
stormwater management, to facilitate the implementation of a stormwater drainage master plan as 
required by the city's comprehensive growth management plan, and to provide for the current and 
future needs of the city with respect to collection, control and disposal of storm and other surface 
water within the geographical boundaries of the city, the commission hereby finds it to be in the best 
interests of the city to combine the city's existing system and all stormwater drainage facilities 
relating thereto presently owned and managed by the city, including but not limited to such storm 
sewers, drains, culverts, retention systems, detention basins, drainage wells, conduits and 
appurtenant features, catch basins, desilting facilities, recharging basins, outfall structures, 
equipment and all appurtenances, whether man-made or natural, necessary, useful or convenient for 
a unified stormwater management system. 
(2) ?Land use and development affecting storm and surface water should be managed, regulated and 
controlled under the unified management of a city-wide system for the purpose of, among other 
things, reducing or controlling erosion, sedimentation and turbidity, and other pollution of water, 
danger and damage to life and property, and to protect and encourage the use of natural and 
efficient man-made means to these ends. 
(3) ?The establishment and operation of the system will serve a vital public purpose and promote the 
common interests, and provide for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(4) ?Those elements of the system which provide for the collection, storage, treatment and conveyance 
of stormwater, are of benefit and provide value to all properties within the city. 
(5) ?The benefits provided by the stormwater utility bear a logical relationship to the value, use and 
characteristics of the property located within the stormwater utility area. 
(6) ?The cost of operating and maintaining the system and the financing and refinancing of existing and 
future necessary repairs, replacements, improvements, and extensions thereof should, to the extent 
practicable, be allocated in relationship to each property's estimated contribution of stormwater 
runoff to the system and the benefit derived from the use of the system. 
(7) ?The stormwater assessments authorized by this article provide an equitable method of funding the 
capital cost of stormwater improvements, the customer service cost, the utility-wide operating cost 
and the maintenance service cost, by fairly and reasonably allocating such costs to benefitted 
property classified on the basis of the stormwater burden expected to be generated by the physical 
characteristics and use of such property. 
(8) ?It is the intent of the commission that the stormwater management assessment or fee partially fund 
the stormwater utility enterprise fund for the city. 
(9) ?The benefited area, with respect to developed property, shall be assessed a charge on the basis of 
the prorated amount of the impervious area, developed from localized studies within the city. 
(10) ?It is recognized that unimproved land also contributes stormwater runoff to the system and 
receives a benefit from the use of the system, and therefore such lands should also be assessed a 
proportional charge based upon the estimated contribution of stormwater runoff to the system and 
the benefit derived from the use of the system. 
(11) ?The stormwater assessments imposed pursuant to this article are imposed by the commission, not 
the property appraiser or tax collector. Any activity of the property appraiser or tax collector under the 
provisions of this article shall be construed as ministerial.

based on provision of functional stormwater management facilities meeting certain criteria. 
(c) ?Owner-initiated adjustments. Requests for adjustment of the stormwater management assessment 
shall be submitted to the director, who shall have authority to adjust stormwater management 
assessments, to administer the procedures and standards, and to review criteria for the adjustment 
of such assessments as established herein. In the review of adjustment requests, consideration shall 
be given to properties with valid surface water management permits indicating the provision of 
functional stormwater management facilities (retention or detention). Adjustments may also be made 
if there has been an error relative to the use of property classification, total area or impervious area 
in the computation of the assessment. The following procedures shall apply to all requests for 
adjustments of the stormwater management assessment permitted under this chapter: 
(1) ?The director shall prepare and maintain a written credit policy manual which shall outline the 
requirements to qualify for a credit and the methodology for computing a credit for any given 
parcel. The most current version of that credit policy manual shall be used for the 
implementation of this subsection. 
(2) ?Any owner who believes the stormwater management assessment is incorrect may, subject to 
the limitations set forth in this section, submit an adjustment request to the director. 
(3) ?The adjustment request shall be in writing and shall set forth, in detail, the grounds upon which 
the correction is sought. 
(4) ?The adjustment request must be made within sixty (60) days after receipt by the owner of his or 
her tax bill containing the stormwater management assessment. The adjustment request will be 
reviewed by the director within a four-month period from the date of filing of the adjustment 
request. Consideration by the director of the owner's request for adjustment shall not relieve the 
owner of the obligation to make timely payment of the stormwater management assessment. in 
the event an adjustment is granted by the director which decreases the stormwater 
management assessment, the owner shall be entitled to a refund of the excess stormwater 
management assessments paid. The refund shall be mailed by the Broward County Tax 
Collector (the "tax collector") unless the tax collector and the city agree otherwise. 
(5) ?The owner requesting the adjustment may be required, at his own cost, to provide 
supplemental information to the director including, but not limited to, survey data certified by a 
professional land surveyor and/or engineering reports approved by a professional engineer and 
acceptable to the director. Failure to provide such information may result in the denial of the 
adjustment request. 
(6) ?The adjustment to the stormwater management assessment will be made upon the granting of 
the adjustment request, in writing, by the director. The document granting the adjustment 
request will be provided to the owner and will also be sent to the tax collector. A denial of an 
adjustment request shall be made in writing by the director, a copy of which shall be provided to 
the owner. 
(d) ?Appeals. All determinations of the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the city. 
These appeals must be filed within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written determination of the 
director. The city manager shall complete a review within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request for 
review and shall be evaluated based upon the standards and review criteria set forth in this chapter. 
The decision of the city manager shall be final. 
(e) ?City-initiated adjustments. Any errors in the stormwater management assessment, or failure to 
charge a stormwater management assessment, may be corrected by the director within sixty (60) 
days after opening of the tax roll for collection. Corrections which result in an increase in the 
stormwater management assessment cannot be imposed until the owner has consented in writing to 
the increase or has been given at least ten (10) days' notice by certified mail and an opportunity to 
be heard. Once the adjustment is finalized, the director shall send documentation reflecting the 
adjustment to the owner and to the tax collector. 
(f) ?Inspections. The city may require periodic inspection of on-site stormwater management (retention-
detention) facilities on parcels to which an adjustment to the stormwater management assessment 
has been granted. The owner benefiting from such adjustment shall be required to pay to the city an 
annual inspection fee in an amount determined by the director. For the purpose of protecting the 
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, the director may cause an inspection of any 
property within the benefited area. Such inspection shall be made upon reasonable notice to the 
owner or occupant of the property unless an emergency exists, as determined solely by the director.

house shall be obligated to pay the stormwater management assessments. All delinquent 
stormwater management assessment liens may be enforced at any time by the city at least thirty 
(30) days subsequent to the date of the service of the notice of lien for the amount due under such 
recorded liens, including all interest charges, plus costs and a reasonable attorney's fee by a 
proceeding in a court of law or equity to enforce or foreclose such liens in the manner in which a 
mortgage lien is foreclosed under the laws of Florida, or the collection and enforcement of payment 
thereof may be accomplished by any other method authorized by law. It shall be lawful to join in any 
complaint or foreclosure or any legal proceedings, any one (1) or more lots or parcels of land that is 
the subject of a lien or liens. In the case where a tenant in possession of any premises or buildings 
shall pay said assessment, it shall relieve the land owner from such obligation and lien; but the city 
shall not be required to look to any person whatsoever other than the owner for the payment of such 
assessment. No changes of ownership or occupation shall affect the application of this chapter, and 
the failure of any owner to learn that he purchased property against which a lien for stormwater 
management assessment exists, shall in no way affect his or her responsibility for such payment. 
The annual stormwater management assessment shall be subject to all collection provisions of F.S. 
Chapter 197, as amended and supplemented, including provisions relating to discount for early 
payment, prepayment by installment method, deferred payment, penalty for delinquent payment, and 
issuance and sale of tax certificates and tax deeds for nonpayment, as provided by law. Such 
stormwater management assessment is subject to becoming a lien against homestead, as provided 
in Section 4, Article X, of the Florida Constitution. 
(b) ?It is the intent of the city by the enactment of this section that, until fully paid and discharged or 
barred by law, the stormwater management assessments shall be prior to other liens, except that 
such liens shall be on a parity with the lien of state, county and municipal taxes, and any lien for 
charges for services created pursuant to F.S. Section 159.17.

intent to adopt the uniform method of collection pursuant to F.S. Section 197.3632, as amended and 
supplemented. A copy of such resolution was provided to the Broward County Property Appraiser. 
(b) ?Between June 1 and September 15, 2011, the city shall adopt a non-ad valorem assessment roll at 
a public hearing after notice of such hearing has been given, as required under the Act. The 
commission shall adopt a rate resolution prior to adopting the non-ad valorem assessment roll. 
(c) ?The city shall, each year, do what is required under the Act to continue the uniform collection 
method unless it is determined by the commission that such other method of collecting the 
stormwater management assessment is in the best interests of the city. If any obligations secured by 
the stormwater management assessments have been issued by the city on or after the adoption of 
the uniform method of collection, the commission shall not discontinue the uniform method of 
collection without the unanimous consent of the owners of such obligations. 
(d) ?The stormwater management assessments shall be imposed against the owners of all real property 
in the city, other than nonassessed property, and collected pursuant to the uniform method of 
collection for fiscal year commencing October 1, 2011. Thereafter, the city will use the uniform 
method of collection unless the city determines that another method of collecting stormwater 
management assessments is in the best interest of the city.

(a) ?Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any stormwater 
service assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after 
the approval thereof, and any stormwater service assessment as finally approved shall be competent 
and sufficient evidence that such stormwater service assessment was duly levied, that the 
stormwater service assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings 
adequate to such stormwater service assessment were duly had, taken and performed as required 
by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be 
clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions 
of this section, any party objecting to a stormwater service assessment imposed pursuant to this 
article must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed

Sec. 12-2.10. - Stormwater management enterprise fund. 
(a) ?All stormwater management assessments collected by the city shall be paid into an enterprise fund, 
which is known as the "stormwater utility enterprise fund" or the "fund". In addition, all other 
revenues, funding sources and interest earnings derived from, or attributable to the system, shall be 
deposited in the stormwater utility enterprise fund. Such fund shall be used for the purpose of paying 
the cost of additions, extensions and improvements to the system, paying debt service on obligations 
issued to finance or refinance such additions, extensions and improvements and for paying the cost 
of operation and maintenance of the system. To the extent that the stormwater management 
assessments collected are insufficient to construct the needed stormwater drainage facilities, the 
cost of the same may be paid from such city fund as may be determined by the commission, but the 
commission may order the reimbursement of such fund if additional assessments are thereafter 
collected. notwithstanding the foregoing, no person shall have the right to compel the city to 
contribute general fund moneys to the system. When the fund has surplus dollars on hand in excess 
of current needs, the surplus dollars may be invested in any lawful manner and such investment 
earnings shall be deposited in the fund. 
(b) ?The stormwater management assessments collected shall not be used for general or other 
governmental or proprietary purposes of the city, except to pay for the equitable share of the cost of 
accounting, management and government thereof. Other than as described above, the stormwater

    Floods from stormwater runoff may occasionally occur which exceed the level of service of storm 
drainage facilities constructed, operated, or maintained by funds made available under this chapter. This 
chapter shall not be construed or interpreted to mean that property subject to the stormwater 
management assessments established herein will always (or at any time) be free from stormwater 
flooding or flood damage, or that stormwater systems capable of handling all storm events can be cost-
effectively constructed, operated, or maintained; neither shall this chapter create any liability on the part 
of, or cause of action against, the city, or any official or employee thereof, for any flood damage that may 
result from such storms or the runoff thereof; neither does this chapter purport to reduce the need or the 
necessity for obtaining flood insurance by individual property owners.

Sec. 12-2.15. - Alternative method of collection. 
    In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city may elect to collect the stormwater 
charge by any other method which is authorized by law or provided by this section. 
    As an alternative to the foregoing, a stormwater assessment imposed against any property may be 
collected on the bill for any utility service provided to such property. The commission may contract for 
such billing services with any utility not owned by the city. 
(Ord. No. O-2011-015, § 2, 7-20-11) 


Sec. 12-3. - Stormwater management utility fee. 
    A stormwater fee is hereby imposed upon each lot and parcel within the city for services and facilities 
provided by the stormwater management utility. For purposes of imposing the stormwater fee, all lots and 
parcels within the city are classified into the following three (3) customer classes:

Sec. 12-4. - Schedule of rates. 
(a) ?The director is directed to prepare a list of lots and parcels within the city and assign a classification 
of residential, nonresidential or undeveloped to each lot or parcel. 
(b) ?The city commission, upon recommendation of the director, has established the average square 
footage of impervious area of the ERU to be one thousand five hundred seven (1,507) square feet. 
(c) ?The fee imposed for residential properties shall be the rate for one (1) ERU multiplied by the number 
of individual dwelling units existing on the property (ERU rate × number of dwelling units). 
(d) ?The fee imposed for nonresidential properties as defined herein shall be the rate for one (1) ERU 
multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of a nonresidential 
property by the ERU (ERU rate × impervious area/ERU impervious area). 
(e) ?The fee imposed for undeveloped properties as defined herein shall be the rate for one (1) ERU 
multiplied by a factor established by resolution and then divided by the square footage for one (1) 
ERU established by resolution. The city commission, upon recommendation of the director, has 
established the aforementioned factor as 12 percent (0.12). 
(f) ?The director shall be responsible for determining the impervious area based on data supplied by the 
county property appraiser, or by the property owner, tenant or developer if such information is 
unavailable from the county property appraiser. The director may require additional information as 
necessary to make the determination. The billing amount shall be updated by the director based on 
an additions or deletions to the impervious area as approved through the building permit process.

20-11) 


Sec. 12-5. - Billing and payment; penalties. 
(a) ?Bills or statements for the stormwater utility fee shall be rendered, in a manner most advantageous 
to the city. Bills shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the same 
penalties as other city utilities and as set forth for water in chapter 22 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(b) ?For properties normally receiving monthly utility bills for other services, the stormwater utility fee 
shall be included in the monthly utility bill rendered to the established customer. At the discretion of 
the city finance director, fee waivers for short-term inactive utility accounts accruing fees of ten 
dollars ($10.00) or less in a six-month period may be made for purposes of administrative 
convenience. 
(c) ?For properties not receiving monthly utility bills for other services, the bill or statement for the 
stormwater utility fee shall be sent to the owner of the property as determined from the tax rolls. The 
utility billing division may render annual or semiannual billing at the beginning of the defined period 
on such properties if determined to be in the best interest of the city. 
(d) ?Bills are due when rendered and shall be considered as received by the customer when delivered or 
mailed to the service address or such other address as provided in writing by customer. Non-receipt 
of bills by customer shall not release or diminish obligation of customer with respect to payment 
thereof, unless bills have been returned to the city for incorrect addresses. The owner of a property 
is ultimately responsible for all fees imposed under this chapter. 
(e) ?Application of customer payments. When a customer of the city's utilities systems has a combined 
utilities services billing, customer payments will be applied to satisfy any outstanding indebtedness in 
the following order: water tax, penalties, stormwater, solid waste, sewer, and water. 
(f) ?Collection fee. In the event the city sends a delinquent account to a collection agency for collection, 
a collection fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be added to the account. 
(g) ?Each invoice shall become delinquent if payment is not received in utility and billing services 
division within twenty-five (25) days after the invoice date. All fees, excluding penalties, that remain 
unpaid at the end of twenty-five (25) days from the invoice date shall be subject to a penalty of one 
and one-half (1.50) percent. If any invoice is not paid within forty (40) days after the invoice date and 
if the account also receives water service from the city, the furnishing of water to the account shall be 
suspended. When an account remains in arrears ninety (90) days after the invoice date, the account 
shall be closed and any existing deposit applied to the arrears. Any account holder whose account 
becomes delinquent shall be subject to all laws, federal, state and local, allowing for the collection of 
the full amount of the delinquent account plus all costs and fees associated with the city's collection 
efforts. However, nothing contained herein shall limit the city's authority to approve "payment plans" 
for the extended payment of stormwater fees, so long as such extended terms are both reasonable 
and appropriate, in the sole discretion of the city, and are based upon customer hardship. 
(h) ?The city may utilize other county and/or municipal agencies to bill stormwater fees for the city. If 
alternate agencies are utilized, billing and payment terms and conditions will be in accordance with 
those of the billing agency. 
(Ord. No. O-89-6, § 3, 6-7-89; Ord. No. O-91-9, § 2, 9-4-91; Ord. No. O-2006-012, 6-7-06; Ord.

Sec. 12-6. - Adjustment of fees. 
(a) ?Director. For purposes of this section, the term "director" shall mean the director of public works or 
his designee. 
(b) ?The term "adjustment" shall also apply to the application of a credit to a parcel of land based on 
provision of functional stormwater management facilities meeting certain criteria. 
(c) ?Owner-initiated adjustments. Requests for adjustment of the stormwater utility fee shall be submitted 
to the director, who shall have authority to adjust stormwater utility fees, to administer the procedures 
and standards, and to review criteria for the adjustment of such assessments as established herein. 
In the review of adjustment requests, consideration shall be given to properties with valid surface 
water management permits indicating the provision of functional stormwater management facilities 
(retention or detention). Adjustments may also be made if there has been an error relative to the use 
of property classification, total area or impervious area in the computation of the fee. The following 
procedures shall apply to all requests for adjustments of the stormwater utility fee permitted under 
this chapter: 
(d) ?The director shall prepare and maintain a written credit policy manual which shall outline the 
requirements to qualify for a credit and the methodology for computing a credit for any given parcel. 
The most current version of that credit policy manual shall be used for the implementation of this 
subsection. 
(e) ?Any owner who believes the stormwater utility fee is incorrect may, subject to the limitations set forth 
in this Section, submit an adjustment request to the director. 
(f) ?The adjustment request shall be in writing and shall set forth, in detail, the grounds upon which the 
correction is sought. 
(g) ?The adjustment request must be made within sixty (60) days after receipt by the owner of his or her 
utility bill containing the stormwater utility fee. The adjustment request will be reviewed by the 
director within a four-month period from the date of filing of the adjustment request. Consideration by 
the director of the owner's request for adjustment shall not relieve the owner of the obligation to 
make timely payment of the stormwater utility fee. In the event an adjustment is granted by the 
director which decreases the stormwater utility fee, the owner shall be entitled to a refund of the 
excess paid. 
(h) ?The owner requesting the adjustment may be required, at his own cost, to provide supplemental 
information to the director including, but not limited to, survey data certified by a professional land 
surveyor and/or engineering reports approved by a professional engineer and acceptable to the 
director. Failure to provide such information may result in the denial of the adjustment request. 
(i) ?The adjustment to the stormwater utility fee will be made upon the granting of the adjustment 
request, in writing, by the director. The document granting the adjustment will be provided to the 
owner. A denial of an adjustment request shall be made in writing by the director to the owner. 
(j) ?Appeals. All determinations of the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the city. 
These appeals must be filed within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written determination of the 
director. The city manager shall complete a review within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request for 
review and shall be evaluated based upon the standards and review criteria set forth in this chapter. 
The decision of the city manager shall be final. 
(k) ?Inspections. The city may require periodic inspection of on-site stormwater management (retention-
detention) facilities on parcels to which an adjustment to the stormwater utility fee has been granted. 
The owner benefiting from such adjustment shall be required to pay to the city an annual inspection 
fee in an amount determined by the director. For the purpose of protecting the health, safety and 
welfare of the citizens of the city, the director may cause an inspection of any property within the 
benefited area. Such inspection shall be made upon reasonable notice to the owner or occupant of 
the property unless an emergency exists, as determined solely by the director. 
(Ord. No. O-89-6, § 3, 6-7-89; Ord. No. O-2006-012, 6-7-06; Ord. No. 2010-018, § 5, 5-5-10; 
Ord. O-2011-015, § 2, 7-20-11) 


Sec. 12-7. - Capital contributions. 
    Procedures and standards developed by the director and a representative of the engineering 
department shall define appropriate means by which to optimize development capital contributions in the 
implementation of basic specific stormwater systems. These basic specific capital contributions shall take 
the form of "fee-in-lieu-of" or "availability charges." Each situation will be analyzed by the director, and a 
specific written decision will be developed. The application of each is defined as follows: 
(1) ?Fee-in-lieu-of is applied to a site-specific negotiated procedure, wherein a development's 
stormwater contribution (quantity and quality) is assessed its share of the capital needs of the 
facilities required to serve the development in question. This capital contribution would be used 
to implement city-owned stormwater facilities. The process does not apply wherein the 
stormwater facilities are privately held. Each application is evaluated against the city's 
stormwater master plan for the watershed involved or, while the master plan is incomplete, the 
cumulative impacts from the development. 
(2) ?Availability charge is administered on a site-specific basis identical to the fee-in-lieu-of 
procedure noted above; the only difference is that the capital investment advanced by the city in 
implementing a stormwater facility is now recovered through an availability charge. The capital 
charge is determined on a prorata share of the capacity used by the new applicant or by the 
cumulative impact from the development upon all impacted facilities. 
(Ord. No. O-89-6, § 3, 6-7-89; Ord. No. O-2006-012, 6-7-06) 


Sec. 12-8. - Program responsibility. 
    It shall be the duty of the director to administer the stormwater utility program. The director shall keep 
an accurate record of all persons using the services and facilities of said stormwater management utility 
of the city and make changes in accordance with the rates and charges established in this chapter or by 
resolution. 
(Ord. No. O-89-6, § 3, 6-7-89; Ord. No. O-2006-012, 6-7-06) 


Sec. 12-9. - Stormwater utility enterprise fund. 
    There shall be established a stormwater utility enterprise fund for the deposit of all fees and charges 
collected by the stormwater utility. These funds shall be for the exclusive use of the city's stormwater 
management utility including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1) ?Stormwater management services, such as studies, design, permit review, plan preparation 
and development review. 
(2) ?Operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the stormwater collection, storage, 
treatment and conveyance infrastructure. 
(3) ?Project costs related to constructing major or minor structural improvements to the stormwater-
related infrastructure as provided in the city-wide stormwater management plan. 
(4) ?Administrative costs associated with the management of the stormwater utility. 
(5) ?Debt service financing of stormwater-related capital improvements.

Oakland Park may be recorded in the Official Records of Broward County, Florida. The notice of lien 
shall contain a sworn statement showing the amount and date of said bill and the legal description of 
the property against which the lien is assessed. The recordation of the notice of lien shall constitute a 
lien on the real property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal, 
interest, and penalties, plus costs of court, if any, until final payment is made. The amount due shall 
bear interest at the legal rate beginning from the date of the assessment of the lien. The notice of 
lien, as recorded in the Official Records of Broward County, shall be prima facie evidence of the debt 
to the City of Oakland Park and may be foreclosed as mortgages are foreclosed in the circuit court.

the container, and shall meet land development code requirements. All screenings shall be 
maintained for function, safety, and appearance. 
(2) ?Gates intended for service access shall provide an opening width of at least ten (10) feet for 
each mechanical container, and shall be designed to remain open when collection service is 
provided. Gates shall be required when the service entrance of the screening enclosure faces a 
public right-of-way, alleyway or is visible from a residential zoning district. 
(3) ?Where a gate in the screening structure faces a public right-of-way, alleyway or is visible from a 
residential district, the gate shall be closed except when collection service is provided. The 
service provider may close any gate left open in violation of this subsection. A service fee, on

be assessed against the owner or occupant of the property and shall be collected in the manner 
provided by section 13-11.5. The fee shall be supplemental to any other penalties provided for

requirements of this section, the development review committee is authorized to grant waivers from 
the required number of required parking spaces, minimum pervious area requirements, or 
landscaping, buffering, and/or setback requirements of the land development code in order to 
accommodate the location of an existing refuse or recycling mechanical, dumpster, compaction, or 
roll-off container in conformance with paragraph (b) above. In considering which, if any, waivers to 
grant, the development review committee shall consider the number, extent and relative importance 
of existing and resulting non-conformities to proper site functioning and compatibility with adjacent 
uses. Appeal of a rejected waiver request may be made to the public works director or other 
designee of the city manager within ten (10) days of written notification of the rejected waiver. 
(d) ?In circumstances where it is not physically possible for a property to accommodate a refuse or 
recycling mechanical, dumpster, compaction, or roll-off container and the required screening 
enclosure; and where the granting of waivers is deemed unacceptable by the development review 
committee; and where the container is situated in a public right of way, service shall be changed 
from dumpster to cart service. 
(e) ?The city commission, following review and recommendation by the development review committee, 
at a duly noticed public hearing may grant exceptions to the container screening enclosure 
requirements of this section, and allow the container service to remain, where specific lot conditions 
make compliance impractical, the visibility of the container from a roadway is minimal, or the safety 
of the collection vehicle or the public in general would be compromised by the construction of the 
screening enclosure. 
(f) ?Temporary mechanical, dumpster, compaction or roll-off containers used for the collection of refuse 
or recycling during special events for a period of less than seven (7) days are exempt from the 
container screening requirements contained in this section.

contained in this section.

City of Fort Lauderdale, Broward County or any other wholesale provider. The pass-through charge 
will be applied to all billable wastewater treated beginning October 1, 2011. 
(2) ?Determination of charge. The city shall calculate the pass-through adjustment and implement any 
changes in the charge consistent with the effective date of any change in the cost of purchased 
wastewater as billed by the city from the City of Fort Lauderdale, Broward County or any other 
wholesale wastewater provider. The city may implement the pass-through charge during any portion 
of the fiscal year as a result of material events, which may affect the financial condition of the utility 
system. Such material events may include, but not be limited to: (a) a rate adjustment enacted by the 
City of Fort Lauderdale, Broward County or any other wholesale wastewater provider; (b) 
implementation of an unforeseen surcharge or additional billing adjustment by the City of Fort 
Lauderdale, Broward County or any other wholesale wastewater provider. 
(3) ?The STPTA shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula: 
STPTA = ((BC × M) + (UC × BU)) × (1+T) / SF 
Whereby: 
STPTA 
= 
The purchased wastewater pass-through charge expressed on a dollars per thousand gallons 
basis which is to be added to the wastewater usage or flow charge that is currently in effect as 
of the date of the pass-through application. 
BC 
= 
The per unit change in any base costs or charges that are billed by any wholesale wastewater 
provider to the city through a large user or similar agreement that is not based on metered 
wastewater flow or any measure of consumption for wastewater delivered to the point of 
connection between the wholesale wastewater provider and the city. 
M 
= 
The number of months in the fiscal year — (12). 
UC 
= 
The per unit change in any usage or volumetric charges that are billed by any wholesale 
wastewater provider to the city through a large user or similar agreement that is based on 
metered wastewater flow or any measure of consumption for wastewater delivered to the 
point of connection between the wholesale wastewater provider and the city. 
BU 
= 
The actual billed wastewater usage (consumption) as invoiced by the respective wholesale 
wastewater supplier to the city which is increasing the usage or volumetric rates for service 
that occurred during the city's most recently completed fiscal year expressed in thousands of 
gallons. 
T 
= 
Any applicable taxes or surcharges which may be imposed upon the city from time to time by 
jurisdictions having regulatory authority which are directly related to receiving wastewater 
treatment service from the wholesale wastewater providers to the city on a sales-for-resale 
basis. 
SF 
= 
The actual billed wastewater flow (usage or sewer sales) based on metered water sales by the 
city or other providers of water services to all classes of city customers or users using city 
wastewater processing services during the city's most recently completed fiscal year 
expressed in thousands of gallons.

Sec. 15-4.2. - Annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment. 
(1) ?The city will adjust rates every year beginning October, 1 2013 (beginning of fiscal year 2014). The 
annual rate index adjustment should be based on: i) the percentage change in the Consumer Price 
Index for all Urban Areas (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of Labor from July 1 
of the preceding calendar year until June 30 of the current calendar year applied to the level of 
operating expenses as generally defined by commonly accepted accounting principles for the most 
recently completed fiscal year, divided by ii) the total sales revenues from monthly water and sewer 
rates for the most recently completed fiscal year, exclusive of wholesale water and wastewater 
purchases incurred during such fiscal year. 
(2) ?Calculations will be completed by applying the prior fiscal year operating expenses less actual cost 
of purchased water and wastewater equals the "Net Operating Expenses." The Net Operating 
Expenses times the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Areas as 
published by the United States Department of Labor from July 1 of the preceding calendar year until 
June 30 of the current calendar year ("CPI-U") equals the "Index Adjustment Amount." The Index 
Adjustment Amount divided by the prior fiscal year revenues from the sum of the monthly base 
charges and the consumption charges equals the "Price Index Rate Adjustment" (rounded and 
carried to the 1/100 place) to be applied to the applicable water and wastewater monthly user 
charges. The annual index rate adjustment is calculated as follows: 
Fiscal Year Operating Expenses ? Cost of Water and Wastewater Purchased = Net Operating 
Expenses 
(Net Operating Expenses) × (CPI-U) = Index Adjustment Amount

Sec. 15-4.5. - Sewer service, establishment and discontinuance of service, invoicing and delinquency. 
(a) ?A request for commencement, transfer or termination of services by the customer requires proof of 
being either an owner of, or tenant at, the service location. 
(b) ?Bills are due when rendered and shall be considered as received by the customer when delivered or 
mailed to the service address or such other address as provided in writing by customer. Non-receipt 
of bills by customer shall not release or diminish obligation of customer with respect to payment 
thereof, unless bills have been returned to the city for incorrect addresses. Each invoice shall 
become delinquent if payment is not received in utility and billing services division within twenty-five 
(25) days after the invoice date. All fees, excluding penalties, that remain unpaid at the end of 
twenty-five (25) days from the invoice date shall be subject to a penalty of one and one-half (1.50) 
percent. If the bill is not paid within forty (40) days of the invoice date, the furnishing of water, if 
provided in conjunction with sewer service, shall be suspended. When an account remains in arrears 
ninety (90) days from the invoice date, the account shall be closed and the existing deposit applied 
to the arrears. Any account holder whose account becomes delinquent shall be subject to all laws 
federal, state, and local, allowing for the collection of the full amount of the delinquent account plus 
all costs and fees associated with city's collection efforts. However, nothing contained herein shall 
limit the city's authority to approve "payment plans" for the extended payment of sewer charges, so 
long as such extended terms are both reasonable and appropriate, in the sole discretion of the city, 
and are based upon customer hardship. 
(1) ?Collection fee. In the event the city sends a delinquent account to a collection agency for 
collection, a collection fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be added to the account. 
(c) ?Fees for requests for account history printouts shall be in accordance with section 2-13. 
(d) ?Application of customer payments. When a customer of the city's utilities systems has a combined 
utilities services billing, payments will be applied sequentially to water tax, penalties, stormwater, 
solid waste, sewer, other services and lastly water. 
(e) ?To re-establish service after having service suspended due to delinquency, all delinquent amounts, 
fees, and deposits as described below for all delinquent accounts (sewer, water, solid waste and 
stormwater) must be paid in full in advance. Where in the judgment of the city manager or designee 
it appears that the amount of such deposit is not sufficient to indemnify the city against the possible 
non-collection of charges the city manager may, using discretion, require a deposit equal to twice the 
amount of the largest actual or reasonably anticipated monthly or quarterly bill. Upon payment of all 
required amounts, service will be restored as soon as possible the same or next business day, or, if 
not possible during normal working hours, after normal working hours if the customer elects to pay 
the after-hours fee described below. Required payment amounts include: 
(1) ?All delinquent amounts, including penalties and interest as applicable, on all delinquent 
accounts, including sewer, water, solid waste and stormwater. 
(2) ?The water turn-on fee of forty dollars ($40.00), and an additional one hundred dollars ($100.00) 
if an employee must be called in after hours, as described in section 22-12. Fees for restarting 
solid waste service is as described in chapter 13, as applicable. 
(3) ?All deposits for water, solid waste and sewer services, as applicable, shall be restored to 
required amounts if these deposits were previously applied against delinquent accounts, 
including increasing required deposits, as appropriate, as described above. 
(4) ?When service has been disconnected at the main by the city, an additional fee equal to the 
meter size tap and set fee shall be charged. 
(f) ?In the event the account holder is also the property owner and shall fail to pay the full amount due, 
following ninety (90) days from the invoice date a notice of lien in favor of the City of Oakland Park 
may be recorded in the Official Records of Broward County, Florida. The notice of lien shall contain a 
sworn statement showing the amount and date of said invoice and the legal description of the 
property against which the lien is assessed. The recordation of the notice of lien shall constitute a 
lien and privilege on the property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in 
principal, interest, and penalties, plus costs of court, if any, until final payment is made. The amount 
due shall bear interest at the legal rate beginning from the date of the assessment of the lien. The 
notice of lien, as recorded in the Official Records of Broward County, shall be prima facie evidence of 
the debt to the City of Oakland Park and may be foreclosed as mortgages are foreclosed in the 
circuit court. 
(g) ?Sewer invoice adjustments may be authorized under the following circumstances. 
(1) ?Should water consumption of an unusually large volume be recorded by an accurate meter, 
which consumption is the result of a leak in the consumer's water system, and such 
consumption results in a loss of water which does not enter the sewer system, the director, 
upon receipt of a sworn affidavit from the customer stating that the water did not enter the sewer 
system and a sworn affidavit from a licensed plumber that a leak in the customer's water system 
has been repaired, may authorize reducing sewer fees by the amount determined by the city to 
be attributable to the leak. 
(2) ?When a signed statement by a contractor having a valid occupational license or property owner 
is provided to the city giving the dimensions and volume in gallons of a pool that has been filled, 
reduction of sewer fees attributable to the filling of the pool is authorized providing more than 
seventy-five (75) percent of the water is replaced and providing that the reduced sewer fees are 
not less than the average sewer fees normally incurred by the customer.

such material received in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the 
limits established by the director for such materials. 
(6) ?Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-producing substances, in such 
concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the director as necessary, after 
treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other 
public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters. 
(7) ?Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits 
established by the director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(8) ?Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5. 
(9) ?Materials which exert or cause: 
a. ?Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, fuller's earth, 
lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium 
chloride and sodium sulfate). 
b. ?Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable-tanning 
solutions). 
c. ?Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to 
constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works.

the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree 
that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having 
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(b) ?If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, 
which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (a) 
above, and which in the judgment of the director, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewerage 
works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or 
constitute a public nuisance, the director may: 
(1) ?Reject the wastes. 
(2) ?Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers. 
(3) ?Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge. 
(4) ?Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by 
existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of section 15-71.

the Examination of Water and Waste Water," published by the American Public Health Association, and 
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control 
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be 
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building 
sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of 
constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and 
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all 
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but 
not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all 
outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.)

concerns and crowd control problems when such activities are conducted on or near public streets 
which are in use by vehicular traffic because these activities involve the process of a person 
requesting a donation or responding to solicitation from an occupant or operator of a vehicle which is 
in traffic, that vehicle occupant or operator must consider the request or solicitation, and, if the 
vehicle occupant or operator decides to fulfill the request, that person must reach for a wallet, search 
for money, or write a check, all while that person and vehicle are located on a public street in use by 
vehicular traffic. Based on the foregoing, the city commission finds that the activity of begging, 
panhandling, soliciting or selling from or to occupants or operators of vehicles located on streets in 
use by vehicular traffic distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and potential hazards 
in the road, observe all traffic signals or warnings and move through the city's streets and 
intersections in a lawful and safe manner and creates a potential safety hazard and poses a 
substantial risk to the public, particularly pedestrians, and impedes the free flow of traffic on the 
streets within the city resulting in the delay and obstruction of the public's free flow of travel on the 
city's streets. The city commission further finds that the safety of beggars, panhandlers, solicitors, 
individuals selling items, pedestrians and operators and occupants of vehicles is at significant risk 
when such activities occur because the nature of these activities often entails beggars, panhandlers, 
solicitors, or individuals selling items by standing on traffic medians, bicycle paths and public streets 
and right of way in use by vehicular traffic, property only meant for the use and control of vehicular 
traffic and not begging, panhandling, soliciting or the sale of items. 
(b) ?It is not the purpose and intent of this article to prohibit begging, panhandling, soliciting or selling 
items in public areas when such activities will not interfere with vehicular traffic and cause traffic 
safety and traffic flow concerns or when such activities will not otherwise cause any public health, 
welfare and safety concerns. 
(c) ?This law is timely and appropriate because current city ordinances are insufficient to address the 
aforementioned problems. The restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are 
narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest. Moreover, this article only restricts 
begging, panhandling, soliciting and the sale of items in certain public places while preserving ample 
alternative areas for the valid exercise of First Amendment constitutional rights. Furthermore, in 
enacting this ordinance, the city commission recognizes the availability of community service and 
other sentencing alternatives, which may be appropriate remedies for violations of this article. 
(d) ?The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to beg, 
panhandle or solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity or any 
lawful activity permitted pursuant to the Florida Statutes. Its goal is instead to provide for pedestrian 
safety and protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of begging, 
panhandling or solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city, 
and to prohibit aggressive begging, panhandling and solicitation in certain public places based upon 
significant governmental interests.

19-13) 


Sec. 17-2. - Pedestrian safety. 
(a) ?Purpose. The city commission also finds that any person who intentionally blocks the passage of 
another person or a vehicle, which requires another person to take evasive action to avoid physical 
contact, constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. The city 
commission further finds that any person who begs, panhandles or solicits under circumstances 
where the person being solicited cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct constitutes a 
threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. The city commission also finds that any 
person begging, panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles while such 
vehicles are on the portion of a public street currently in use by vehicular traffic and any person 
begging, panhandling or soliciting on traffic medians, bicycle paths or publics streets when such 
property is in use by vehicular traffic poses a threat to public safety and prevents the free flow of 
traffic on public streets. 
(b) ?Definitions. Except where the content otherwise requires, as used in this chapter: 
(1) ?Aggressively beg, panhandle or solicit means any request made in person for a donation of 
money or some other article of value from another person by an unwanted touching, detaining, 
impeding or intimidation. 
(2) ?Beg, panhandle or solicit means any request made in person for a donation of money or some 
other article of value, either by words, bodily gestures, signs or other means, from another 
person or to another person. 
(3) ?Beg, panhandle, solicit or offer to sale to or from any operator or occupant of a vehicle that is in 
traffic on a public street or to make an offer to sale any item or provide a service of any nature 
to any operator or occupant of a vehicle that is in traffic on a public street means any request 
made in person for a donation of money or some other article of value or an offer to sale an item 
or provide a service for value, either by words, bodily gestures, signs or other means, from any 
operator or occupant of a vehicle, coupled with an actual exchange of money or some other 
article of value between the person begging, panhandling or soliciting and any operator or 
occupant of a vehicle while that vehicle is on the portion of a public street currently in use by 
vehicular traffic. 
(4) ?Obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic means to walk, stand, sit, lie or place an object in such a 
manner as to block passage of another person or a vehicle, or to require another person or 
driver of a vehicle to take evasive action to avoid physical contact. Acts authorized as an 
exercise of one's constitutional right to picket or to legally protest, are not included within the 
definition of this term. 
(5) ?Beggar, panhandler or solicitor means any person traveling either by foot, vehicle or other 
conveyance, from place to place, requesting in person a donation of money or some other 
article of value, either by words, bodily gestures, signs or any other means, from another 
person. 
(c) ?Restrictions and requirements. 
(1) ?Beggars, panhandlers or solicitors are prohibited from obstructing pedestrian or vehicular traffic 
and aggressively begging, panhandling, soliciting or offering to sell any items on any state road 
located in the City of Oakland Park and any road in Oakland Park that joins a state road. 
(2) ?Beggars, panhandlers or solicitors are prohibited from begging, panhandling or soliciting from 
any operator or occupant of a vehicle that is in traffic on a public street. 
(3) ?No person shall stand on a traffic median, bicycle path, public street, or right of way to beg, 
panhandle, solicit or sale items when in use by vehicular traffic.

Chapter 18 - RESIDENTIAL TRAFFIC CALMING AND STREET CLOSURES[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. O-2000-022, § 2, adopted Nov. 1, 2000, amended Ch. 18 of this Code in its 
entirety to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, Ch. 18, §§ 18-1—18-5, pertained to residential 
street modification and derived from Ord. No. O-92-2, § 2, adopted Feb. 5, 1992. 
Cross reference— Street, sidewalk and subdivision standards, § 24-93 et seq. 


Sec. 18-1. - Purpose. 
    The procedures outlined herein for administering, evaluating, and implementing applications for 
residential traffic calming and street closures apply to the proposed modification of local streets within 
residential neighborhoods submitted by a neighborhood group. It has been found that limiting traffic 
through residential neighborhoods alleviates traffic congestion, reduces excessive noise, trash and 
refuse, reduces traffic conditions hazardous to the health, safety and welfare of persons within residential 
neighborhoods and helps to limit the opportunity for criminal activity within the neighborhood, all factors 
which contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods within the city. 
    The procedures set forth herein are intended to apply only for residential local streets and are not 
intended to cover the following: 
(1) ?The modification of any arterial street, a county collector road or state highway; 
(2) ?The modification of local streets within other than a residential neighborhood. 
    This section is not intended to limit the city commission from authorizing the implementation of any 
street closure and traffic calming within the city boundaries upon its own initiative for the health, safety 
and welfare of the public in accordance with such procedures it so adopts. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-022, § 2, 11-1-00) 


Sec. 18-2. - Definitions.

is twenty-five (25) miles per hour. 
    Neighborhood group: A group of residents or homeowners, or condominium association residing or 
located within the City of Oakland Park. 
    Neighborhood traffic committee (N.T.C.): Committee consisting of a member of the city's public 
works department, Broward Sheriff's Office, city manager's office, community development department, 
and a traffic engineer or traffic planner. Its duty is to review all proposals for the installation of traffic 
calming techniques requested by a neighborhood group and provide its written recommendation to the 
city commission. 
    Public service vehicle: Those vehicles which are used to provide services to the general public. The 
services which are provided utilizing such vehicles shall include but not be limited to fire police, medical 
emergency, postal services, utilities, and sanitary services. 
    Residential neighborhood: A contiguous or nearly contiguous area or areas containing local streets 
where more than fifty (50) percent of the land is used for residential purposes. 
    Speed tables: A speed hump designed with a flat surface and two sloped sides. May be constructed 
with textured material such as pavers or stamped concrete to improve its appearance and serve as a 
raised pedestrian crosswalk. 
    Temporary street closure: The temporary closure of a local street, whereas, a section of the street is 
closed to through traffic by means of a treatment acceptable to the city commission for not less than one 
hundred eighty (180) days as a trial period. 
    Traffic calming: The combination of mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of 
motor vehicle traffic use such as cut through traffic, to alter driver behavior and improve conditions for 
pedestrian and other non-motorized street users. 
    Traffic calming techniques: A "toolbox" of techniques which may be employed to reduce vehicular 
speed on residential street, i.e: speed tables, roundabouts, and channelization are examples. 
    Traffic speed and volume study: An appraisal of traffic conditions and the development of a plan for 
implementing traffic calming techniques.

use of a computer terminal available to the public. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.03, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-74. - Notice by publication.

Sec. 20-76. - Adoption of final assessment resolution. 
    At the public hearing as noticed pursuant to sections 20-74 and 20-75 hereof, or to which an

(3) ?Establish a maximum assessment rate that may be imposed in the event such rate was 
adopted; 
(4) ?Approve the initial assessment roll, with such amendments as it deems just and right; and 
(5) ?Determine the method of collection. The adoption of the final assessment resolution by the city 
commission shall constitute a legislative determination that all parcels assessed derive a special 
benefit from the fire rescue services, facilities, or programs to be provided or constructed and a 
legislative determination that the fire rescue assessments are fairly and reasonably apportioned 
among the properties that receive the special benefit. All written objections to the final 
assessment resolution shall be filed with the city manager at or before the time or adjourned 
time of such hearing. The final assessment resolution shall constitute the annual rate resolution 
for the initial fiscal year in which fire rescue assessments are imposed or reimposed hereunder. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.06, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-77. - Effect of final assessment resolution. 
    The fire rescue assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the final 
assessment resolution. The adoption of the final assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of 
the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair 
apportionment to the assessed property; the method of apportionment and assessment; the initial rate of 
assessment; the maximum assessment rate, if any; the initial assessment roll; and the levy and lien of the 
fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to 
secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the city commission action on the final assessment 
resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the final assessment resolution, shall be delivered 
to the tax collector, as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method 
described in section 20-102 hereof is used to collect the fire rescue assessments, such other official as 
the city commission by resolution shall designate. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.07, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-78. - Adoption of annual rate resolution. 
(a) ?The city commission shall adopt an annual rate resolution during its budget adoption process for 
each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which a fire rescue assessment is imposed 
hereunder. 
(b) ?The initial proceedings for the adoption of an annual rate resolution shall be the adoption of a 
preliminary rate resolution by the city commission: 
(1) ?Containing a brief and general description of the fire rescue services, facilities, or programs to 
be provided; 
(2) ?Determining the fire rescue assessed cost to be assessed for the upcoming fiscal year; 
(3) ?Establishing the estimated assessment rate for the upcoming fiscal year;

b. ?Provide notice by publication and first class mail to affected owners in the event 
circumstances described in subsection (f) of this section so require; and 
c. ?Directing and authorizing any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary 
or convenient by the city. 
(c) ?The annual rate resolution shall: 
(1) ?Establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; and 
(2) ?Approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year with such adjustments as the city 
commission deems just and right. The assessment roll shall be prepared in accordance with the 
method of apportionment set forth in the initial assessment resolution, or any subsequent 
preliminary rate resolution, together with modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed 
in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(d) ?Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from providing annual notification to all owners of 
assessed property in the manner provided in sections 20-74 and/or 20-75 hereof or any other 
method as provided by law. 
(e) ?The city commission may establish or increase a maximum assessment rate in an initial 
assessment resolution or preliminary rate resolution and confirm such maximum assessment rate in 
the event notice of such maximum rate assessment has been included in the notices required by 
section 20-74 and 20-75 hereof. 
(f) ?In the event (1) the proposed fire rescue assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the rates of 
assessment adopted by the city commission including a maximum assessment rate, if any, that were 
listed in the notices previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 20-
74 and 20-75 hereof, (2) the purpose for which the fire rescue assessment is imposed or the use of 
the revenue from the fire rescue assessment is substantially changed from that represented by 
notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 20-74 and 20-75 
hereof, (3) assessed property is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised or altered 
resulting in an increased fire rescue assessment from that represented by notice previously provided 
to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 20-74 and 20-75 hereof, or (4) an 
assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved 
for the prior fiscal year, notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of 
such assessed property as provided by law. Such notice shall substantially conform with the notice 
requirements set forth in sections 20-74 and 20-75 hereof and inform the owner of the date, time, 
and place for the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such 
notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release 
or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the city commission 
pursuant to this article. 
(g) ?As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll approved by the adoption of the 
final assessment resolution or a prior year's annual rate resolution, the adoption of the succeeding 
annual rate resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such assessed 
property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to 
the assessed property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate of assessment, the 
establishment or increase of a maximum assessment rate, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien 
of the fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent 
jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the city commission action on the 
annual rate resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the finality 
of any fire rescue assessment not challenged within the required twenty-day period for those fire 
rescue assessments previously imposed against assessed property by the inclusion of the assessed 
property on an assessment roll approved in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent 
annual rate resolution. 
(h) ?The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the tax 
collector as required by the uniform assessment collection act, or if the alternative method described 
in section 20-102 hereof is used to collect the fire rescue assessments, such other official as the city 
commission by resolution shall designate. If the fire rescue assessment against any property shall be 
sustained, reduced, or abated by the court, an adjustment shall be made on the assessment roll. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.08, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-79. - Lien of fire rescue assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all fire rescue assessments shall constitute a lien against 
assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes 
and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all 
other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid. The lien for a fire rescue assessment shall be 
deemed perfected upon the city commission's adoption of the final assessment resolution or the annual 
rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior 
January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a fire rescue 
assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 20-102 shall be 
deemed perfected upon the city commission's adoption of the final assessment resolution or the annual 
rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.09, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-80. - Revisions to fire rescue assessments. 
    If any fire rescue assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part 
annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that any 
such fire rescue assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or 
if the city commission has failed to include or omitted any property on the assessment roll, which property 
should have been so included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire 
rescue assessment against any property benefited by the fire rescue assessed costs, following as nearly 
as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second fire rescue assessment is 
annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city commission may obtain and impose other fire rescue 
assessments until a valid fire rescue assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.10, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-81. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire rescue 
assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval 
thereof, and any fire rescue assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence 
that such fire rescue assessment was duly levied, that the fire rescue assessment was duly made and 
adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such fire rescue assessment were duly had, taken, 
and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held 
material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.11, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-82. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a) ?No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, city 
commission, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for 
payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the city commission under the provision of this 
article. 
(b) ?When it shall appear that any fire rescue assessment should have been imposed under this article 
against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or 
programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll; or such property was 
erroneously assessed; or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the 
effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal 
year, the city commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the 
omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section 20-75, impose 
the applicable fire rescue assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is 
discovered, in addition to the applicable fire rescue assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. 
Such fire rescue assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and 
dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and 
superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against 
the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in Division 3 hereof, and shall be deemed 
perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(c) ?Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her 
own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a fire 
rescue assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial 
evidence, and correct any error in applying the fire rescue assessment apportionment method to any 
particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no 
way affect the enforcement of the fire rescue assessment imposed under the provisions of this 
article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections 
shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and not the property appraiser or tax 
collector. 
(d) ?After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in 
accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon 
timely written request and direction of the city manager. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 2.12, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-83. - Interim assessments. 
    An interim fire rescue assessment may be imposed against all property for which a certificate of 
occupancy is issued after the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim fire rescue 
assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the annual rate 
for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year for which the 
interim fire rescue assessment is being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full 
calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim fire rescue 
assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire rescue assessment. 
Issuance of the certificate of occupancy without the payment in full of the interim fire rescue assessment 
shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim fire rescue 
assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy may be collected pursuant 
to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in section 20-101, under the alternative collection 
method provided in section 20-102 or by any other method authorized by law. Any interim fire rescue 
assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and 
shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity 
with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank 
and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property 
involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

DIVISION 3. - COLLECTION AND USE OF FIRE RESCUE ASSESSMENTS 


Sec. 20-101. - Method of collection. 
(a) ?Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the fire rescue assessments shall be collected 
pursuant to the uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall 
comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or 
notice required by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act or other provision of law. 
(b) ?The amount of a fire rescue assessment to be collected using the uniform method pursuant to the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an 
amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior 
year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided: 
(1) ?The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the 
use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(2) ?Notice is provided to the owner as required under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and 
(3) ?Any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to 
such fire rescue assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by 
the city. 
(Ord. No. O-2001-034, § 3.01, 11-14-01) 


Sec. 20-102. - Alternative method of collection. 
    In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city commission may elect to collect the 
fire rescue assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative 
collection method provided by this section: 
(1) ?The city commission shall provide fire rescue assessment bills by first class mail to the owner 
of each affected parcel of property that is subject to the fire rescue assessment. The bill or 
accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
a. ?A brief explanation of the fire rescue assessment; 
b. ?A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire rescue 
assessment; 
c. ?The number of units contained within the parcel; 
d. ?The total amount of the fire rescue assessment imposed against the parcel for the 
appropriate period; 
e. ?The location at which payment will be accepted; 
f. ?The date on which the fire rescue assessment is due; and 
g. ?A statement that the fire rescue assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property 
equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and 
other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2) ?The city commission shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent fire rescue 
assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or 
appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. A fire rescue 
assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date 
payment was due, as identified in accordance with paragraph (1)f. of this section. The city 
commission or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or 
her fire rescue assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. 
Such notice shall state in effect that the city commission or its agent will either (i) initiate a 
foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a 
delinquent fire rescue assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure 
of mortgages on real property, or (ii) cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire rescue 
assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(3) ?All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, 
related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or 
decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the 
purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city commission or its agent may join in one 
(1) foreclosure action the collection of fire rescue assessments against any or all property 
assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is 
foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred 
by the city commission and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such 
delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city commission as a 
result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of 
or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(4) ?In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent fire rescue assessment and the costs, fees and expenses 
attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
provided however, that (i) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act and this article, and (ii) any existing lien of record on the affected 
parcel for the delinquent fire rescue assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from 
certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(5) ?Notwithstanding the city commission's use of an alternative method of collection, the city 
manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided 
to him or other city officials in section 20-82 hereof. 
(6) ?Any city commission action required in the collection of fire rescue assessments may be by 
resolution.

assessment is due. 
(b) ?Fire rescue assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as 
all other fire rescue assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early 
payment. 
(c) ?A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the 
date payment was due, as identified in paragraph (1)f. of this section. The city commission shall 
notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its fire rescue 
assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state 
that the city commission will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel 
payment. 
(d) ?All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related 
to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree 
rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other 
appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and 
expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire 
rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city commission as a result of such 
delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, 
the costs of the action. 
(e) ?As an alternative to the foregoing, a fire rescue assessment imposed against government property 
may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in periodic 
installments with a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The city commission 
may contract for such billing services with any utility, whether or not such utility is owned by the city.

    The city commission hereby declares: 
(1) ?Pursuant to Article VIII, section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and sections 166.021 and 166.041, 
Florida Statutes, the city commission has all powers of local self-government to perform 
municipal functions and to render municipal services except when prohibited by law, and such 
power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of city ordinances. 
(2) ?The city commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a 
municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city commission may 
legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects 
described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3), Florida Statutes. The subject matter of 
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3), Florida Statutes, are not relevant to the 
imposition of assessments related to solid waste and recyclable materials collection and 
disposal services, facilities or programs of the city. 
(3) ?The purpose of this article is to: 
a. ?Provide procedures and standards for the imposition of annual solid waste service 
assessments under the general home rule powers of a municipality to impose special 
assessments; 
b. ?Authorize a procedure for the funding of solid waste and recyclable materials collection and 
disposal services, facilities, or programs providing special benefits to property within the 
city; and 
c. ?Legislatively determine the special benefit provided to assessed property from the provision 
of solid waste and recyclable materials collection and disposal services by the city. 
(4) ?The existence of any building or other improvement on improved property results in such 
property generating solid waste or recyclable materials or being capable of generating solid 
waste or recyclable materials. 
(5) ?Whether imposed throughout the entire city or a portion thereof, the imposition of a recurring 
annual solid waste service assessment is an alternative, equitable and efficient method to fairly 
and reasonably apportion and recover the solid waste and recyclable materials collection, 
management and disposal costs experienced by the city among the parcels of residential 
property within the area assessed. 
(6) ?The use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection 
Act provides a mechanism to equitably and efficiently collect solid waste service assessments, 
as well as address payment delinquencies and recover unpaid fees, charges, or assessments 
advanced for solid waste management and disposal services, programs, and facilities allocable 
to specific parcels of assessed property. 
(7) ?The annual solid waste service assessments to be imposed pursuant to this article shall 
constitute non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and intent of the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act. 
(8) ?The solid waste service assessment imposed pursuant to this article is imposed by the city 
commission, not the Broward County Board of County Commissioners, property appraiser or tax 
collector. Any activity of the property appraiser or tax collector under the provisions of this article 
shall be construed as ministerial.

furnished by the city possess a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of residential 
property by providing: (1) the required use of solid waste and recyclable materials collection and 
disposal services, facilities, and programs by the owners and occupants of residential property 
to properly, safely, and cost effectively dispose of solid waste and recyclable materials 
generated on such property, (2) better service to owners and tenants, (3) the enhancement of

and disposal services and programs furnished by or through the city to residential property

Sec. 20-179. - Lien of solid waste service assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all solid waste service assessments shall constitute a lien 
against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal 
taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in 
dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid. The lien for a solid waste service 
assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city commission of the final assessment 
resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a solid waste service 
assessment collected under the uniform assessment collection method shall attach to the property 
included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed 
under the tax roll. The lien for a solid waste service assessment collected under the alternative method of 
collection provided in section 20-202 shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city commission of 
the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to 
the property on such date of adoption.

Sec. 20-180. - Revisions to solid waste service assessments. 
    If any solid waste service assessment made under the provisions of this artilce is either in whole or in 
part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that 
any such solid waste service assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or 
collected, or if the city commission has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should 
have been so included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new solid waste 
service assessment against any property benefited by the solid waste costs, following as nearly as may 
be practicable, the provisions of this artaicle and in case such second solid waste service assessment is 
annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city commission may obtain and impose other solid waste service 
assessments until a valid solid waste service assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-024, § 2.10, 7-20-05) 


Sec. 2-181. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any solid waste 
service assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the 
approval thereof, and any solid waste service assessment as finally approved shall be competent and 
sufficient evidence that such solid waste service assessment was duly levied, that the solid waste service 
assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such solid waste 
service assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this ordinance; and no variance 
from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting 
was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any party objecting to a 
solid waste service assessment imposed pursuant to this ordinance must file an objection with a court of 
competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-024, § 2.11, 7-20-05) 


Sec. 2-182. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a) ?No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, city 
clerk, city commission, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any 
obligation for payment of a solid waste service assessment imposed by the city commission under 
the provision of this article. 
(b) ?When it shall appear that any solid waste service assessment should have been imposed under this 
ordinance against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of solid waste collection 
and disposal services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the 
assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective 
date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the 
city commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted parcel 
in the manner and form provided in section 20-175, impose the applicable solid waste service 
assessment for the fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable solid 
waste service assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years. Such solid waste service 
assessment shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all 
state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity 
to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, 
shall be collected as provided in Division 3 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of 
adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(c) ?Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her 
own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a solid 
waste service assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and 
substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the solid waste service assessment 
apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of 
notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered 
valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the solid waste service assessment 
imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such 
changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and 
not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(d) ?After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in 
accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon 
timely written request and direction of the city manager. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-024, § 2.12, 7-20-05) 


Sec. 20-183. - Interim assessments. 
    An interim solid waste service assessment shall be imposed against all property for which a 
certificate of occupancy is issued after adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim 
solid waste service assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 
) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal 
year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full 
calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim solid waste service 
assessment shall also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's solid waste service 
assessment. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the interim solid waste 
service assessment is received by the city. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy by mistake or 
inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the interim solid waste service assessment, shall not 
relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such 
interim solid waste service assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of 
occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be 
equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special 
assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to 
or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of 
occupancy.

recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that 
individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(c) ?The city shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent solid waste service assessments

of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney 
fees and title search expenses, in collection of such delinquent solid waste service assessments and 
any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent solid waste service assessments 
and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action.

expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
provided however, that (1) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act and this article, and (2) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel 
for the delinquent solid waste service assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from 
certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector.

same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or her or other county

Code, hence codification herein as Div. 2, §§ 21-49—21-55, is at the editor's discretion. 


Sec. 21-49. - Authority of public safety director to install, operate and maintain parking meters. 
(a) ?The public safety director is hereby authorized to install or have installed sufficient parking meters in 
such parking meter zones as now exist or may from time to time be authorized by resolution of the 
city commission of the City of Oakland Park, Florida. Such parking meters shall be placed upon the 
curb alongside of or next to individual parking places to be designated as hereinafter provided. Each 
parking meter shall be so set as to show for display a signal that the parking space assigned to it is, 
or is not, in use. 
(b) ?The public works director shall provide for the installation, regulation, control, operation and use of 
the parking meters provided for herein and shall see to it that such meters are maintained in good 
workable condition. Each parking meter shall be so set as to display a signal indicating the amount of 
time for which parking is allowed upon the deposit of a coin of the United States of America. 
    Each meter shall when properly set as hereinafter provided for, continue in operation from the 
time of depositing such coin until the expiration of the period fixed herein as the parking limits for the 
part of the parking meter zone upon which such meter is placed. Each parking meter shall also be so 
arranged that upon the expiration of such parking limits it will indicate by mechanical operation and 
proper signal that the lawful parking periods have expired. 
(c) ?The public works director shall determine whether additional parking meter zones upon the streets, 
boulevards and avenues of this city are needed or whether existing meters may be removed, as may 
be required from time to time with the approval of the city commission of the City of Oakland Park. 
Parking meters for additional parking meter zones shall be installed, as provided in this section, after 
purchase approved by the city commission.

Oakland Park, Florida the removal of parking meters and the substitution of an attendant cashier to 
collect charges for parking on city-owned or -operated parking lots. Upon enactment of an

parking meter, the owner, operator, manager or driver of such vehicle shall, upon entering the 
parking space, immediately deposit the proper coin in the parking meter alongside of, next to, or in 
front of the parking space, and shall set the meter in accordance with the instructions contained 
thereon. The parking space may then be used by such vehicle during the parking limits provided 
herein. If the vehicle shall remain parked in such parking space beyond the period allowed for the 
deposit of such coin, the parking meter shall display a sign indicating illegal parking, and in that 
event such vehicle shall be considered parked overtime. The parking of a vehicle overtime in any 
such part of a street where any such meter is located shall be a violation of this section. 
(b) ?It shall be unlawful for any person to cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in his 
name, or under his control, to be parked overtime or beyond the lawful periods of time as above set 
forth.

Sec. 21-51. - Presumption of overtime parking and ownership of vehicle. 
(a) ?The fact that the time device on any parking meter is not in operation shall be presumptive evidence 
that the person who parked the vehicle then found standing in the parking space adjacent to such 
meter failed to deposit a coin as required therein, or has permitted his vehicle to remain in such 
parking space for a period of time greater than that permitted for the coin deposited. The indication 
by such meter of illegal parking shall be presumptive evidence of overtime parking. 
(b) ?Any parking violation under this section shall raise the presumption that the vehicle involved was 
operated by the person in whose name such vehicle was registered. 
(Ord. No. O-77-12, § 16, 8-17-77) 


Sec. 21-52. - Time limit and rate for curb parking meters.

parking vehicles in the parking meter zones, and to cover the cost of purchase, supervision, protection, 
installation, operation, maintenance, control and use of parking meters described herein, and repairs and 
painting of signs on streets adjacent thereto. All monies so received shall be used to pay cost of operation 
and supervision, with any balance to be paid into the general fund, as appropriate.

Sec. 22-8.1. - Purchased Water Pass Through Adjustment (PWPTA). 
(1) ?The PWPTA is a volumetric charge based on the cost of water purchased by the city from the City 
of Fort Lauderdale or any other wholesale supplier. The pass-through charge will be applied to all 
billable potable water consumption. 
(2) ?Determination of charge. The city shall calculate the pass-through adjustment and implement any 
changes in the charge consistent with the effective date of any change in the cost of purchased 
water as billed by the city from the City of Fort Lauderdale or any other wholesale water supplier. 
The city may implement the pass-through charge during any portion of the fiscal year as a result of 
material events, which may affect the financial condition of the utility system. Such material events 
may include, but not be limited to: (i) a rate adjustment enacted by the City of Fort Lauderdale or any 
other wholesale water supplier; (ii) implementation of an unforeseen surcharge or additional billing 
adjustment by the City of Fort Lauderdale or any other wholesale supplier. 
(3) ?The PWPTA shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula: 
PWPTA = ((BC × M) + (UC × BU)) × (1+T) / WS 
PWPTA 
= 
The purchased water pass-through charge expressed on a dollars per thousand gallons basis 
which is to be added to each water consumption block or usage charge that is currently in 
effect as of the date of the pass-through application. 
BC 
= 
The per unit change in any base costs or charges that are billed by any wholesale water 
supplier to the city through a large user or similar agreement that is not based on metered 
water consumption measured at the point of delivery between the wholesale water supplier 
and the city. 
M 
= 
The number of months in the fiscal year — (12). 
UC 
= 
The per unit change in any usage or volumetric charges that are billed by any wholesale 
water supplier to the city through a large user or similar agreement that is based on metered 
water consumption measured at the point of delivery between the wholesale water supplier 
and the city. 
BU 
= 
The actual billed water usage (consumption) as invoiced by the respective wholesale water 
supplier to the city which is increasing the usage or volumetric rates for service that occurred 
during the city's most recently completed fiscal year expressed in thousands of gallons. 
T 
= 
Any applicable taxes or surcharges which may be imposed upon the city from time to time by 
jurisdictions having regulatory authority which are directly related to the purchases of water 
from the wholesale water suppliers providing potable water to the city on a sales-for-resale 
basis. 
WS 
= 
The actual billed water sales as metered by the city to all classes of customers or users during 
the city's most recently completed fiscal year expressed in thousands of gallons. 
 
(e) ?Where in the judgment of the city manager or designee it appears that the amount of such deposit is 
not sufficient, the city manager may, using his or her discretion, require a deposit equal to twice the 
amount of the largest actual or reasonably anticipated monthly or quarterly bill (however the account 
is billed).

Sec. 22-8.2. - Annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment. 
(1) ?The city will adjust rates every year beginning October, 1 2013 (beginning of fiscal year 2014). The 
annual rate index adjustment should be based on: i) the percentage change in the Consumer Price 
Index for all Urban Areas (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of Labor from July 1 
of the preceding calendar year until June 30 of the current calendar year applied to the level of 
operating expenses as generally defined by commonly accepted accounting principles for the most 
recently completed fiscal year, divided by ii) the total sales revenues from monthly water and sewer 
rates for the most recently completed fiscal year, exclusive of wholesale water and wastewater 
purchases incurred during such fiscal year. 
(2) ?Calculations will be completed by applying the prior fiscal year operating expenses less actual cost 
of purchased water and wastewater equals the "Net Operating Expenses." The Net Operating 
Expenses times the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Areas as 
published by the United States Department of Labor from July 1 of the preceding calendar year until 
June 30 of the current calendar year ("CPI-U") equals the "Index Adjustment Amount." The Index 
Adjustment Amount divided by the prior fiscal year revenues from the sum of the monthly base 
charges and the consumption charges equals the "Price Index Rate Adjustment" (rounded and 
carried to the 1/100 place) to be applied to the applicable water and wastewater monthly user 
charges. The annual index rate adjustment is calculated as follows: 
Fiscal Year Operating Expenses - Cost of Water and Wastewater Purchased = Net Operating 
Expenses 
(Net Operating Expenses) × (CPI-U) = Index Adjustment Amount 
Index Adjustment Amount

Sec. 22-11. - Safe and convenient access to water meters. 
    Tenants, lessees, occupant or owners of premises shall provide safe and convenient access to water 
meters. The area around meter boxes shall be maintained such that meter boxes will at all times be 
readily visible and accessible for reading and servicing without requiring crawling and other extraordinary 
efforts to gain access. All vicious animals shall be confined such that they provide no threat of attack 
when meters are to be read or serviced. 
(1) ?Access to water meter must be maintained so as to provide unobstructed access to city 
employees. Any obstruction due to trees, shrubs, debris, dirt, etc. will be removed by account 
holder. If the city removes obstructions, after notice to the account holder, actual city costs will 
be billed to the account holder on his/her next monthly utility bill. 
(Code 1960, § 20-7; Ord. No. O-74-8, § 2, 5-15-74; Ord. No. O-2003-013, § 2, 11-19-03; Ord. 
No. O-2010-015, § 4 5-5-10) 


Sec. 22-12. - Water service, establishment and discontinuance of service, invoicing and delinquency. 
(a) ?A request for commencement, transfer or termination of water service by the customer requires 
proof of being either an owner of, or tenant at, the service location. 
(b) ?Bills are due when rendered and shall be considered as received by the customer when delivered or 
mailed to the water and sewer service address or such other address as provided in writing by 
customer. Non-receipt of bills by customer shall not release or diminish obligation of customer with 
respect to payment thereof, unless the customer's bills have been returned to the city for incorrect 
addresses. Each invoice shall become delinquent if payment is not received in utility and billing 
services division within twenty-five (25) days after the invoice date. All fees, excluding penalties, that 
remain unpaid at the end of twenty-five (25) days from the invoice date shall be subject to a penalty 
of one and one-half (1.50) percent. If the bill is not paid within forty (40) days of the invoice date, the 
furnishing of water to the delinquent account shall be suspended. When an account remains in 
arrears ninety (90) days from the invoice date, the account will be closed and the existing deposit 
applied to the arrears. Any account holder whose account becomes delinquent shall be subject to all 
laws, federal, state, and local, allowing for the collection of the full amount of the delinquent account 
plus all costs and fees associated with the city's collection efforts. However, nothing contained herein 
shall limit the city's authority to approve "payment plans" for the extended payment of water charges, 
so long as such extended terms are both reasonable and appropriate, in the sole discretion of the 
city, and are based upon customer hardship. 
(c) ?Fees for requests for account history printouts shall be in accordance with section 2-13. 
(d) ?Application of customer payments. When a customer of the city's utilities systems has a combined 
utilities services billing, customer payments will be applied sequentially to water tax, penalties, 
stormwater, solid waste, sewer, other possible services and lastly water. 
(e) ?To re-establish water service after having service suspended due to delinquency, all delinquent 
amounts, fees and deposits as described below for all delinquent accounts (water, sewer, solid 
waste and stormwater) must be paid in full in advance. Upon payment of all required amounts, water 
service will be restored as soon as possible the same or next business day, or, if not possible during 
normal working hours, after normal working hours if the customer elects to pay the after-hours fee 
described below. Required payment amounts include: 
(1) ?All delinquent amounts, including penalties and interest as applicable, on all delinquent 
accounts, including water, sewer, solid waste and stormwater. 
(2) ?The water turn-on fee of forty dollars ($40.00) and an additional one hundred dollars ($100.00) 
if an employee must be called in after hours. 
(3) ?The fee to restore solid waste service, if applicable, as described in chapter 13. 
(4) ?When service has been disconnected at the water main by the city, an additional fee equal to 
the meter size tap and set fee, as described in section 22-5, shall be charged. 
(5) ?The water service deposit, as described in section 22-8, and solid waste service deposit, if 
applicable and as described in chapter 13, shall be restored to required levels if these deposits 
were previously applied against delinquent accounts. 
(f) ?In the event the account holder is also the property owner and shall fail to pay the full amount due, 
following ninety (90) days from the invoice date a notice of lien in favor of the City of Oakland Park 
may be recorded in the Official Records of Broward County, Florida. The notice of lien shall contain a 
sworn statement showing the amount and date of said invoice and the legal description of the 
property against which the lien is assessed. The recordation of the notice of lien shall constitute a 
lien and privilege on the property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in 
principal, interest, and penalties, plus costs of court, if any, until final payment is made. The amount 
due shall bear interest at the legal rate beginning from the date of the assessment of the lien. The 
notice of lien, as recorded in the Official Records of Broward County, shall be prima facie evidence of 
the debt to the City of Oakland Park and may be foreclosed as mortgages are foreclosed in the 
circuit court. 
(g) ?As described in chapter 15, sewer fees are in part based on water consumption. In instances of 
leaks where the lost water does not enter the sewer system and when pools are filled, adjustment to 
sewer fees may be authorized as described below and in section 15-4.5. 
(1) ?Should water consumption of an unusually large volume be recorded by an accurate meter, 
which consumption is the result of a leak in the consumer's water system, and such 
consumption results in a loss of water which does not enter the sewer system, the director or 
designee, upon receipt of a sworn affidavit from the customer stating that the water did not enter 
the sewer system and a sworn affidavit from a licensed plumber that a leak in the customer's 
water system has been repaired, may authorize reducing sewer fees by the amount determined 
by the city to be attributable to the leak. 
a. ?Adjustments shall retroactively apply back to December 1, 2009, on the water portion of the 
utility bill, once the repair is completed following the required affidavits as stated above are 
met. Adjustments will be made based on the customer's previous six-month average water 
consumption (if available) applicable block rate charge in relation to the billed amount of 
water consumption to which the adjustment may be applied, following approval of the 
director or designee. 
(2) ?When a signed statement by a contractor having a valid business tax receipt or by a property 
owner is provided to the city giving the dimensions and volume in gallons of a pool that has 
been filled and the amount of water added to the pool, the water consumption rate attributable 
to filling the pool shall be the upper block rate consistent with the customer's prior six (6) 
months average monthly consumption, providing more than seventy-five (75) percent of the 
water is replaced. Only one adjustment may be made in any twelve-month period. 
(h) ?Collection fee. In the event the city sends a delinquent account to a collection agency for collection, 
a collection fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be added to the account. 
(Code 1960, §§ 8-20.4, 20-8; Ord. No. O-74-8, § 3, 5-15-74; Ord. No. O-83-19, § 5, 8-17-83;

(SFWMD) water restrictions; and ii) ensure that the city maintains the financial and revenue 
sufficiency of its utility system. 
(1) ?The amount of surcharge shall be based on the level of declaration of a Phase I, Phase II, 
Phase III, or Phase IV level of water restrictions as mandated by the South Florida Water 
Management District and billed by the City of Fort Lauderdale and the number of gallons 
generated by the user. 
(2) ?If a declaration of any phase level of water restriction is recognized by the City of Fort

water restriction shall appear on the first utility billing processed on or after the 1st day of the 
following month. 
(3) ?If such declaration is recognized by the City of Fort Lauderdale after the 15th of the month, the 
prescribed surcharge shall appear on the first utility billing on or after the 1st day of the month 
following a thirty-day period after the declaration date. 
(4) ?When a declaration of water restrictions is rescinded by the South Florida Water Management 
District and subsequently recognized by the City of Fort Lauderdale, the prescribed surcharges 
shall be rescinded with the adjustment appearing on the first utility billing issued on or after the 
1st day of the month following the date the declaration is rescinded.

ARTICLE IV. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 


Sec. 24-54. - PUD: Planned unit development district. 
(A) ?Purpose . To permit larger tracts of land under unified control to be planned and developed as a 
whole (as a single operation or an approved series of operations) with a greater amount of flexibility 
by removing some of the detailed restrictions of conventional zoning. Planned unit developments are 
recognized as serving the public interest and are encouraged because they: 
(1) ?Allow diversification of uses, structures and open spaces when not in conflict with existing and 
permitted land uses on abutting properties; 
(2) ?Reduce improvement costs through a more efficient use of land and a smaller network of 
utilities and streets than is possible through application of standards contained in conventional 
land development regulations; 
(3) ?Conserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging the preservation and improvement 
of scenic and functional open space; 
(4) ?Provide maximum opportunity for application of innovative site planning concepts to the 
creation of aesthetically pleasing environments for living on properties of adequate size, shape 
and location; 
(5) ?Insure that development will occur according to limitations of land use, site design, population 
density, building coverage, improvement standards and construction phasing authorized 
through the approval of a master development plan; 
(6) ?Insure that development will occur within the guidelines and intent of the Oakland Park 
Comprehensive Plan. Planned unit developments are equally adaptable to new development, 
redevelopment and conservation of land, water and other city resources. 
(B) ?Definition . A planned unit development is land under unified control, planned and developed as a 
whole in a single development operation or an approved programmed series of development 
operations for dwelling units and related uses and facilities. It may include principal and accessory 
uses and structures substantially related to the character of the development itself and the 
surrounding area of which it is a part. 
(C) ?Unified control . All land included for the purpose of development within a planned unit development 
district shall be under the control of the applicant (an individual, partnership or corporation, or group 
of individuals, partnerships or corporations). The applicant shall present satisfactory legal documents 
to constitute evidence of the unified control of the entire area within the proposed planned unit 
development which shall be certified by the zoning department. 
(D) ?Signed agreement. 
(1) ?The applicant shall agree in writing to proceed with the proposed development according to the 
provisions of these regulations and conditions attached to the rezoning of the land to planned 
unit development; and 
(2) ?To provide agreements, contracts, covenants, deed restrictions and sureties acceptable to the 
city for completion of the development according to the plans approved at the time of rezoning 
to planned unit development and for continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, 
functions and facilities which are not proposed to be provided, operated or maintained at public 
expense; and 
(3) ?To bind their successors in title to any commitments made under the above. All agreements 
and evidence of unified control shall be examined by the planning and zoning board, and no 
rezoning of land to planned unit development classification shall be adopted without a 
certification by the zoning department that such agreements and evidence on unified control 
meet the requirements of these regulations; and 
(4) ?If the developer elects to administer common open space through an association or nonprofit 
corporation, said organization shall conform to the applicable laws of the State of Florida. 
(E) ?Permitted uses . The uses permitted in a planned unit development must be consistent with the 
permitted uses in the residential categories in the Oakland Park Land Use Element as further 
restricted in this chapter. 
(1) ?Requirements for business uses in a planned unit development: 
(a) ?No more than five (5) percent of the total land area may be used for business uses and no 
one contiguous business area shall exceed ten (10) acres. 
(b) ?The business uses in a planned unit development are restricted to the uses permitted in 
the city's Neighborhood Business (NB) Zoning District. 
(c) ?Business uses located in a planned unit development are intended to meet the 
neighborhood shopping and service needs of the planned unit development and not the 
general needs of a surrounding area. Such uses shall be grouped in convenience centers 
designed as integral, harmonious parts of the planned unit development, appropriately 
buffered and screened from residential uses (whether within or without the planned unit 
development) to protect them from unsightliness, noise, odors and other characteristics 
incompatible with residential uses. A convenience center should rarely exceed five (5) 
acres in size (including buffering, building and parking). It should be pedestrian oriented 
and accessible to walkways and bicycle paths. The center should consist of neighborhood 
shopping and personal services consistent with the daily needs of the planned unit 
development. All business uses located in the convenience center shall be internally 
oriented and should be designed so that no store fronts, store signs or advertisements are 
visible from residential areas and that all commercial activities, storage of merchandise, 
equipment and materials (including trash and waste) are within an enclosed building, 
except for live plants that are accessory to a nursery or garden supply facility. 
(d) ?Signs for commercial use in a planned unit development shall meet the requirements of 
article XI. 
(F) ?Land use and design regulations. 
(1) ?Minimum size of planned unit development: All planned unit developments shall contain a 
minimum of ten (10) acres of contiguous land unless the planning and zoning board finds that a 
tract which contains less than ten (10) acres is suitable as a planned unit development by virtue 
of some unusual conditions. This minimum may be waived by the city commission upon the 
recommendation of the planning and zoning board. 
(2) ?Maximum density: The total number of dwelling units permitted in a planned unit development 
shall not exceed the total number of units permitted by; the Oakland Park Future Land Use Map 
for the subject area. 
(3) ?Minimum lot area, distance between structures, frontage and setbacks: 
(a) ?No minimum lot size shall be required within a planned unit development. 
(b) ?No minimum distance between structures shall be required within a planned unit 
development. The appropriate distance between structures shall be evaluated on an 
individual development basis, after considering the type of character of the current 
structure types within a development by the city commission upon recommendation of the 
planning and zoning board. 
(c) ?Each dwelling unit or other permitted use shall have access to a public street either 
directly or indirectly via an approach, private road, pedestrian way, court or other area 
dedicated to public or private use of common easement guaranteeing access. Permitted 
uses are not required to front on a dedicated road. The city shall be allowed access on 
privately owned roads, easements and common open space to insure the police and fire 
protection of the area, to meet emergency needs, to conduct city services and to generally 
insure the health and safety of the residents of the planned unit development. 
(d) ?There are no required setbacks or yards except the following: 
1. ?Internal streets: There shall be a setback of not less than twenty-five (25) feet in depth 
abutting all public road rights-of-way within a planned unit development district.

boundary lines of the planned unit development of not less than twenty-five (25) feet 
in depth. 
(4) ?Maximum length of structures: No maximum length of structures shall be required within a 
planned unit development district. 
(5) ?Maximum height of structures: No maximum height of structures shall be required within a 
planned unit development. The city commission upon recommendation of the planning and 
zoning board shall determine the appropriate height limitations on an individual development 
basis after considering the character of the surrounding area, the character of the proposed 
development, and the goals for community development as stated in the Oakland Park 
Comprehensive Plan. 
(6) ?Minimum floor area requirements: The minimum floor area per dwelling unit shall be as follows:

combined ground area occupied by all principal and accessory buildings shall not exceed 
the weighted average of the applicable building site coverages indicated in (a) above. 
(c) ?If the developer/applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that greater building 
site coverage is desirable due to the character of the proposed development, the character 
of the area surrounding the proposed development, and the city goals and objectives for 
growth and development, the city may allow greater building site coverage than that 
permitted above. 
(8) ?Off-street parking and loading requirements: Off-street parking and loading requirements shall 
meet all the requirements of article VI, except as provided in this section. 
(a) ?If the developer/applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that fewer parking 
spaces are required to adequately serve the residential units within the proposed 
development, the city may require a minimum of one and one-half (1½) parking spaces per 
unit. The remaining one-half (½) parking space per unit shall be provided in adequately 
drained grassed areas that shall not be counted towards meeting the required open space 
standards of this chapter. Grass to be utilized in said areas must be of a durable nature 
and approved by the appropriate city personnel. The grassed area should be clearly 
designated as the parking area and meet all provisions of article VI. If at such time the city

intensifying spaces and routes of movement, identifying space), be native to South Florida, 
and functionally appropriate for shade, shelter, height and mass, texture, color and form. 
Major areas should have distinctive planting schemes using unique type trees, ground 
cover, and paving to give identity to these areas. 
(c) ?All undesirable exotic vegetation, including melaleuca, Brazilian pepper, Australian pine or 
other vegetation deemed undesirable by the Broward County Urban Forester, shall be 
removed by the applicant according to a schedule approved by the city. However, the city 
may allow certain undesirable exotic vegetation to remain at the request of the applicant for 
good cause. 
(10) ?Underground utilities: Within the planned unit development, all utilities including telephone, 
television cable and electrical systems shall be installed underground. 
Primary facilities providing service to the site may be exempted from this requirement. Large 
transformers shall be placed on the ground and contained within pad mounts, enclosures or 
vaults. The developer shall provide adequate landscaping with shrubs and plants to screen all 
utility facilities permitted aboveground. 
(11) ?Open space requirements: A planned unit development shall provide and maintain open 
space at least equal to thirty-five (35) percent of the gross area of the planned unit development 
exclusive of lakes, lagoons or other waterways. In calculating open space, land areas for 
structures, public and private street rights-of-way, driveways, off-street parking and loading 
zones, alleys, fire protection vehicular access and yards and spaces between single-family 
residential buildings shall not be included. Depending upon the characteristics of a planned unit 
development, the city may allow credit for lakes, lagoons or other waterways, such credit not to 
exceed forty (40) percent of the required open space. The required open space shall be 
designed for both active and passive recreational needs acceptable to the city. In planning 
active recreational facilities consideration should be given for the inclusion of swimming pools, 
tennis courts, baseball fields, playgrounds, tot lots, etc. 
(12) ?Internal circulation: An internal pedestrian and bicycle circulation system shall be provided 
within the planned unit development separate from each other and from vehicular circulation 
systems and at a distance sufficient to ensure safety. Such pedestrian and bicycle ways shall 
be surfaced with a durable and dustless material. The city may waive this requirement at the 
request of the applicant for design, safety or other good reasons. 
(13) ?Energy conservation: A planned unit development shall incorporate passive energy 
conservation measures in its site design in accordance with Chapter 13, Florida Building Code. 
Such measures shall include, but need not be limited to, the directional orientation of buildings, 
the location of windows, minimization of radiant heat absorption and the inclusion of energy-
efficient landscaping. 
(14) ?Professional services required: Any plans submitted as a part of a petition for a planned unit 
development shall certify that the services of competent professionals were utilized in the 
designing or planning process and shall state their names and businesses and addresses.

as required by this section in (F)(13). 
    In addition, the planning and zoning board or city commission may require additional 
material such as plans, maps and studies which are needed to make findings and 
determinations that the applicable standards and guidelines have been fully met. 
(2) ?Staff review: Prior to the public hearing before the planning and zoning board, the staff of the 
various city departments concerned with development shall review the application for rezoning 
to planned unit development for adherence to all applicable requirements. As a result of this 
review, the applicant may choose to revise the master development plan prior to the public 
hearing before the planning and zoning board. A revision of this nature shall be permitted at no 
expense to the developer. 
(3) ?Consideration by the planning and zoning board: After the public hearing for rezoning to 
planned unit development, the planning and zoning board shall make its recommendations to 
the city commission. In making its recommendation, the planning and zoning board shall 
evaluate whether the plans, maps and documents submitted by the applicant and presented at 
the public hearing, do or do not meet all the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable 
city ordinances. The board shall also evaluate the suitability of the proposed development in 
terms of its relationship to the comprehensive plan, and the area surrounding the proposed 
development, and to what extent the development is consistent with adopted goals and 
objectives for growth and development. 
(4) ?Consideration by the city commission: Upon the receipt of the recommendations of the 
planning and zoning board, the city commission shall schedule and conduct a public hearing to 
consider the rezoning petition in accordance with normal rezoning procedures. The city 
commission shall evaluate the proposed development in the same manner as required of the 
planning and zoning board. 
(5) ?Conditions and stipulations: In granting approval for a planned unit development, the planning 
and zoning board may recommend and the city commission may attach reasonable conditions, 
safeguards and stipulations made at the time of approval, which shall be binding upon the 
applicant or any successors in interest. 
(I) ?Conformance to approved master development plan. 
(1) ?Permits: After rezoning to planned unit development district, no permits shall be issued by the 
city and no development shall commence unless in conformance with the approved master 
development plan, unless a change or deviation is approved. 
(2) ?Minor change: The city manager, after receiving staff recommendations, may approve "minor" 
changes and deviations from the approved master development plan which are in compliance 
with the provisions and intent of this chapter, and which do not depart from the principal concept 
of the approved master development plan. All other requested changes and deviations shall be 
referred to the city commission. 
(3) ?Intermediate change: The city commission may at the request of the owner, without requiring a 
new application, authorize "intermediate" changes to approved master development plans that 
pertain to location, types and configuration of buildings, landscaping and similar changes when 
the full character and intent of the approved master plan is not violated. This can be done 
without a public hearing and full application. 
(4) ?Substantial change: The city commission may determine that requested changes and 
deviations from an approved master development plan constitute a substantial alteration to the 
character of the development and thus require that the requested changes be subject to the 
same procedures as required for new applications. Substantial changes would include alteration 
of the total density or commercial land use. 
(J) ?Failure to begin planned unit development . If no construction has begun or development taken 
place within eighteen (18) months from the time of rezoning as set out in an affidavit by the proper 
building official, the city commission may initiate a rezoning petition for the property to an appropriate 
zoning classification which will comply with the Future Land Use Map. An extension may be granted 
up to an additional eighteen (18) months by adoption of a resolution by the city commission upon 
written request. 
(K) ?Issuance of building permits . No building permit shall be issued except in conformity with all 
provisions of the rezoning to planned unit development and plans submitted and approved under 
these regulations.

(D) ?Nonconforming uses and structures. 
(1) ?Purpose. It is the purpose of this zoning district to provide for the regulations of nonconforming 
uses and structures which existed lawfully (whether by special exception, variance, or 
otherwise) on the effective date of passage or amendment of this zoning district and which fail 
to conform to any of the applicable regulations contained herein. Nonconforming uses are 
deemed to be: incompatible with and detrimental to permitted uses and structures in the zones 
in which they are located; the cause of disruption of the comprehensive land use patterns of the 
city; an inhibition of present and future development of nearby properties; conferring upon their 
owners and users an absolute franchise and hence a position of unfair advantage. A rigid 
control on expansion and the eventual elimination or reduction to conformity, as expeditiously 
as is reasonable, of nonconforming uses or structures is declared to be as much a subject of 
health, safety and welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would 
violate the provisions of this section. 
(2) ?Nonconforming buildings or structures. Any nonconforming building or structure may be 
continued subject to the following conditions and requirements: 
(a) ?Repairs, alterations and enlargements. Any nonconforming structure may be repaired or 
altered subject to the provisions of this article, provided there is no increase in 
nonconformity. 
(b) ?Restoration. 
1. ?Damage less than fifty (50) percent of restoration cost: If a nonconforming structure is 
damaged by any means to the extent that the cost of restoration would be less than 
fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost of the entire building or structure at the time 
of the damage, such structure may be restored subject to the following provisions: 
a. ?No nonconformity shall be increased beyond its extent prior to the damage. 
b. ?Restoration shall be completed within twelve (12) months after the infliction of the 
damage. 
2. ?Damage or deterioration more than fifty (50) percent of restoration cost: If a 
nonconforming building or structure is damaged or deteriorated by any means to the 
extent that the cost of restoration would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the 
replacement cost of the entire building or structure, it shall not be restored and may be 
replaced only by a conforming building or structure. 
(c) ?Nonconforming uses. Any nonconforming use of a building or land may be continued 
subject to the following conditions and requirements: 
1. ?Expansion. A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land shall not be expanded 
into any other portion of such building, structure or lot occupied by such use. 
2. ?Change. The nonconforming use of a building, structure or land may be changed only 
to a conforming use except as provided. If a nonconforming use of a building, 
structure or land has been changed to a conforming use, it may thereafter be changed 
only to another conforming use. 
3. ?Existing use. Any existing use which is classified as a conditional use in the zone in 
which it is located shall be deemed to have been authorized subject to maintaining the 
existing character and extent of operations and structures. 
4. ?Discontinuance. A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land which has been 
discontinued shall not be returned to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall 
be considered to be discontinued when the premises have been devoted to another 
use or the premises have been vacant for a period of two (2) months. 
5. ?Use discontinuance. Any use existing on the effective date of this zoning district or 
any amendment to it which is classified as a nonconforming use in the zoning 
classification in which it is located shall be terminated by the July 2, 2018. 
Any owner that perceives the year 2018 date to constitute a unique hardship may apply to a 
"nonconforming use amortization board" which is hereby created. The five-person board shall 
be appointed by the city commission and shall include at least one (1) accountant familiar with 
tax and business law, and one (1) architect or builder. All applications for extensions must be 
submitted to the code enforcement officer by January 1, 2016; said applications must be 
accompanied by an appraisal, and a statement of what is unique to this use and structure. No 
extension shall be granted beyond the year 2028.

private, residential and nonresidential properties within the City of Oakland Park and the swale 
areas contiguous to such lands, to provide an environment (including but not limited to) free of 
junk vehicles and trailers, watercraft, vessels and boats, junk, litter, garbage, debris, trash,

(4) ?Require residential and nonresidential property owners of real and personal property to be 
responsible for the costs of removal of junk vehicles and trailers, items, watercraft, vessels and 
boats, litter, garbage, debris, trash, graffiti, abandoned personal property, and overgrown 
groundcover and hedges exceeding the permitted height to avoid blighting influences.

preparation, use, cooking, processing, handling or storage of meats, fish, fowl, fruits, vegetables or 
other organic matter, which is subject to decomposition, decay, putrefaction or the generation of 
noxious or offensive gases or odors, or which during or after decay, may serve as a breeding or 
feeding material for flies, insects or animals. 
    Junk items. Wrecked, dismantled, partially dismantled or discarded items including, but not 
limited to, tires, machinery, appliances, plumbing fixtures, household items, unusable construction 
materials, scrape materials and other similar items which are inoperable, unusable or in deteriorated 
condition. 
    Junk property. Junk items, junk vehicles and trailers, trailers and junk watercraft, vessels and 
boats, as those terms are defined herein. 
    Junk vehicles, trailers, watercraft, vessels and boats. Vehicles, trailers or watercraft, vessels 
and boats which are wrecked, dismantled, partially dismantled or discarded, which are inoperable or 
in a severely deteriorated condition and are not in a movable condition. Parking or storage of a

    Overgrown groundcover. Grass, weeds, and other low-growing plants, except native vegetation, 
that by the nature of their own horizontal growth habits, cover the ground, and which are not 
regularly cared for and maintained, and grow in an unrestricted manner exceeding nine (9) inches in 
height.

not limited to, plywood panels, aluminum panels, steel panels, polycarbonate panels, movable 
awnings, and "accordion shutters." 
    Swale. That portion of a street intended to provide drainage that lies between private property 
(or in the case of a private road, private property lying outside of an ingress/egress easement) and

the open storage or discarding of junks and trailers, watercraft, vessels, boats, junk items, household 
appliances (operable and inoperable) debris, garbage, trash, abandoned personal property, graffiti 
and litter; except in facilities approved by the city for storage or discarding of such items or materials, 
the existence of overgrown groundcover or vegetation, un-maintained buildings and structures within 
the city, and the covering of windows and door openings with storm panels in violation of section 24-
79(E)(7). Such storage, discarding and conditions have been determined by the city commission to 
constitute a public nuisance in that such items create an eyesore to the community, become a 
breeding ground for rats and other vermin, create an attractive nuisance to children, lead to the 
further accumulation of junk, garbage, trash, litter, and debris, and contribute to the deterioration of 
both residential and nonresidential areas. The city commission has further determined, in 
accordance with Florida law, that the failure of a property to contain the quantity of storm water it is 
required to contain by the applicable drainage district standards and Land Development Code (LDC) 
shall constitute a nuisance, in that the premature runoff of storm water onto adjacent properties and 
rights-of-way contributes to flooding conditions which interferes with the enjoyment of property, 
damages structures and vegetation, and impedes the safe use of streets. 
(1) ?The city commission has determined that the removal of overgrown groundcover and hedges, 
junk items, trash, garbage, litter, graffiti, abandoned personal property and debris after providing 
notice to the property owner and a reasonable period of time of ten (10) days in which to 
remove the items is an appropriate means of avoiding blighting influences and furthering the 
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Oakland Park. 
(2) ?The city commission has determined that the removal and destruction of junk vehicles and 
trailers, watercraft, vessels and boats and abandoned personal property from private property 
after the reasonable opportunity for a hearing is an appropriate means of avoiding blighting 
influences and furthering the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens in the city. 
(D) ?Outdoor storage in residential districts. 
(1) ?No residential land use or trailers shall be used for the storage of building materials or 
construction equipment except when incidental to construction operations for which a building 
permit is in effect. 
(2) ?The only items that may be stored by the resident of the subject property in the open air or in a

(1) ?Fractional measurements: When units or measurements determining the number of required 
off-street parking spaces result in requirements of a fractional space, any such fraction shall 
only require a full off-street parking space when the fraction is equal to or greater than exactly 
fifty (50) percent, unless otherwise provided for in this article. 
(2) ?Mixed uses: In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the 
sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately, and off-street parking space 
for one (1) use shall not be considered as providing the required off-street parking for any other 
use. 
(3) ?Measurement: For the purposes of this article, floor area shall mean the gross floor area. In 
hospitals, bassinets shall not count as beds. 
(a) ?For the purpose of calculating parking spaces, gross floor area shall not include: covered 
or enclosed parking areas; exterior unenclosed private balconies; floor space used for 
mechanical equipment for the building; and elevator shafts and stairwells at each floor. 
(b) ?Customer service area. Customer service area is the area of an establishment available 
for food or beverage service or consumption, or both, calculated by measuring all areas 
covered by customer tables and bar surfaces and any floor area within five (5) feet of the 
edge of said tables and bar surfaces, measured in all directions where customer mobility is 
permitted. Customer service area shall include any outdoor or patio floor area used or 
designed for food or beverage service or consumption, or both, measured as specified 
above. Areas between tables or bars which overlap in measurement with another table 
shall only be counted once. 
(c) ?Outdoor casual seating without service. Businesses, institutions, or uses that serve food or 
beverages solely inside and do not provide service outside may have outdoor casual 
seating, such as benches or tables and chairs, without providing any additional parking as 
required for customer service areas if all accessibility standards are met. 
(d) ?Outdoor seating de minimus standard. Businesses, institutions, or uses that serve food or 
beverages may be approved to serve food for outdoor seating by a maximum of two (2) 
tables (with up to eight (8) seats total) in an area no more than one hundred (100) square 
feet without providing any additional parking as required for customer service areas if all 
accessibility standards are met. 
(4) ?Retail shopping center: For the purposes of this article, in the event a more intense use, such 
as but not limited to a restaurant, Places of Worship, Places of Public Assembly or movie 
theater is proposed to occupy more than thirty-three (33) percent of the total gross floor area of 
the shopping center: 
(a) ?The parking requirement shall be calculated based on a total of the minimum number of 
spaces required for such individual use together with the requirement for shopping centers 
for the remaining area of the center; or 
(b) ?City commission approval of a cross parking agreement shall be required in accordance 
with (B) of this section above. 
(E) ?Combined off-street parking . Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent collective 
provision for, or joint use of, off-street parking facilities for two (2) or more buildings or uses by two 
(2) or more owners or operators, provided that the total of such parking spaces, when combined or 
used together shall not be less than the sum of the requirements of the several individual uses 
computed in accordance with this article. 
(F) ?Nonconforming uses . In the case of a building occupied by a use which is not permitted as a new 
use in the district in which such building is located, alterations which exceed fifty (50) percent of the 
current market value shall not be permitted until the off-street parking requirements of this article for 
a new use of this type are fully provided. Also, see section 24-207. 
(G) ?Use of required off-street parking by another building and nonconcurrent parking agreements. 
(1) ?No part of an off-street parking area required for any building or use by this article shall be 
included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use 
unless the type of use indicates that the periods of usage will not overlap or be concurrent with 
each other. 
(2) ?Where two (2) adjoining buildings or uses apply with a plan for parking which otherwise 
satisfies the requirements of this article, they may be permitted to use the same space as long 
as the type of use indicates that the usage will not overlap or be concurrent. Included with the 
application shall be a use agreement or lease between the two (2) parties in recordable form 
which the city shall record at the expense of the applicants. 
(H) ?Backout parking . Backout parking facilities are permitted in R-1 and R-2 Zoning Districts and RM-
16 and RM-25 Zoning Districts where utilized for single-family and duplex structures; and in R-16, R-
25, NB, B-1, B-2, and I-1 Zoning Districts where more than sixty-five (65) percent of the lineal 
footage of the block length consists of businesses or multiple dwellings existing with backout parking 
facilities. Backout parking facilities are prohibited in all other zoning districts. 
    However, regardless of the zoning district, backout parking facilities are prohibited on the 
following streets unless backout parking for a public project has been approved by the controlling

one hundred (100) feet transition shall be constructed at each driveway entrance and 
intersection to adequately accommodate project traffic if either of the following warrants are 
found: 
(a) ?The roadway or intersection does not meet the level of service standards in article XIII: If 
adequate right-of-way is not available, or cannot be made available through dedication for 
the construction of a right turn lane, then a traffic engineer study must be conducted 
showing how additional traffic can be adequately and safely accommodated. 
(b) ?The roadway or intersection meets the level of service in article XIII but the speed limit is 
forty (40) mph or greater: If adequate right-of-way is not available or cannot be made 
available through dedication for the construction of a right turn lane, then a traffic 
engineering study must be conducted showing how additional traffic can be adequately

ARTICLE X. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. O-2013-015, § 2, adopted Oct. 2, 2013, repealed former Art. X, §§ 24-130—24-
134, in its entirety which pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. O-92-21, § 1, 11-4-

6, 9-18-02. 


Sec. 24-130. - General. 
(A) ?Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of 
Oakland Park, Fl., hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
(B) ?Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or 
partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, 
grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, 
enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and 
facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of 
manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of 
recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(C) ?Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction 
requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the 
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding 
through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1. ?Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of 
flooding; 
2. ?Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood 
damage; 
3. ?Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of 
equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion 
potential; 
4. ?Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the 
impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5. ?Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6. ?Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard 
areas; 
7. ?Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response 
to and recovery from flood events; and 
8. ?Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as 
set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
9. ?To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(D) ?Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and 
enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of 
the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(E) ?Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, 
as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and 
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights 
may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside 
of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be 
free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in 
the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 
44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for 
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or

(C) ?Limitations on authority to grant variances . The board of adjustment shall base its decisions on 
variances on technical justifications submitted by applicants, the considerations for issuance in 
subsection 24-136(G) of this ordinance, the conditions of issuance set forth in subsection 24-136(H) 
of this ordinance, and the comments and recommendations of the floodplain administrator and the 
building official. The board of adjustment has the right to attach such conditions as it deems 
necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this ordinance. 
(D) ?Restrictions in floodways. A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a 
floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable 
analyses and certifications required in subsection 24-134(C) of this ordinance. 
(E) ?Historic buildings. A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation 
of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction 
requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 11 Historic Buildings, upon a 
determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's 
continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve 
the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's 
continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any 
repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building 
Code. 
(F) ?Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or 
substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in 
this ordinance, provided the variance meets the requirements of subsection 24-136(D), is the 
minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of 
methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
(G) ?Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the Board of 
Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions 
of the Florida Building Code, this ordinance, and the following: 
1. ?The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or 
damage; 
2. ?The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3. ?The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the 
effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
4. ?The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
5. ?The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk 
of flooding or erosion; 
6. ?The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
7. ?The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain 
management program for the area; 
8. ?The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9. ?The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the 
floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
10. ?The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including 
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water 
systems, streets and bridges. 
Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of the ordinance, the board of 
adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the 
purposes of this article. (NOTE: this needs to be justified with subsection (H) below.) 
(H) ?Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
1. ?Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique 
characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any 
provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
2. ?Determination by the board of adjustment that: 
a. ?Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical 
characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the 
requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b. ?The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to 
public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or 
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c. ?The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3. ?Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in 
the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the 
affected parcel of land; and 
4. ?If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or 
substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a 
written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the 
difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, 
stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk 
resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance 
coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life 
and property.

intensity, site plan and any supplemental conditions approved. Modifications to any of the specifics 
or conditions of the approval is a zoning violation and subject to code enforcement action and/or 
revocation of the conditional use approved. Any proposed modification to the use which affects 
density, intensity or minimum code requirements of the site development plan will require review and 
approval of a minor or major amendment by either the development review committee or city 
commission. 
(1) ?Revisions to approved site plan: 
(a) ?Minor amendment: The development review committee, after receiving staff 
recommendations, may approve "minor" changes and deviations from the approved site 
plan which are in compliance with the provisions and intent of this article, and which do not 
depart from the principal concept of the approved site plan. All other requested changes 
and deviations shall be referred to the city commission. 
(b) ?Major amendment: The city commission may determine that requested changes and 
deviations from an approved site plan constitute a substantial alteration to the character of 
the development and thus require that the requested changes be subject to the same 
procedure as required for new application. Substantial changes would include alteration of 
the intensities, density or modifications to minimum code requirements and approved 
conditions.

ARTICLE XIII. - CONCURRENCY: THE ADEQUACY OF PUBLIC FACILITIES 


Sec. 24-175. - Concurrency standards and procedures. 
(A) ?Public facilities concurrent with development impacts. 
(1) ?The city shall not grant a development permit for a proposed development unless the city has 
determined that public facilities are adequate to serve the needs of the proposed development 
or unless the developer agrees in writing that no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for the 
proposed development until public facilities are adequate to serve its needs as specified in the 
following portions of this article. This shall include the extension of a sanitary sewer and water 
lines to serve the property, if necessary. 
(2) ?A concurrency determination shall be made at the earliest appropriate stage of the 
development permit review process. 
    An application for concurrency review, when required, shall be submitted prior to or simultaneous 
with an application for a development permit. Upon completion of a concurrency review, a determination 
of adequacy or inadequacy for those facilities as provided in [section] 24-175(B) shall be issued. A 
determination of adequacy shall remain valid provided an application for a development permit consistent 
with the application for a concurrency review is submitted within sixty (60) days of issuance of the 
determination and shall remain valid as follows: 
(a) ?For a proposed development requiring development review committee (DRC) review a 
determination of adequacy for all facilities except drainage and traffic shall be issued. A 
determination for traffic shall be issued at the time the DRC review is completed. A 
determination of adequacy shall remain valid provided the required development permit is 
issued within six (6) months of the DRC review and shall remain valid as long as the 
development permit is valid. 
(b) ?For a proposed development requiring site plan approval and not DRC review, a 
determination of adequacy for all facilities except drainage shall be issued. A determination 
of adequacy for drainage shall be issued at the time a complete application for a building 
permit is submitted. A determination of adequacy shall remain valid as long as the site plan 
is approved within six (6) months of submission of an application for site plan approval and 
shall remain valid as long as the site plan approval is valid. 
(c) ?For a proposed development requiring a building permit, a determination of adequacy for 
all facilities except drainage shall be issued. A determination of adequacy of drainage shall 
be issued at the time a complete application for a building permit is submitted. A 
determination of adequacy shall remain valid as long as the building application is under 
review and if a building permit is issued, shall remain valid as long as the building permit is 
valid. 
(d) ?For all other proposed development requiring a development permit, a determination of 
adequacy shall be valid for as long as the development permit is valid. 
(e) ?An application for a development permit must be consistent with the information on which 
the concurrency review was based. If the applicant modifies the intensity or density of the 
proposed development during the development review process a revised application for 
concurrency review may be required. 
(B) ?Applicability of Level of Service Standards . A development permit shall not be approved unless 
there is sufficient available design capacity to sustain the following levels of service as established in 
the City of Oakland Park Comprehensive Plan: 
Public Facility Category 
Local Standard

*?Gallons per capita per day. 
**?"Maintain" means traffic shall not exceed 10% more than the trips on that link plus trips 
"committed" to that link by virtue of development approvals, as of February 21, 1989. 
 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prescribed levels of service do not necessarily have to be met 
during construction of new facilities in a specific area if upon completion of the new facilities the 
prescribed levels of service will be met. 
(C) ?Determination of project impact on thoroughfares . The impact of proposed development activity on 
available traffic design capacity shall be determined as follows: 
(1) ?The area of impact of the development (a traffic shed) shall be determined in accordance with 
Broward County Land Development Code Trafficways Plan criteria. The traffic shed shall be 
that area where the primary impact of traffic to and from the site occurs. If the application is for a 
building permit for a single-family or duplex development, the impact shall be presumed to be 
limited to the collector or arterial serving the local street giving access to the lot, or to the 
collector or arterial giving direct access to the lot. 
(2) ?The projected level of service for arterials and collectors within the traffic shed shall be 
calculated based upon estimated trips to be generated by the project, or where applicable, the 
first phase of the project, and taking into consideration the impact of other approved but not 
completed developments within the traffic shed. 
(D) ?Development subject to concurrency determination . The following development permits shall be 
subject to concurrency review; the review shall occur at the earliest appropriate submittal stage in 
the development permit review process: 
(1) ?All development permits subject to approval by the City of Oakland Park. For development 
permits requested on land platted prior to March 20, 1979, the City of Oakland Park will be 
responsible for making the final concurrency determination. Exceptions to concurrency review 
are as noted in (2) and (3) below. 
(2) ?Traffic concurrency only shall be considered vested or approved for plats approved by Broward 
County between March 20, 1979 and October 1, 1989, assuming there is no replat. Otherwise, 
they shall be subject to concurrency review. 
(3) ?Property which is exempt. Exempt property is limited to: 
(a) ?Development which is authorized by an approved Development of Regional Impact (DRI) 
Development Order. 
(b) ?Development which is found by the city planner to have vested rights with regard to any 
affected roadway segments and/or infrastructure capacity reservations. 
(c) ?Any replacement use which by virtue of its similarity (or lower intensity) to the previous 
type of use, clearly causes no increase in public facility usage; however, any increase in 
parking requirements shall necessitate a concurrency review. 
(d) ?Development of one (1) single-family or duplex dwelling on a lot or parcel of record which 
was in single and separate ownership as of March 1, 1989, shall be exempt if all city 
easement and right-of-way requirements have been met. Any single-family or two-family 
dwelling which is demolished shall be vested if replaced by a similar dwelling within 
eighteen (18) months. The entire City of Oakland Park is considered an infill area. 
(e) ?Development which is a government facility which the Oakland Park City Commission 
finds is essential to the health or safety of persons residing in the city. 
(f) ?Bus stop shelters, landscape features, signs, diminution or demolition of a structure, or 
canal maintenance. 
(E) ?Measurement of facility capacities. 
(1) ?Water and wastewater: Measurement of the capacity of water and wastewater facilities will be 
based on design capacities and flows both serving the site and at the master meter on the 
feeder trunk line. Tables I and II, located at the end of this article, shall be used to calculate 
design flows per unit. 
(2) ?(a)  
Roadways: The standard for determining additional trips shall be a current Broward County 
Office of Planning TRIPS Generation Rate Table. The basis for measuring roadway capacities 
shall be based upon the comprehensive plan traffic tables, a county TRIPS assignment and the 
Florida DOT Table of Generalized Daily Level-of-Service Maximum Volumes. The measurement 
of capacity may also be determined by engineering studies or other data provided that analysis 
techniques are technically sound and acceptable to the Broward County Office of Planning or 
city engineer. 
(b) ?Any developments that are determined to be within or create a compact deferral area may 
have to be reviewed in conjunction with Broward County Office of Planning to determine if 
an action plan can resolve the capacity deficiencies. 
(3) ?Drainage: Measurement of the drainage facilities will be based on the more restrictive of: 
1) ?One (1) foot above the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map Base Flood Elevation; or 
2) ?The 100-Year Flood Elevation as determined by the Broward County 100-year flood criteria 
map; or 
3) ?a)  
Twelve (12) inches above the adjacent road crown for residential development; 
b) ?Six (6) inches above the adjacent road crown for nonresidential development. 
(4) ?Solid waste: Measurement of solid waste shall be based on generation rates shown in Table III, 
located at the end of this article, and the design capacity of the landfill. 
(5) ?Recreation: Measurement shall be based on the latest planning division population figure and 
the public recreation land inventory in the Oakland Park Comprehensive Plan. 
(F) ?Determination of capacity availability . For purposes of these regulations, the capacity availability 
shall be determined by: 
(1) ?Adding together: 
(a) ?The total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
(b) ?The total design capacity of new facilities that will come available concurrent with the 
impact of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one (1) or 
more of the following is shown: 
1. ?The necessary facilities are in place at the time a plat approval is issued, or a plat 
approval is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place 
when the impacts of development occur. 
2. ?Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of application. 
3. ?The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of 
the facilities to be constructed within a period of time as stipulated in the contract or 
the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued. 
4. ?The new facilities have been included in a funded capital improvement program 
annual budget. 
5. ?The new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development 
agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, 
development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or 
development order pursuant to F.S. Ch. 380. Such facilities must be consistent with 
the Capital Improvements Element of the City of Oakland Park Comprehensive Plan 
and approved by the city/county engineer. 
6. ?The developer has contributed funds to the City of Oakland Park, Broward County or 
other governmental entity necessary to provide new facilities consistent with the 
Capital Improvements Element of the City of Oakland Park Comprehensive Plan. 
Commitment that the facilities will be built must be evidenced by an appropriate 
budget amendment and appropriation by the city, county or other governmental entity. 
(2) ?Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
(a) ?The design demand for the service created by existing development; and 
(b) ?The new design demand for the service (by phase or otherwise) that will be created 
concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development by the anticipated completion of 
other presently approved developments. 
(G) ?Park impact fee. 
(1) ?If required by the city, residential development shall be subject to payment of a park impact fee 
at the time of building permit issuance for any new residential dwelling unit. A park impact fee 
shall be paid in the amount of one thousand five hundred ($1,500.00) per new unit. 
(2) ?When requiring the park impact fee in lieu of land dedication, a payment of $1,500 shall be 
required prior to issuance of a permit for each new unit. 
(a) ?Example: 5 dwelling units × $1,500 = $7,500 fee in lieu of land dedication. 
(b) ?Fees collected shall be kept in an appropriate park impact fee account for the purpose of 
park land acquisition, development, enhancement or expansion of existing city owned 
parks or sites that the city maintains for recreational purposes. The expenditure of these 
funds shall accommodate increased utilization at the city owned or maintained parks or 
sites. 
(H) ?Fees collected for acquisition and/or development of park improvements for future park areas shall 
be utilized by the city within five (5) years of payment by the applicant. After five (5) years, the 
applicant that provided the original impact fees shall be reimbursed the original dollar amount paid. 
In the event that development of the property does not occur and vested rights lapse, the city shall 
return the original fee payment to the original payor. 
(I) ?Compliance with proportionate fair share requirements of F.S. Ch. 163.3180. In compliance with the 
transportation proportionate fair share requirements of F.S. Ch. 163.3180, determination of an 
applicant's fulfillment of transportation concurrency requirements under the city and county 
comprehensive plans shall be made, and transit concurrency assessments shall be imposed in 
accordance with the methodology provided for transit oriented concurrency districts in section 5-
182(a)(5)a. of the Broward County Code as amended from time to time.

before the beginning of the next school year. 
(e) ?Student generation rates 
1. ?The effective adopted student generation rate(s) contained within the Broward County 
Land Development Code as amended from time to time shall be utilized to determine 
the potential student impact anticipated from the residential development proposed in 
submitted applications. 
(f) ?Review procedure. 
1. ?Public school impact application (PSIA). 
a. ?Any applicant submitting an application with a residential component, that is not 
exempt or vested, is subject to public school concurrency and shall be required

district. Evidence of acceptance of the PSIA and payment of the applicable 
application fee to the school district shall be required prior to acceptance of the 
application by Broward County and Oakland Park. 
2. ?School capacity availability determination letter (SCAD). 
a. ?No residential application or amendments thereto, shall be approved by the 
county or Oakland Park, unless the residential development is exempt or vested 
from the requirements of public school concurrency, until a school capacity 
availability determination (SCAD) letter has been received from the school district 
confirming that capacity is available, or if capacity is not available, that 
proportionate share mitigation has been accepted by the school board. The 
SCAD letter shall be sent to the applicant, the Broward County Development 
Management Division and the local government with jurisdiction over the subject 
development, no later than forty-five (45) days after acceptance of the completed 
PSIA by the school district. 
b. ?The school district shall determine the potential student impact from proposed 
residential development on the applicable CSA by performing the review 
procedure specified in school board policy 1161, as amended. 
c. ?If the school district reviews an application and determines that sufficient 
permanent capacity is available at the adopted LOS to accommodate students 
anticipated from the development, the school district shall issue a SCAD letter 
indicating that adequate school facilities exist to accommodate the student 
impact and that the proposed development satisfies public school concurrency 
requirements. 
d. ?If the SCAD letter states that the development has not satisfied public school 
concurrency requirements, the SCAD letter shall state the basis for such 
determination, and the applicant shall have thirty (30) days to propose 
proportionate share mitigation to the school district. 
e. ?If the applicant proposes proportionate share mitigation within the thirty-day 
deadline, upon the subsequent acceptance of the proposed mitigation by the 
school board, and upon the execution of a legally binding document among the 
school board, the municipality, if applicable, and the applicant, an amended 
SCAD letter shall state that adequate capacity anticipated from the accepted 
proportionate share mitigation will be available to accommodate the student 
impact anticipated from the proposed development and that the proposed 
development satisfies public school concurrency requirements. The total amount 
committed for any mitigation option shall not be less than the school impact fees 
due for the proposed units as calculated based upon the adopted school impact 
fee schedule specified in subsection 24-176(E). The school impact fee due for 
the project shall be considered included in the total proportionate share mitigation 
amount due or paid. If the proportionate share mitigation is not accepted by the 
school board, the amended SCAD letter shall state the basis upon which the 
mitigation proposal(s) was rejected and why the development is not in 
compliance with public school concurrency requirements. 
f. ?An applicant adversely impacted by a SCAD determination may appeal such 
determination by written request to the school board within the designated thirty-
day time period. A timely request for an appeal shall stay the requirement for an 
applicant to propose proportionate share mitigation until the appeal has been 
resolved. 
g. ?If an application or approval expires, the SCAD Letter will no longer be valid. 
(g) ?Expiration of concurrency/vesting. 
1. ?The public school concurrency approval for a residential application shall expire if 
development does not commence, as outlined in 2. below, within five (5) years 
following the date of county commission approval. 
2. ?If a residential application received approval, the development and anticipated 
students shall be considered vested for up to five (5) years beginning from the date 
the developer received approval from the county. Vesting of a residential application 
beyond the five (5) years requires that one of the following conditions are met within 
the five-year period: 1) the issuance of a building permit for a principal building and 
first inspection approval or 2) substantial completion of project water lines, sewer lines 
and the rock base for internal roads. If the development was denied, the district shall 
deduct from its database, students associated with the development. 
(F) ?Development does not include a structure, or alteration thereof, that is subject to the notice 
requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Part 77, Subpart B, unless the Federal 
Aviation Administration issues, or has issued within the previous ninety (90) days, a written 
acknowledgement that said structure or alteration would not constitute a hazard to air navigation

Sec. 24-189. - General review procedures. 
    The following procedure shall apply to all plat applications for subdividing or resubdividing lands in 
the city: 
(A) ?Submission and processing of plats. 
(1) ?Copies of preliminary plat: A subdivider seeking approval of a subdivision shall submit the 
number of copies of the preliminary plat specified in the application to the community 
development department. A copy of this preliminary plat shall then be referred to 
appropriate staff members and other agencies for review and comments. 
(2) ?When considered by the planning and zoning board: The community development 
department shall report the recommendations of the development review committee to the 
planning and zoning board together with an analysis of the conformance and 
nonconformance of the preliminary plat to Chapter 24, Land Development Code and other 
applicable laws, regulations and standards. 
(3) ?Preliminary plat as final plat: If the preliminary plat and supporting data filed with the 
community development department comply in all respects with the requirements of 
Chapter 24, Land Development Code and other applicable laws, regulations and standards 
for a final plat, the planning and zoning board may, in the case of a subdivision involving no 
new streets, proceed to final action upon the first consideration of the plat. 
(4) ?Fees: Fees are established in the Land Development Fee Schedule. 
(B) ?Approval of preliminary plat. 
(1) ?Meetings, hearings: At a scheduled public meeting the planning and zoning board will 
receive reports on and review the preliminary plat to determine its conformance to these 
regulations. While no public hearing shall be required on the proposed plat unless a public 
right-of-way or easement is intended to be vacated, the subdivider and any other person 
interested in or affected by the proposed subdivision shall have a right to be heard by the 
planning and zoning board either in person or by letter, before the action of the planning 
and zoning board is taken. The planning and zoning board shall have the right to call for a 
public hearing if it deems the same advisable. 
(2) ?Action by planning and zoning board: The planning and zoning board may approve the 
preliminary plat as presented if found to be in conformance with these regulations. The 
planning and zoning board may approve the preliminary plat with conditions if found to be 
in substantial conformance. The planning and zoning board may disapprove the plat when 
not found to be in conformance. Approval of the preliminary plat subject to conditions, 
revisions and modifications as stipulated by the planning and zoning board shall constitute 
conditional approval of the subdivision and the applicant may proceed to the final plat 
process. 
(3) ?Optional city commission review: Prior to incurring the costs of preparing a final plat, an 
applicant may request to have the city commission review and take action on the 
preliminary plat by submitting a letter to the community development department and 
submitting the fee as specified in the land development fee schedule. 
[(C) ?Reserved.] 
(D) ?Approval of final plat. 
(1) ?Submission to planning and zoning board: Within six (6) months after planning and zoning 
board approval on a preliminary plat, a final plat and necessary supporting data shall be 
submitted to the community development department for final approval; provided, however, 
that an extension of time may be granted by the community development department upon 
written request. 
(2) ?Conformity to preliminary plat: The final plat shall conform in all important respects with 
the preliminary plat as previously reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning board 
and shall incorporate any modifications and revisions specified by the planning and zoning 
board in a conditional approval of the preliminary plat. 
(3) ?When reviewed by the planning and zoning board: The board shall review the final plat at 
a scheduled public meeting. 
(4) ?Presentation to the city commission: Within sixty (60) days after approval of a final plat by 
the planning and zoning board, the final plat or section thereof shall be presented for 
approval by the city commission. Should the plat not be presented to the city commission 
within sixty (60) days, the approval of the planning and zoning board shall expire unless a 
written request for an extension is submitted to the community development department 
and granted. 
(5) ?Copies required: Two (2) prints and one (1) reduced eight and one-half (8½) inch by 
fourteen (14) inch copy shall be provided to the community development department upon 
approval of the final plat. 
(6) ?Submission in sections: The community development department may permit the 
submission and approval of the final plat in phases, each covering a portion of the entire 
proposed subdivision as shown on the preliminary plat provided the infrastructure 
improvements are installed in an appropriate sequence as determined by the city engineer.

    Final plats shall include all information required by Broward County for such plats. 
(Ord. No. O-93-17, § 6, 10-20-93) 


Sec. 24-192. - Procedures for the improvement of public facilities. 
(A) ?Infrastructure improvement plans. Prior to the construction of any infrastructure improvements 
required or to the submission of a bond, letter of credit or cash deposit in lieu thereof, the subdivider 
shall furnish the public works department with all plans, information and data necessary to determine 
the character of said improvements and compliance with city standards and specifications. Plans 
shall be reviewed by the city engineer for conformance with city standards and specifications. 
Following the review, the city engineer shall determine the amount of any bond required. 
(B) ?Bond, letter of credit or cash deposit. 
(1) ?No final plat of any subdivision shall be approved unless the subdivider shall file with the city a 
surety bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Florida and 
having a resident agent in Broward County, a letter of credit drawn upon a federal or state 
chartered lending institution identifying the City of Oakland Park, Florida, as beneficiary and 
callable at a Broward County branch of such institution or a cash deposit. The bond, letter of 
credit or cash deposit shall be conditioned to secure construction of the infrastructure 
improvements required under section 24-96 in a satisfactory manner and shall remain in effect 
until completion of the improvements and acceptance by the city, but in no event less than two 
(2) years. 
(2) ?All bonding of construction of infrastructure improvements, regardless of form, must receive the 
city engineer's review and approval for any extension beyond the initial two-year period. The 
bond amount must be subject to adjustment if the period is extended. Thereafter, such 
extended bonds will be subject to an annual review. If an additional extension is requested, the 
city shall make a determination on whether the bonds may be extended for another year and in 
what amount, or if the bonds shall be called for completion of construction. 
(3) ?No such bond, letter of credit or cash deposit shall be accepted unless it is enforceable by or 
payable to the city in a sum equal to one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the cost of 
constructing the infrastructure improvements, as estimated by the engineer of record, and 
approved by the city engineer, and in form with surety and conditions approved by the city 
attorney. No assignment of any bond will be made without the written consent of the city. 
(4) ?In case of forfeiture, the city shall proceed to call in such bond or letter of credit, and, at its 
option, shall either: 
(a) ?Proceed with the infrastructure improvements to the extent of the available money realized 
from such forfeiture; or 
(b) ?Deposit the available money in the appropriate fund for future use in the construction of 
such infrastructure improvements. 
(5) ?A one-year warranty bond, letter of credit, or cash deposit shall be required on any constructed 
improvement on which the city has accepted a bill of sale. The amount of such bond will be at 
twenty-five (25) percent of actual cost of construction as certified by the engineer or record.

ARTICLE XV. - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 


Sec. 24-205. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to provide for the regulations of nonconforming uses and structures 
which existed lawfully (whether by special exception, variance, or otherwise) on the effective date of 
passage or amendment of this chapter and which fail to conform to any of the applicable regulations 
contained herein. Nonconforming uses are deemed to be: incompatible with and detrimental to permitted 
uses and structures in the zones in which they are located; the cause of disruption of the comprehensive 
land use patterns of the city; an inhibition of present and future development of nearby properties; 
conferring upon their owners and users an absolute franchise and hence a position of unfair advantage. A 
rigid control on expansion and the eventual elimination or reduction to conformity, as expeditiously as is 
reasonable, of nonconforming uses or structures is declared to be as much a subject of health, safety and 
welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this 
chapter. 
(Ord. No. O-90-21, § 10, 10-17-90) 


Sec. 24-206. - Nonconforming buildings or structures. 
    Any nonconforming building or structure may be continued subject to the following conditions and 
requirements: 
(A) ?Repairs, Alterations and Enlargements . Any nonconforming structure may be repaired or 
altered subject to the provisions of this article, provided there is no increase in nonconformity. 
(B) ?Restoration. 
(1) ?Damage less than fifty (50) percent of restoration cost: If a nonconforming structure is 
damaged by any means to the extent that the cost of restoration would be less than fifty 
(50) percent of the replacement cost of the entire building or structure at the time of the 
damage, such structure may be restored subject to the following provisions: 
(a) ?No nonconformity shall be increased beyond its extent prior to the damage. 
(b) ?Restoration shall be completed within twelve (12) months after the infliction of the 
damage. 
(2) ?Damage or deterioration more than fifty (50) percent of restoration cost: If a 
nonconforming building or structure is damaged or deteriorated by any means to the extent 
that the cost of restoration would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost 
of the entire building or structure, it shall not be restored and may be replaced only by a 
conforming building or structure. 
(Ord. No. O-90-21, § 10, 10-17-90) 


Sec. 24-207. - Nonconforming uses. 
    Any nonconforming use of a building or land may be continued subject to the following conditions 
and requirements: 
(A) ?Expansion . A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land shall not be expanded into 
any other portion of such building, structure or lot occupied by such use. 
(B) ?Change . The nonconforming use of a building, structure or land may be changed only to a 
conforming use except as provided. If a nonconforming use of a building, structure or land has 
been changed to a conforming use, it may thereafter be changed only to another conforming 
use. 
(C) ?Existing use . Any existing use which is classified as a conditional use in the zone in which it is 
located shall be deemed to have been authorized subject to maintaining the existing character 
and extent of operations and structures. 
(D) ?Discontinuance . A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land which has been 
discontinued shall not be returned to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be 
considered to be discontinued when the premises have been devoted to another use or the 
premises have been vacant for a period of two (2) months. 
(E) ?Elimination. Any use existing on the effective date of this chapter or any amendment to it which 
is classified as a nonconforming use in the zoning classification in which it is located shall be 
terminated by the year 2010. By July 1, 2001, the code enforcement officer shall issue a special 
certificate of occupancy to the owner of all nonconforming uses, which shall state the future 
date of termination of the nonconforming use, and said special certificate of occupancy shall be 
prominently displayed on said property. 
    Any owner that perceives the year 2010 date to constitute a unique hardship may apply to a 
nonconforming use amortization board which is hereby created. The five-person board shall be appointed 
by the city commission and shall include at least one (1) accountant familiar with tax and business law, 
and one (1) architect or builder. All applications for extensions must be submitted to the code 
enforcement officer by January 1, 2002; said applications must be accompanied by an appraisal, and a 
statement of what is unique to this use and structure. No extension shall be granted beyond the year 
2020.

Sec. 24-208. - Nonconforming lots in R-1 and R-2. 
    If two (2) or more lots with continuous frontage and in common ownership were of record on August 
6th, 1958, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for building site area or width, the land 
shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this code and no division of the parcel 
which does not comply with the building site area and width requirements of this code shall be made. This 
requirement shall not apply to lots or parcels located within the community redevelopment area.

of this Code except where otherwise specified herein. In addition, he may request the assistance of 
other appropriate officers or agencies of the City of Oakland Park when appropriate. 
(B) ?City manager's role . In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, 
altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of 
any ordinance or other regulation of the City of Oakland Park, the city manager, in addition to other 
remedies provided by ordinance, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such 
unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or use, to 
restrain, correct or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure or land, 
or to prevent any illegal act, conduct of business or use in or about such premises, regardless of 
whether a permit for such construction or use has been issued or not, and in case of failure of the 
City of Oakland Park to take proper action within a reasonable time, any taxpayer may do so. 
(C) ?Violations . The director of code enforcement and his staff shall investigate promptly all complaints 
of violations and report his findings and actions to complaints, and he shall use his best endeavors to 
prevent violations and to detect and cause violations to be corrected. If he finds that any of the 
provisions of this chapter are being violated, he shall notify in writing the person responsible for the 
violation, indicating the nature of the violation, and order the action necessary to correct it. He shall 
order the discontinuance of the illegal use of land, buildings, or structures; removal of illegal buildings 
or structures or of illegal additions, alterations, or structural changes; discontinuance of any illegal 
work being done; or shall take any other lawful action authorized by this chapter to insure 
compliance with or to prevent violation of these regulations. 
(D) ?Complaints . Whenever a violation of this chapter is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a 
complaint in writing and signed by the person complaining. Such complaints stating fully the cause 
and basis shall be filed with the zoning inspector. He shall properly record the complaint, 
immediately investigate, and take action as provided by this chapter. He shall maintain as a public 
record in his office the disposition made of all complaints. 
(E) ?Written records . The director of code enforcement shall maintain written records of all official 
actions of his office, of all complaints and actions taken, and of all violations discovered by whatever

(Ord. No. O-90-21, § 10, 10-17-90) 


Sec. 24-218. - Action on permits. 
(A) ?Building permit . The director of code enforcement shall be responsible for determining whether 
applications for building permits are in accord with the requirements of this chapter. No building 
permit shall be issued without written certification from the director of code enforcement or his 
designee that the plans conform to applicable zoning regulations. No building permit shall be issued 
for the erection, moving, addition to, or alteration of any building or structure except in conformity 
with the provisions of this chapter unless a written order is received as a result of an administrative 
review from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(B) ?Required information . All applications for building permits shall, in addition to containing the 
information required by the building department and a site plan if required by article XII, shall meet 
the application form instructions of the director of code enforcement in order to determine 
compliance with and provide for the enforcement of the regulations in this chapter. The application 
shall be accompanied by a survey of the lot, made by a land surveyor or engineer licensed in Florida. 
If the application is for construction of a principal building, the survey shall have been prepared within 
the last six (6) months, and be deed abstracted for easements. Otherwise, the survey shall be 
accompanied by an agreement holding the city harmless for any fences or accessory buildings 
placed in easements. All property stakes shall be in place at the time of application. 
(C) ?Survey of replat . All permit applications for a building site obtained by redividing a portion of a 
recorded plat, specifically by crossing platted lot lines, shall be accompanied by a survey showing all 
existing structures, including abutting and adjoining lots. 
(D) ?Public improvement created nonconformity . Where an existing lot previously complied with the 
minimum area requirements of the zoning regulations, but because of public improvements through 
condemnation or such other legal proceedings, such lot is thereby placed in literal violation of the 
minimum width and area requirements of this chapter, the city manager shall have the discretion to 
waive the literal enforcement thereof, based upon hardship or good cause otherwise shown; 
provided, that no serious threat to the health, welfare or general appearance of the area is created. 
Such parcel may be occupied by a single-family residence or duplex and observe a minimum of five-
foot side yard. 
(E) ?Certificate of zoning compliance . It shall be unlawful to use or occupy, or permit the use or 
occupancy of any building or premises, or any part changed, wholly or partly in its use or structure 
until a certificate of zoning compliance is issued by the zoning inspector stating that the proposed 
use of the structure or land conforms to the requirements of these zoning regulations. No permit for 
erection, alteration, moving, or repair of any building shall be issued until an application has been 
made for a certificate of zoning compliance and the certificate shall be issued in conformity with the 
provisions of these zoning regulations upon completion of the work. The zoning inspector shall 
maintain a record of all certificates of zoning compliance. The file shall be maintained as a public 
record. Failure to obtain a certificate of zoning compliance shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
(F) ?Temporary certificate of zoning compliance . This certificate may be issued by the zoning inspector 
for a period not exceeding six (6) months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building 
pending its completion, provided that the temporary certificate may include conditions and 
safeguards necessary under the circumstances to protect the safety of occupants and the general 
public. 
(G) ?Deviations from certified use . Building permits or certificates of zoning compliance issued on the 
basis of plans and specifications approved by the zoning inspector authorize only the use, 
arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other. Use, 
arrangement, or construction different from that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this 
chapter. Statements made by the applicant on the building permit application shall be deemed 
official. Approval of the application by the zoning inspector shall in no way exempt the applicant from 
strict observance of applicable provisions of this chapter and all other applicable regulations, 
ordinances, codes and laws. 
(H) ?Excessive plumbing and wiring . When plans and specifications are submitted to the building and 
code enforcement departments of the city for a permit to erect a residential use in any zoning district, 
and should such plans and specifications, in the opinion of the building official or code enforcement 
officer, be of a structure which might be used contrary to the issued permit, or could easily be 
modified to serve such purpose, or that the plumbing, gas lines or electric wiring, other than that 
installed in the kitchen, may be used for purposes other than for the use as issued, then the building 
official or his designee shall have the right to refuse to issue a building permit thereof; provided, 
further, that all appeals from the decision of the building official shall be made to the board of 
adjustment of the City of Oakland Park for final disposition. 
(I) ?Permit issued in error . A building permit issued in error shall not confer any rights or privileges to the 
applicant to proceed in construction, and the City of Oakland Park shall have the power to revoke 
such a permit whether or not actual construction has commenced. 
(J) ?Properties in violation. When a property has been found to be in violation of this chapter and the 
violation has not been corrected, no permit(s) shall be issued unless the permit(s) is to correct the 
violation(s) or is required to use the property in compliance with this chapter. It is the express intent 
of this subsection not to prohibit any repair necessary to comply with Chapter 5, Building, 
Construction and Minimum Housing, Article IV, Minimum Housing Code; or any permit necessary to 
comply with this chapter whether or not a violation has been found.

Sec. 24-219. - Authority to withhold permits and licenses; zoning in progress. 
    When a change of text of regulating residential densities, permitted land uses, dimensional and other 
regulations contained in this chapter is being considered by the city, for a period of time not to exceed six 
(6) months after first advertised notice of public hearing before the city commission has been published 
by the city, no permit or license shall be issued by the city where the issuance of such permit or license 
would result in the nonconforming or unlawful use of the property should such proposed change be 
adopted; provided that, if final action by the city commission is not taken on the proposed change within 
six (6) months from the date of such publication, the permit or license shall be issued.

or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties 
provided.

ARTICLE XVII. - REVIEW BOARDS 


Sec. 24-232. - Board of adjustment. 
(A) ?Establishment and membership. Each member of the city commission shall nominate one (1) 
member of the board of adjustment. An alternate member shall be appointed by majority vote of the 
city commission. All appointments shall be subject to approval of the city commission by resolution. 
Vacancies in the board of adjustment shall be filled in the same manner. New appointees shall serve 
for a period of two (2) years from the date of appointment; an appointee to fill a vacancy arising 
during the term of a member shall serve for the duration of said term and until a successor is 
appointed. Each member of the board of adjustment shall be a resident and qualified elector of the 
City of Oakland Park. Any member of said board may be removed for cause by the affirmative vote 
of the city commission. Said board, from its membership, shall elect a chairman, vice-chairman and 
secretary. The alternate member is to be paid at the same rate as regular members for all meetings 
attended as an official delegate. Attendance policy for members of this board is governed by section 
2-72 of this Code of Ordinances. 
(B) ?Duties of the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall have the following duties: 
(1) ?To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, 
decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of zoning 
regulations, and to act upon such ruling upon misinterpretation of facts or misinterpretation of 
law. 
(2) ?Accept applications, hear and determine appeals requesting variances from the terms of this 
chapter and, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards where such variance will not be 
contrary to the public interest or the general purposes sought to be accomplished by the 
regulations, and where, owing to special conditions, a literal and exact enforcement of the 
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship in the use of the property involved. 
(C) ?Basis for a variance. The board of adjustment shall approve a variance only after the applicant has 
demonstrated justification for the granting of a variance in conformance with the following criteria: 
(1) ?That special conditions and circumstances exist affecting the land, structure or building 
involved preventing the reasonable use of said land, structure or building. 
(2) ?That the circumstances which cause the hardship are peculiar to the property, or to such a 
small number of properties that they clearly constitute marked exceptions to other properties in 
the district. 
(3) ?That the literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of a 
substantial property right that is enjoyed by other property owners in the district. (It is of no 
importance whatever that the denial of the variance might deny to the property owner some 
opportunity to use the property in a more profitable way, or to sell it at a greater profit than is 
possible under the terms of this chapter). 
(4) ?That the hardship is not self-created or the result of mere disregard for, or ignorance of, the 
provisions of this chapter. 
(5) ?That the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the 
property, and that the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this 
chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public 
welfare. 
(6) ?That granting the variance requested will not be detrimental to adjacent property or adversely 
affect the public welfare. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in 
the same district, and no permitted use of land, structures or buildings in other districts shall be 
grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
(7) ?Under no circumstances shall the board of adjustment recommend a variance to permit use not 
generally permitted in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by 
the terms of this chapter in said district. 
(D) ?Meetings of the board of adjustment. The board shall meet at such times as may be provided by 
ordinance, rules of the city commission or at the call of the chairman. Such chairman, or in his 
absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All 
meetings of the board shall be open to the public. 
(E) ?Records. 
(1) ?The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each 
question submitted to it, or, if a member is absent or fails to vote, such fact shall appear upon its 
minutes. 
(2) ?Records shall be kept of its examinations and other official actions and shall become a public 
record. 
(3) ?In recommending any variance, the board shall record in its minutes the circumstances and 
conditions constituting the hardship or practical difficulty upon which the variance is based. 
(4) ?Copies of its minutes shall be immediately filed with the city clerk and shall become a public 
record.

adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed that, by reason of facts stated in the 
certificate, a stay would, in the opinion of the official, cause imminent peril to life and property. In 
such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order by a court of 
record on application or notice to the official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause 
shown.

as amended from time to time, or payment thereof enforced as otherwise authorized by

(G) ?Enforcement procedures. 
(1) ?Except as provided herein, if a violation of the Code of Ordinances is found, the code inspector 
shall notify the violator and give him a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the 
violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall notify the 
code enforcement board through the community development department, and request a 
hearing. 
    The community development department shall schedule a hearing and written notice of such hearing 
shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided by F.S. Ch. 162, to said violator. At the option of the code 
enforcement board, notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in F.S. § 
162.12, as amended. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the 
time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the code enforcement 
board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(2) ?If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to 
give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying 
the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the code enforcement board and request a hearing. 
The community development department shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice 
pursuant to F.S. § 162.12, as amended. The case may be presented to the code enforcement 
board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice 
shall so state. 
(3) ?If the code inspector has reason to believe that a violation presents a serious threat to the 
public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the 
code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify 
the code enforcement board and request a hearing. 
(H) ?Conduct of hearing. 
(1) ?The chairman of the code enforcement board or the community development department may 
call hearings of the code enforcement board; hearings may also be called by written notice 
signed by at least three (3) members of the code enforcement board. At any hearing the code 
enforcement board may set a future hearing date. The code enforcement board shall attempt to 
convene no less frequently than once every two (2) months, but may meet more or less often as 
the demand necessitates. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings by the code enforcement board, 
and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The community development 
department shall provide both clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably 
required by the code enforcement board for the proper performance of its duties. 
(2) ?Each case before the code enforcement board shall be presented by the local governing body 
attorney or by a member of the administrative staff of the City of Oakland Park. 
(3) ?The code enforcement board shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All 
testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The code enforcement board shall take 
testimony from the code inspector and alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, 
but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern said proceedings. 
(4) ?At the conclusion of the hearing, the code enforcement board shall issue findings of fact, based 
on evidence of record, and conclusions of law and shall issue an order affording the proper 
relief consistent with powers granted herein. The findings shall be by motion approved by a 
majority of those present and voting, except that at least four (4) members of the code 
enforcement board must vote in order for the action to be official. The order may include a 
notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine be imposed if the order is 
not complied with by said date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public 
records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in 
interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be 
binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent 
purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records 
pursuant to this sub-section and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, 
the code enforcement board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be 
recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging 
compliance. 
(I) ?Powers of the code enforcement board . The code enforcement board shall have the power to: 
(1) ?Adopt rules for the conduct of its hearings. 
(2) ?Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the 
sheriff of the county or police department of the City of Oakland Park. 
(3) ?Subpoena evidence. 
(4) ?Take testimony under oath. 
(5) ?Issue orders having the force of law commanding whatever steps are necessary to bring a 
violation into compliance. 
(J) ?Administrative fines; liens. 
(1) ?The code enforcement board, upon notification by a code inspector that an order of the code 
enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time, or, upon finding that a repeat 
violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this 
section for each day the violation continues past the day set by the code enforcement board for 
compliance, or in the case of a repeat violation for each day the repeat violation continues past 
the date of notice to the violator of the repeat violation. If a finding of a violation or a repeat 
violation has been made as provided herein, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of 
the order imposing a fine. Fines imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred 
fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars 
($500.00) per day for a repeat violation. 
(2) ?In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the code enforcement board shall consider the 
following factors: 
(a) ?The gravity of the violation; 
(b) ?Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violations; and 
(c) ?Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(3) ?The code enforcement board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(4) ?A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and 
thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any 
other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the Circuit Court, such 
order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, 
including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed a court 
judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall 
continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a 
suit to foreclose on the lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. After three (3) 
months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the code enforcement board may 
authorize through the city commission, the city attorney to foreclose on a lien. No lien created 
pursuant to the provisions of the section may be foreclosed on real property which is a 
homestead under section 4, article 10 of the State of Florida Constitution. 
(K) ?Duration of lien . No lien provided under the local government code enforcement board's act shall 
continue for a period longer than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine 
has been recorded unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court 
of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover 
all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The continuation of 
the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or 
subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is 
recorded. 
(L) ?Appeals . An aggrieved party including the city commission may appeal a final administrative order 
of the [Code] enforcement board to the Circuit Court. An appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days 
of the execution of the order to be appealed. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but 
shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the code enforcement board. 
(M) ?Notices. 
(1) ?All notices required by this chapter shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, 
return receipt requested; by hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code 
inspector, or other person designated by the city commission; or by leaving the notice at the 
violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above fifteen (15) 
years of age and informing such persons of the contents of the notice. 
(2) ?In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (1), at the option of the code 
enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(a) ?Such notice shall be published once during each week for four (4) consecutive weeks 
(four (4) publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in Broward 
County. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. Ch. 
50, for legal and official advertisements. 
Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041, and 50.051. 
(b) ?Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or 
attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (1). 
Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in 
subsection (1), together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (2), 
shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this part have been met, without 
regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
(N) ?Enforcement of the codes or ordinances; penalties 
(1) ?As used in this section, code enforcement officer means any designated employee or agent of 
the City of Oakland Park whose duty it is to enforce codes and ordinances enacted by the City 
of Oakland Park, Florida. 
(2) ?The city may designate certain of its employees or agents as code enforcement officers. The 
training and qualifications of the employees or agents for such designation shall be determined 
by the city. Employees or agents who may be designated as code enforcement officers may 
include, but are not limited to code inspectors, law enforcement officers, animal control officers, 
or fire safety inspectors. Designation as a code enforcement officer with the power of arrest or 
subject to the code enforcement officer to the provisions of F.S. §§ 943.085 through 943.255, as 
amended. Nothing in this section amends, alters or contravenes the provisions of any state-
administered retirement system or any state-supported retirement system established by 
general law. 
(3) ?(a)  
A code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a citation to a person when based upon 
personal investigation, the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has 
committed a civil infraction in violation of a duly enacted code or ordinance and the special 
master will hear the charge. 
(b) ?Prior to issuing a citation, a code enforcement officer shall provide notice to the person 
that the person has committed a violation of the code or ordinance and shall establish a 
reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time period 
shall be no more than thirty (30) days. If, upon personal investigation, a code enforcement 
officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the time period, a code 
enforcement officer may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation. A 
code enforcement officer does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time 
period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a 
citation if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a 
serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or 
irreversible. 
(c) ?A citation issue by a code enforcement officer shall be in a form prescribed by the City of 
Oakland Park and shall contain: 
1. ?The date and time of issuance. 
2. ?The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued.

citation.

9. ?The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
10. ?A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the 
time allowed, or fails to request an administrative hearing before the special master to 
contest the citation, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the citation 
and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up 
to the maximum civil penalty. 
11. ?A notice that additional citations may be issued for each day that the applicable 
violation is found to exist. 
12. ?A notice that the person may be liable for the reasonable costs of the administrative 
hearing should the person be found guilty of the violation. 
(4) ?After issuing a citation to an alleged violator, a code enforcement officer shall deposit the 
original citation and one (1) copy of the citation with the community development department. 
(5) ?Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code enforcement 
officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. § 
775.082 or § 775.083. 
(6) ?The provisions of this section shall not apply to the enforcement pursuant to section 553.79 
and 553.80 of building codes adopted pursuant to section 553.73, Florida Statutes as they apply 
to construction provided that a building permit is either not required or has been issued by the 
city. For the purposes of this subsection, "building codes" means only those codes adopted 
pursuant to said section 553.73. 
(7) ?The provisions of this section are additional and supplemental means of enforcing the city's 
codes and ordinances and may be used for the enforcement of any codes or ordinance, or for 
the enforcement of all codes and ordinances. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the 
city from enforcing its codes or ordinances by any other means. 
(O) ?Options of persons cited. 
(1) ?A person who has been served with a citation shall expect either to: 
(a) ?Correct the violation, and pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the notice; or 
(b) ?Request an administrative hearing before a special master to appeal the decision of the 
code inspector to issue the citation. 
(2) ?Appeal by administrative hearing of the citation shall be accomplished by filing a request in 
writing to the address indicated on the notice, not later than ten (10) days after the service of the 
notice. 
(3) ?Failure of a person to appeal the decision of the code inspector within this time period shall 
constitute a waiver of the person's right to an administrative hearing. A waiver of the right to 
administrative hearing shall be deemed an admission of the violation and penalties may be 
imposed accordingly. 
(P) ?Schedule of civil penalties. 
(1) ?The following table sets forth code violations for which citations may be served and civil 
penalties may be cited under this article. The descriptions of violations are provided for

serve and better the public welfare and benefit the citizens and residents of the city providing for a 
orderly and structured development process for the area of the city designated as the Oakland Park 
Downtown Mixed Use District. In setting about to create the Downtown Mixed Use District, the city 
commission takes into account the findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions 
incorporated in numerous cases including but not limited to Louis vs. City of Atlantic Beach 467 So.

Enforcement Code 587 So. 2d 640 (Fla 2nd DCA 1997); and Hobbes vs. Department of 
Transportation 831 So. 2d 745 (Fla 5th DCA 2002) and finds that: 
(1) ?The enactment of this ordinance creating the Downtown Mixed Use District will serve to 
promote and benefit the welfare and safety of the city. 
(2) ?The redevelopment of the area adjacent to the Dixie Highway corridor which makes up the 
Downtown Mixed Use District will serve the public welfare by creating and providing financial 
viability for the City of Oakland Park. 
(3) ?The creation of the Downtown Mixed Use District will serve to protect and enhance the 
residential character of the city and promote the sense of community. 
(4) ?Creation of the Downtown Mixed Use District will serve to conserve and protect property and 
property values and will secure an appropriate use of the land within the district to insure that 
the long standing sense of community, an intregal component of the City of Oakland Park, is

(Ord. No. O-2004-030, § 2, 12-1-04; Ord. No. O-2010-002, § 2, 2-3-10; Ord. No. 2010-027, §§ 
2, 3, 9-15-10; Ord. No. 2011-023, §§ 2, 3, 10-19-11; Ord. No. O-2017-015 , § 4, 10-18-17; Ord, No. 
O-2018-019 , § 9-12-18) 


Sec. 24-266. - Accessory structures. 
    See Chapter 24, sections 24-68, 24-69, and 24-70 for reference to accessory structures. 
(Ord. No. O-2004-030, § 2, 12-1-04) 


Sec. 24-267. - Non-conforming uses and structures. 
(A) ?It is the general policy of the city to allow uses, structures and lots that came into existence legally 
and in conformance with the zoning regulations applicable at the time the structure or use was 
established and for which all required permits were issued, but do not conform to all the applicable 
requirements of this code, specifically those sections applying to the Downtown Mixed Use District, 
to continue to exist and to be put to productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such situations 
into conformance with the current code as is reasonably practical, all subject to limitations of this 
section. The limitations of this section are intended to recognize the interest of the property owner in 
continuing to use the property but to preclude the expansion of the non-conforming situation and to 
preclude the reestablishment of an abandoned use or lot of a building or structure that has been 
substantially destroyed. It is not the intent of this section to limit the right of a property owner to 
continue the uses of land and structures as were in existence at the time of the adoption of this 
section, since it would be an injustice and unreasonable hardship to compel immediate removal or 
suppression of an otherwise lawful business or use already established within the district. 
(B) ?This section shall apply to circumstances, uses and buildings that become non-conforming by the 
enactment of this section to the code or an amendment to this section. It shall also apply to non-
conforming situations that were legal non-conforming uses or other situations, use and buildings 
under similar provision of a previously applicable section of the code and that remain non-conforming 
with one or more provisions of this section even if the type or extent of non-conformity is different. 
(C) ?Any non-conforming use, building, structure, or other non-conforming situations which exists 
lawfully on the date of the adoption of the ordinance enacting this section of the code or which 
becomes non-conforming upon the adoption of any amendment to this section of the code may be 
continued in accordance with provisions of this article. Where two or more provisions of this article 
apply, the more restrictive requirements applies. 
(D) ?The burden of establishing that any non-conforming situation is a legal non-conforming situation as 
defined by this section of the code, shall in all cases, be upon the property owner of such non-
conformity and not upon the City of Oakland Park or any other person or entity. 
(E) ?Definitions: 
(1) ?Legal non-conforming situations. A legal non-conforming situation is any land use, structure, lot 
of record, or other situation, related to the use or development of land that was legally 
established prior to the effective date of the ordinance adopting this section of the Code of 
Ordinances of the City of Oakland Park, or any subsequent amendment thereto and that it does 
not now fully conform to the requirements of this section, as amended to the applicable date. 
(2) ?Non-conforming use. A non-conforming use is a use of land, building(s) or other structure(s), or 
any combination thereof, which lawfully existed prior to the effective date of this article, or any 
subsequent amendment thereto, and which is maintained after the effective date of this article, 
or amendment thereto, although it does not comply with the permitted uses of the district in 
which it is located. 
(3) ?Non-conforming structure. A non-conforming structure is any building or structure which is in 
compliance with the zoning regulations applicable at the time the structure was established, and 
for which all required permits were issued. For purposes of this section, non-conforming 
structure shall be considered major or minor as defined herein: 
(a) ?A major non-conforming structure is any nonresidential building or structure located on a 
lot, parcel, or track which at any point borders a residential use in which exceeds the 
minimum density or intensity standards for the Downtown Mixed-Use District. 
(b) ?A minor non-conforming structure is any non-conforming building or structure which is not 
a major non-conforming building or structure. 
Other non-conforming situations include other aspects of an established land use or 
development that does not fully conform with the requirements of this section or any 
amendment thereto but which is legally non-conforming under subsection "A" above. Such other 
non-conforming situations include, but are not limited to, requirements for off street parking, 
landscaping requirements, and buffering requirements. 
(F) ?Non-conforming uses and structures. 
(1) ?Continuance permitted. A non-conforming use may continue, subject to requirements to this 
section. 
(2) ?Expansion prohibited. A non-conforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded. 
(3) ?Change of use. A non-conforming use may be changed only to a use conforming to the 
requirements of the Downtown Mixed Use District. 
(4) ?Non-Conforming structures. A non-conforming structure may be used for any permitted use in 
the Downtown Mix Used District or for any applicable legally non-conforming use. 
(5) ?Expansion prohibited. Any expansion of a non-conforming structure, which serves to expand 
the extent of the non-conformity use, is prohibited. 
(6) ?Moving prohibited. A non-conforming structure or use shall not be moved, in whole or in part, 
for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other parcel within the 
Oakland Park Downtown Mixed Used District unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform 
to the regulations of the Downtown Mixed Use District. 
(7) ?Maintenance, repairs, and remodeling. Maintenance and repairs of a non-conforming structure 
are permitted. Remodeling of the structure within the existing building footprint is permitted 
without a variance, provided that the remodeling does not increase the degree of non-
conformity and that applicable building and life safety codes are complied with the fullest extent. 
(8) ?Termination of non-conforming situations. 
(a) ?Termination by abandonment. Discontinuance of a non-conforming use or structure for a 
period more than six (6) months shall be determined to be an abandonment, and such use 
or structure shall not then be reestablished except in conformance with the requirements of 
the Downtown Mixed Use District, or, in the case of a structure, according to subsection 
(G) below. For purposes of this section, abandonment shall be defined and determined to 
occur when the property owner intentionally and voluntarily forgoes further non-conforming 
use of the property. Hobes vs. The Department of Transportation 831 So. 2d 745 (Fla. 5th 
DCA 2002) and Louis vs. City of Atlantic Beach 467 So. 2d 751 (Fla. 1st DCA 1985). 
(b) ?Termination by damage or destruction. 
(i) ?In the event that any minor non-conforming structure or use is destroyed by any 
means to the extent of fifty (50) percent or any major non-conforming structure or use 
is destroyed by, by any means, to the extent of more than twenty-five (25) percent of 
the cost of replacement of such structure or use, said structure or use shall not be 
rebuilt, restored, re-established or reoccupied, except in conformance with the 
applicable regulations of this section pertaining to the Downtown Mixed Use District. 
(ii) ?When a non-conforming structure or use is damaged or destroyed to a lesser percentage 
of the replacement costs as specified in subsection (a) above, no repairs or rebuilding shall 
be permitted except in conformity with the sections of this code and the applicable 
requirements of this section pertaining to the Downtown Mixed Use District. 
(iii) ?It is the expressed intention of the city commission that the legal requirements set forth in 
the Code of Ordinances that all non-conforming uses must be brought into conformity by 
the year 2010 shall not apply to non-conforming situations located within the Downtown 
Mixed Use District. 
(9) ?Violations, penalties, and enforcement. It is the intent of the city commission that the code 
enforcement division and the building department shall share responsibilities for enforcing this 
section of the code to the extent that such enforcement falls within the scope of each of the 
department's administrative responsibilities under this section. Responsibility for brining 
enforcement actions shall lie with the building officials for violations involving buildings, with the 
code enforcement officers for all other violations, and both of them for violations involving both 
buildings and other matters under this Code. 
(10) ?Compliance required . Any individual or legal entity utilizing land or building or other structure, 
or any other individual or legal entity subdividing land, or any individual legal entity using or 
developing land or engaged in any other action subject to the scope of this section of the code 
within municipal boundaries of the City of Oakland Park shall comply with all requirements of 
this Code. 
(11) ?Violations. It shall be a violation of this section to do any of the following:

this section; 
(b) ?To erect or attempt to erect a building or any structure in any way not consistent with

this section without first obtaining all such required permits or approvals. 
(f) ?To engage in the use or a building or land, the use or installation of a sign, subdivision or 
development of land or any other activity requiring one or more permits under this section

as to ensure that the integrity of this section of the code is maintained.

States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, 36 CFR 67: 
(1) ?A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal 
change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2) ?The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic 
materials or alteration of exterior features that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3) ?Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that 
create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or 
architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4) ?Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in 
their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5) ?Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that 
characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
(6) ?Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of 
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in 
design, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of 
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence. 
(7) ?Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials 
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using 
the gentlest means possible. 
(8) ?Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If 
such resources must be disturbed, work shall be monitored by an archaeologist, as appropriate, 
and mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9) ?New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall not destroy historic 
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and 
shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the 
historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10) ?New additions or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if 
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its 
environment would be unimpaired.

Sec. 25-109. - Review criteria for proposed new construction and additions. 
    New construction and additions associated with an individually designated historic resource shall be 
compatible with the buildings, site, or environment with which the new construction is visually related. 
Criteria to be considered by the historic preservation board shall include the following: 
(1) ?The height, volume, mass, scale, proportions and relationship between doors and windows, 
rhythm of solids and voids created by openings in the facade, materials used in the facade, the 
texture inherent in the facade, the pattern and trim used in the facade, and the design of the 
roof shall be compatible with any existing historic buildings within view of the property. 
(2) ?Rhythm created by existing building masses and spaces between them shall be preserved. 
(3) ?Landscape plans shall be compatible with the buildings and environment with which it is 
visually related. 
(4) ?Architectural details should be incorporated as necessary to relate the new with the old and to 
preserve and enhance the inherent architectural characteristics of the area.

(2) ?Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated. 
(3) ?Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant damage to its physical 
integrity. 
(4) ?The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed site and adjacent properties. 
    The applicant shall document, through photographs, the property in its original location prior to 
removal and provide copies to the board.

Sec. 25-111. - Demolition of a historic resource where a certificate of designation has been issued. 
    No certificate of appropriateness shall be issued for the demolition of a historic resource issued a 
certificate of designation unless the applicant demonstrates by the preponderance of the evidence that 
undue economic hardship or unusual and compelling circumstances support such a demolition. 
(1) ?Unusual and compelling circumstances. 
a. ?Criteria. In situations where the applicant claims that unusual and compelling 
circumstances require the demolition of an individually designated historic resource the 
historic preservation board shall consider the following criteria: 
1. ?The building or structure is of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet 
national standards for additional designation on the National Register of Historic 
Places or as a National Historic Landmark. 
2. ?The building or structure is of such design, craftsmanship or material that it could be 
reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense. 
3. ?The building or structure is one (1) of the last remaining examples of its kind in the city 
or the region. 
4. ?Retention of the building or structure would promote the general welfare of the city by 
providing an opportunity for the study of local history, architecture or design. 
5. ?Definite plans exist for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, 
and if the plans will have a positive effect on the character of the surrounding area. 
6. ?A reasonable effort was made to relocate the building or structure. 
7. ?Demolition of the designated building or structure has been recommended or ordered 
by the appropriate public agency due to unsafe conditions. 
b. ?Action by board. On applications for certificates of appropriateness for demolition claiming 
an unusual and compelling circumstance, the board may approve, approve with conditions 
or deny the request or may suspend action to allow further study of the matter for a period 
not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the filing of the application. 
The length of the delay shall be determined by the board based upon the probable time 
required to arrange a possible alternative to demolition. 
During the stay of demolition, the board may take such steps as it deems necessary to 
preserve the building or structure concerned in accordance with the purposes of this 
chapter. Such steps may include but shall not be limited to consultation with civic groups, 
public agencies and interested citizens; recommendations for acquisition of property by 
public or private bodies or agencies; and exploration of the possibility of moving the 
structure or building. 
(2) ?Undue economic hardship. 
a. ?Criteria. In situations where, by reason of particular site conditions and restraints or 
circumstances applicable to the property owner, strict enforcement of this chapter will deny 
the owner economically viable or reasonable use of a property, the applicant shall submit 
the following information to the historic preservation officer: 
1. ?For all property: 
i. ?The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the party from whom 
the property was purchased. 
ii. ?The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon according to the two 
(2) most recent county property appraiser's assessments. 
iii. ?Real estate taxes for the previous two (2) years. 
iv. ?Annual debt service, if any, for the previous two (2) years. 
v. ?All appraisals obtained within the previous two (2) years by the owner or 
applicant in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of the property.

i. ?Annual gross income from the property for the previous two (2) years. 
ii. ?Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two (2) years. 
iii. ?Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two (2) years. 
The board reserves the right to solicit expert testimony. 
b. ?Action by board. 
1. ?Review. The board shall review all evidence and information submitted by the 
applicant and make a determination as to whether the denial of a certificate of 
appropriateness for demolition will deprive the owner of reasonable use of, or 
economically viable return on, the property in question. 
2. ?Denial. If the board decides that denial of the proposed action does not or will not 
deprive the owner reasonable use of or an economically viable return on the property, 
then the certificate of appropriateness for demolition will be denied. 
3. ?Approval. In the event the board finds without approval of the proposed work all 
reasonable use of, or economic return from, a historic building or structure which has 
been issued a certificate of designation will be denied a property owner, then the 
application shall be delayed for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days 
from the date of filing of the application. 
During this period the board shall investigate alternatives to preserve the property. 
Such alternatives may include, but are not limited to a reduction in real property taxes, 
financial assistance, changes in zoning, public purchase, and/or code exemptions. 
If by the end of the period for the stay of demolition the board has found that, without 
approval of the demolition, the property cannot be put to a reasonable use or the 
owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return therefrom, then the board shall 
issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. 
(3) ?Documentation of buildings. The board shall, as a condition to approval of such demolition, 
have the power to require the documentation of buildings slated for such demolition by 
photographs and measured drawings. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-112. - Maintenance of designated historic resources and demolition by neglect. 
    The owner of any historic resource, whether vacant or inhabited, shall be required to properly 
maintain and preserve such historic resource in accordance with standards set forth herein. For purposes 
of this article, demolition by neglect is defined as any failure to comply with the minimum required 
maintenance standards of this section or chapter 5, article IV, Minimum Housing Code, of the Code of 
Ordinances shall be used to prevent demolition by neglect, whether deliberate or inadvertent. 
(1) ?Required minimum maintenance standards. It is the intent of this article to preserve from 
deliberate or inadvertent neglect, the historic resource, whether vacant or inhabited. All such 
resources shall be maintained according to minimum maintenance standards, preserved 
against decay, deterioration and demolition and shall be free from structural defects through 
prompt and corrective action to any physical defect which jeopardizes the building's historic, 
architectural and structural integrity; 
(2) ?Notice, administrative enforcement and remedial action. If, in the opinion of the board, HPO, or 
the code enforcement officer, any historic resource falls into a state of disrepair so as to 
potentially jeopardize its structural stability and/or architectural integrity, and/or the safety of the 
public and surrounding structures, or fails to satisfy any of the required minimum maintenance 
standards above, then the aforementioned officials shall have right of entry onto the subject 
property and may inspect the subject property after forty-eight (48) hours' notice to the owner of 
intent to inspect. 
a. ?In the event the property owner refuses entry of any city official onto the subject property, 
the city may file an appropriate action compelling the property owner to allow such officials 
access to the subject property for an inspection. 
b. ?Upon completion of the inspection of the subject property, a report delineating the findings 
of such inspection, as well as any remedial action required to address any violation of the 
required minimum maintenance standards, shall be immediately transmitted to the property 
owner and to the board. 
(3) ?Code enforcement action—Additional requirements. In any proceeding of the unsafe structures 
board, the code enforcement board or special magistrate involving a historic resource the 
regulatory body shall be instructed as follows: 
a. ?That the subject of the code enforcement action is a historic resource and that these 
additional requirements apply to their deliberations. 
b. ?Every reasonable effort shall be made to stop and reverse any deterioration of the historic 
resource. 
c. ?Demolition of a historic shall be ordered only in situations involving an immediate public 
safety risk and shall be required to meet the following conditions: 
1. ?A structural engineer, with a demonstrated knowledge and expertise in remediation of 
historic resources, determines that the structure cannot be reasonably repaired; and 
2. ?The HPO determines that there are no viable alternatives to demolition. 
d. ?The board shall be notified, according to notification procedures herein, in advance of any 
code enforcement hearings regarding a historic resource. 
e. ?The regulatory body may order remedial action by the city to prevent demolition by neglect, 
including, but not limited to roof repairs, moisture intrusion remediation or structural 
shoring. The procedure and cost of said action shall be as proscribed in section 5-54 of the 
City Code of Ordinances, including lien of the subject property to recover the city costs to 
protect the historic resource. 
(4) ?Emergency conditions; designated properties. In any case where it is determined that there are 
emergency conditions dangerous to life, health or property affecting a historic resource an order 
to remedy these conditions without the approval of the board or issuance of a required 
certificate of appropriateness may be issued, provided that the HPO and the chair of the board 
has been consulted. The building official shall provide the board with adequate photographic 
evidence and a professional engineer's opinion as to the conditions warranting the demolition. 
(5) ?Reconstruction. A historic resource that is substantially destroyed by fire, storm or other hazard 
may be reconstructed accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards. 
Notwithstanding the general requirements of the zoning district in which the resource is located, 
the reconstruction may be approved with the same setbacks, step backs and height from the 
finished floor as the resource it is replacing.

ARTICLE V. - EXCAVATION CERTIFICATE 


Sec. 25-141. - Activities requiring certificate. 
    A certificate to excavate issued by the historic preservation board shall be required for proposed 
earth-disturbing activities that will have an adverse impact on any historic resource designated as 
archaeologically significant as provided for in article III of this chapter. No earth-disturbing activity may 
occur within the boundaries of a designated archaeological site until a certificate to excavate is issued by 
the board. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-142. - Determination of adverse impact. 
    The owner of a designated historic resource with archaeological significance shall confer with the 
historic preservation officer prior to any earth-disturbing activity within the established boundaries of a 
designated archaeological site. A determination shall be made by the historic preservation officer as to 
whether or not an application for a certificate to excavate is warranted. Said determination shall be based 
on whether or not there is a substantial adverse impact on the designated resource and the potential for 
future impacts as a result of the proposed action. The historic preservation officer may request the 
following information to assist in making the determination: 
(1) ?Site plans, including landscape plans, where applicable. 
(2) ?A description of any earth-disturbing activity associated with the project, including depth of 
excavation and area of coverage. 
(3) ?Any other information required by the historic preservation officer deemed necessary for 
making an accurate determination. 
(4) ?An archaeological test survey, conducted by a professional archaeologist who meets the 
professional qualification standards as defined by 36 CFR 61 and the Florida Department of 
State, Division of Historical Resources, to further evaluate the extent and significance of 
archaeological deposits. 
    If the historic preservation officer makes a determination that the proposed activity will have a 
substantial adverse impact on a designated archaeological site, an application for a certificate to excavate 
must be filed with the historic preservation officer. If a determination of no substantial adverse impact is 
made, the project may proceed without action from the board. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-143. - Application. 
    Application to the historic preservation board for a certificate to excavate shall be made on a form 
supplied by the historic preservation officer. Said application shall be filed with said officer upon the 
determination made by the historic preservation officer as outlined in section 25-142. Applications shall be 
accompanied by full plans and specifications indicating areas of work that involve earth-disturbing activity. 
Also, a notarized authorization allowing such activity by the owner shall be provided, if the applicant is 
other than the owner or attorney for the owner. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-144. - Public hearing and notice of proposed certificate. 
    The historic preservation board shall hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days after the filing of the 
application for a certificate to excavate with the historic preservation officer and after due public notice for 
each application for a certificate to excavate. The board shall also send by certified mail a notice of the 
proposed certificate to excavate to the owner at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date of public 
hearing, or the owner shall otherwise acknowledge notice to the historic preservation officer. At the public 
hearing, the historic preservation officer shall recommend approval, denial or approval with conditions of 
the certificate to excavate. The historic preservation officer shall transmit to the owner his 
recommendations on the application prior to the public hearing. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-145. - Action by historic preservation board. 
    After the public hearing, the historic preservation board shall approve, deny or approve with 
conditions each application for an excavation certificate. Copies of the decision shall be mailed to the 
applicant and the property owner within ten (10) days of the decision. Unless appealed, the decision of 
the board shall be the final administrative decision. After the issuance of a certificate to excavate, no 
change may be made in the proposed work without resubmittal of an application. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-146. - Mitigation of adverse impacts. 
    The historic preservation board shall not approve any application for a certificate to excavate that 
does not provide for the mitigation of adverse impacts on a designated historic resource with 
archaeological significance. Upon receipt of a complete application, the board shall review the proposed 
project to determine the type of archaeological work that is necessary to mitigate the adverse impact of 
the proposed earth-disturbing activity on the affected archaeological resource. After receiving a complete 
application, a decision shall be made by the board as to the type of mitigation method appropriate for the 
project. The board shall select one (1) or more of the following alternatives: 
(1) ?Site monitoring. This method includes the visual inspection of a property by the historic 
preservation officer and/or a professional archaeologist for evidence of artifacts or structural 
remains unearthed during the development process or earth-disturbing activity. If significant 
archaeological deposits are unearthed during project-related activity, work may be halted by the 
board, with the recommendation for such action from the historic preservation officer or a 
professional archaeologist, for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the 
date of the filing of the application. This time delay may be used to conduct any necessary 
archaeological work. At the end of the delay, the applicant will be allowed to continue the project 
as planned. 
(2) ?Subsurface testing. This method includes limited sampling prior to the development process. 
Work of this nature must be conducted and/or supervised by a professional archaeologist. In 
situations where additional effort is warranted, the board may request the applicant to conduct 
full-scale excavation and/or in-situ preservation. 
(3) ?Full-scale excavation. If the area to be adversely impacted by the proposed project contains 
significant archaeological deposits as determined through documentary records and/or 
subsurface testing, a full-scale excavation may be warranted. This action requires a team 
supervised by a professional archaeologist. The time required for excavation will depend on the 
type and size of site, extent of soil disturbance, definition of the site made during the excavation, 
and weather conditions, but shall not exceed three hundred sixty-five (365) days in duration. 
(4) ?In-situ preservation. This method should be utilized, if feasible, as an alternative for full-scale 
excavation in projects that involve significant archaeological deposits. In-situ preservation is 
defined as maintaining the archaeological site in an undisturbed state at its present location 
such as through an easement, preserve, passive park or designated open space area, or by 
sealing the site under pavement and/or fill. Specific boundaries are identified and all 
development activity and earth-disturbing activity occurs outside of the identified boundaries. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-147. - Reporting requirements for archaeological work. 
    Any person conducting archaeological work in accordance with this chapter shall complete a Florida 
Site File form and a written report that meets the guidelines of the Florida Department of State, Division of 
Historical Resources. A copy of the Florida Site File form and the report will be provided to the historic 
preservation board and the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources prior to the 
issuance of a certificate to excavate. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-148. - Assistance with costs of archaeological work. 
    The historic preservation board may assist the applicant in obtaining funding or volunteer assistance 
for archaeological work. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-027, § 2, 11-7-2012) 


Sec. 25-149. - Correlation with other permits. 
    A certificate to excavate shall be considered prerequisite to the issuance of any other permits 
required by ordinance of the city commission. The issuance of a certificate to excavate shall not relieve 
the applicant from obtaining other permits or approvals required by the city.
