PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Englewood, Colorado. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Vice President of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Loucrishia A. Ellis, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs. 
ORDINANCE NO. 37 
SERIES OF 2000 
An Ordinance Adopting the Recodification of the "Englewood Municipal Code 2000" Incorporating therein the General Ordinances of the City of Englewood, Colorado Including Codes Adopted by Reference; Providing For Penalties For Violation of the Provisions of said Code and Setting Forth the Penalties Provided for in said Code; and Providing for the Effective Date of said Code. 
Now, Therefore, be it Ordained by the City Council of the City of Englewood, Colorado, as Follows: 
    Section 1. The City Council of the City of Englewood, Colorado hereby authorizes the adoption and recodification of the "Englewood Municipal Code 2000" incorporating therein the general ordinances of the City of Englewood, Colorado including Codes adopted by reference; providing for penalties for violation of the provisions of said Code and setting forth the penalties provided for in said Code; and providing for the effective date of said Code. 
    Section 2. The word "Code" may be used as an abbreviation for the "Englewood Municipal Code 2000." 
    Section 3. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be construed as a limitation on the power of the City Council to change obvious typographical or composition errors in the Code without change of legal effect. 
    Section 4. From time to time after the effective date of this Ordinance, the City Clerk is hereby authorized to codify ordinances amending the said "Englewood Municipal Code 2000" and to have the same printed as supplements or substitute pages therefore. 
    Section 5. This Ordinance shall become effective on the 10th day of July, 2000 at 12:01 a.m. 
    Section 6. Originally Distribution of Handbills was under Title 15, Chapter 4. Ord. 39-98 put Handbills into 7-6F-13. Later, Ord. 43-99 also assigned 7-6F-13 to Parental Responsibility for Graffiti Offenses. Distribution of Handbills shall be renumbered 7-6F-14. 
    Section 7. Ord. 11-97 did not assign a paragraph a title, chapter and section number to the paragraph entitled "More Stringent City Standards Prevail." It shall now be numbered Title 5, Chapter 5, Section 5. 
    Section 8. Because of numbering problems created by Ord. 46-97 and 57-96, 5-12-5, 5-12-6 and 5-12-7, shall be placed at the end of Title 5, entitled "Sales and Service" and renumbered E.M.C. 5-29-1, 5-29-2 and 5-29-3. 
    Section 9. E.M.C. Section 6-6-2 was repealed by Ord. 15-98, and the definition of recyclable materials shall be moved to 15-1-2. 
    Section 10. Ord. 43-99 added Section 7-6E-9 on Possessing of Graffiti Materials by Minors, but Ord. 11-97 already had assigned 7-6E-9 to Prohibited Massage on Minors. Since there was a related section on Graffiti next in sequence, Prohibited Massage on Minors shall be renumbered 7-6E-12. 
    Section 11. Ord. 30-97 added Section 7-6E-6 on Body Piercing, but there already was a 7-6E-6 on Curfew, thus Body Piercing shall be renumbered to 7-6E-11. 
    Section 12. Ord. 24-97 did not repeal Title 7, Chapter 3 Purchaser of Valuable Articles. Title 7, Chapter 3, Purchaser of Valuable Articles is hereby repealed. Purchaser of Valuable Articles shall be renumbered as E.M.C. Title 5, Chapter 23. 
    Section 13. Ord. 23-97 adds a paragraph C, and Ord. 24-97 adds paragraph E, but D was omitted. Paragraph D shall be reserved. 
    Section 14. E.M.C. 16-4-5-(N)(1)(e)(2) "If entrance faces rear: 3 feet," was a typo. Change to be consistent with similar requirements in other zone districts. Should read: "If entrance faces rear: 6 feet." 
    Section 15. E.M.C. 16-4-12-(C)(7)(a)(2) lists an R-1 zone district. Since there is not an R- I zone district that term shall be deleted. 
    Section 16. E.M.C. 12-2-1 (D) (15): National Categorical Pretreatment Standard lists only a part of the definition for National Pretreatment Standard, which is a broader definition. That definition shall now read as follows: 
E.M.C. 12-2-1(D) Abbreviations (15) NPS National Pretreatment Standards. 
E.M.C. 12-2-5(C)(2) NPS (appears three times in this paragraph.) 
    Section 17. In the 1988 UBC a garage, for a single family dwelling, was designated as a Type M occupancy. When the 1994 UBC was adopted, the occupancy designations were reassigned to match the occupancy designations in the other model codes (BOCA and SCCBI). The Type M was changed to a Type U and this change should have been reflected in the EMC at the time the 1994 UBC was adopted. This shall be corrected. 
    Section 18. 16-5-30: Satellite Dish Ordinance: contains typos and shall now read as follows: 16-5-30(B) Applicability of Ordinance Standards 
1.  a.  Residential Districts: R-1-A, R-1-B, R-1-C, R-2, R-2-C, R-2-C/S.P.S., R-3 and R-4 
b.  Commercial Districts: B-1 and B-2 
c.  Industrial Districts: I-1 and I-2 
    Section 19. E.M.C. 16-8-1 Sign, Private Sale or Event. This definition was added as part of the general revision of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance in 1985 (Ord. 26-85). The addition of "Sale or Event" corrects a typo. 
    Section 20. Penalty. The Penalty Provision of E.M.C. Section 1-4-1 shall apply to each and every violation of this Ordinance. 
    Section 21. The "Englewood Municipal Code 2000", or any chapter or section thereof, may be proved by a copy thereof, certified by the City Clerk of the City of Englewood, Colorado under the Seal of the City; or when printed in book or pamphlet form and purporting to be printed by authority of the City, the same shall be received in evidence in all courts without further proof of the existence and regularity of the enactments of any particular ordinance and of said Code. 
    Section 22. Pursuant to and in compliance with 31-16-203 Colorado Revised Statutes, the City Clerk of the City of Englewood is hereby authorized and directed to publish notice of a public hearing on the adoption and enactment of the "Englewood Municipal Code 2000" to the extent and pursuant to the schedule for such publications prescribed in 31-16-203 Colorado Revised Statutes, said public hearing to be held in the Council Chambers, City Hall, 3400 South Elati Street, Englewood, Arapahoe County, Colorado, at 7:30 p.m. on May 15, 2000. 
    Section 23. At frequent intervals after the approval of this Ordinance, all ordinances of a general and permanent nature passed and approved during the preceding period shall be revised, arranged and prepared for duplication in the form of looseleaf supplements, reprinting the page or pages of the Code affected, removing the amended or obsolete provisions and inserting the new provisions. 
    Section 24. And all additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Council to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code so that reference to the "Englewood Municipal Code 2000" shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
    Section 25. In case of the amendment of any section of the Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in Section 1-4-1 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein. 
    Section 26. A copy of such Code shall be kept on file in the Office of the City Clerk, preserved in looseleaf form, or in such other form as the City Clerk, may consider most expedient. It shall be the express duty of the City Clerk or someone authorized by the City Clerk, to insert in their designated places all amendments or ordinances which indicate the intention of the City Council to make the same a part of such Code when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from such Code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed by the City Council. This copy of such Code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine the same and shall be considered the official "Englewood Municipal Code 2000." 
    Section 27. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the ordinances of the City of Englewood, Colorado to be misrepresented thereby. Any person, firm or corporation violating this section shall be punished as provided in Section 1-4-1 of the "Englewood Municipal Code 2000."

The City Clerk shall, within forty-eight (48) hours after the filing of said affidavit, mail a copy of said affidavit, by certified mail, to the elected officer sought to be recalled, who may file with the City Clerk a sworn statement in defense of the charges made against him. After the affidavit has been filed, the City Clerk shall authorize a petition for recall of the elected officer which shall include the statement in defense of the petition if so requested by the person sought to be recalled prior to the authorization by the City Clerk. The City Clerk's authorization shall not constitute an approval of the form or contents of the petition but, rather, shall commence the running of the time periods provided hereafter. 
    The authorized petition may be circulated and signed by registered electors who would be entitled to vote for the successor of the incumbent sought to be recalled. For recall of any elected officer, said petition must be signed by registered electors who would be entitled to vote for a successor of the incumbent sought to be recalled, numbering at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the registered electors voting for all the candidates for the elected officer's respective office in the last preceding general municipal election. 
    The recall petition shall be filed with the requisite information and signatures with the City Clerk within sixty (60) days after authorization by the City Clerk. Failure to file a petition within this period shall render the recall petition null and void. If said petition is filed within the time specified and is proper in all respects, the Council shall set a date for a recall election to be held not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days after filing of the recall petition unless within said period of time a general municipal election, a special municipal election or a general state election is to be held. 
    Should a general municipal election, a special municipal election, or a general state election be held within the 60th to 120th day after filing of the recall petition, the recall election shall be held in conjunction therewith. At such recall election, the question of the proposed recall of the elected officer shall be submitted to the registered electors who would be entitled to vote for the successor of the incumbent sought to be recalled. 
    The ballot upon which such proposed recall is submitted shall set forth the following question: 
SHALL (NAME OF PERSON AGAINST WHOM RECALL PETITION IS FILED) BE RECALLED FROM THE OFFICE OF (TITLE OF OFFICE)? 
    Following such question shall be the words "Yes" and "No". In the event that an officer is recalled by a majority vote of those voting on the question, the office shall be deemed vacant and shall be filled at an election called by Council not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the recall election unless within said period of time a general municipal election, a special municipal election, or a general state election is to be held. 
    Should a general municipal election, a special municipal election, or a general state election be held within the 60th to 120th day after the recall election, the election to fill the vacancy shall be held in conjunction therewith.

(Code 1985,  1-4-5) 
1-4-6: - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. 44-14,  1, adopted Aug. 18, 2014, deleted  1-4-6, entitled "City Jail; Confinements", which derived from Code 1985,  1-4-6; and Ord. 00-7. 
1-4-7: - Restitution to Victims of Ordinance Violations. 
A.  Upon conviction of a defendant in any offense in which the conduct of the defendant resulted in loss or damage to the property of another or cause bodily injury to another, the court, shall, as a condition of probation or as a mitigating factor in imposing any punishment, provide that the defendant make restitution to the victim of his conduct for the actual damages which were sustained. Such restitution shall be ordered by the court as a condition of probation or as a condition of mitigating any punishment. The amount of such restitution shall be based on the actual pecuniary damages sustained by the victim, the ability of the defendant to pay and the defendant's obligation to support his dependents and other family obligations. Such restitution may be paid to the office of the City Attorney for deposit into the City's treasury and repayment therefrom to the victim. If the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that such restitution shall work an undue hardship on the defendant and his family, the court may waive the making of such restitution, in whole or in part. The court is authorized to monitor such payment of restitution by setting penalty hearing at reasonable intervals to receive reports of partial payments made and, for this purpose, may continue the penalty hearings. If the defendant fails to make restitution as ordered by the court, any sentence imposed will include unsuspended confinement of not less than thirty (30) days for an adult defendant. The court has the authority to delay imposing a punishment until either the defendant has satisfied the paying of restitution or the court has determined that no restitution will be paid. The requirement of restitution shall be deemed satisfied if the defendant presents a signed "release" from the victim to the Clerk of the Court upon a form provided by the prosecuting attorney. The Clerk and/or the prosecuting attorney may contact the victim to verify the authenticity of the execution of the "release" prior to satisfaction of the requirement of restitution. 
B.  When as a result of a plea bargain agreement or when a defendant is ordered to make restitution pursuant to subsection A above, the City Attorney's Office supervising the collections of such restitution may assess a reasonable charge to the defendant upon receiving of a bad check as restitution payment, such charge to be based upon the reasonable cost of processing a request for and obtaining the payment due from the defendant. For this section, a "bad check" means a check or similar site order for the payment of money which is dishonored by the bank or other drawee because the issuer does not have sufficient funds upon deposit with the bank or other drawee to pay the check or order upon presentation within thirty (30) days after issue. 
C.  Upon a determination by the court that the defendant had a liability insurance policy in effect at the time of the injury or the damage or loss of property resulted to another and such injury, damage, or loss was reported to such insurance policy company, and the identity of that insurance policy and company has been made known to the victim, the court shall find that further restitution is not required, provided that the liability insurance policy was equal to or greater than the amount of injury, damage, or loss. 
D.  The terms and provisions of this section shall not preempt the rights, if any, of persons to seek or resist civil remedies in any court of law. 
E.  Both the defendant and the victim, personally or by an attorney, have standing to present evidence and argument to the court on the issue of restitution, but the court has complete discretion to limit such evidence and argument pursuant to its own rules and may choose not to conduct a restitution hearing separate from the defendant's sentencing. 
F.  Englewood Municipal Court shall be responsible for collecting restitution payments from defendants found guilty of ordinance violations and disbursing the same to the victims.

Widner, 13133 E. Arapahoe Road, Suite 100, Centennial, Colorado 80112. Bob's Rules of Order (2013), including those amendments set forth below, shall govern the procedure of the meetings of the City Council in all cases where applicable and where not inconsistent with the Charter or the rules and procedures herein fixed by the Council or other provisions of this Code. One (1) copy of Bob's Rules of Order [version 1-18], with amendments as adopted, shall be provided to each member of the City Council, the City Manager, the City Attorney, and the City Clerk upon adoption, and at the first meeting in January thereafter, and shall also be made available to the public for inspection at the office of the City Clerk, and may be posted to the City's website with the permission of the author. 
    All amendments as set forth herein shall be incorporated into Bob's Rules of Order (2013) and known as "Bob Rules of Order [version 1-18]". Version numbers shall be updated to correspond to each modification to the rules of order adopted by the City Council. 
    Amendments to Bob's Rules of Order (2013) shall be as follows: 
1.  Inclusion of a privileged motion entitled "Point of Decorum". 
a.  Point of decorum is a request of a member, requiring a second, for the body as a whole to review an act of a member for conformance with the rules of decorum, as such rules have been established, and adopted by, the body as a whole. It shall require approval by a majority of the quorum present. It shall not be debatable. 
b.  An example of the use of a point of decorum shall also be included. 
2.  Modification of the rule regarding abstention. 
Abstentions. Abstentions shall not be counted as either a vote in favor or against the proposition before the body. 
  A member declaring a conflict of interest in regard to a matter pending before the body and thereafter abstaining from the discussion and vote may not leave the room and does not change quorum for purposes of establishing a valid meeting of the body. 
  If, after a member declares a conflict of interest, the remaining members of the body eligible to act upon the matter do not equal a quorum, the matter should be tabled to the next regular meeting at which a quorum of members is available to decide the matter, unless immediate action is necessary and proper. This rule shall be construed to weigh against allowing less than a quorum of the membership to act upon a matter before the body.

When it satisfactorily appears to the Municipal Judge that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a violation of the Municipal Code has occurred or is occurring, and that there is probable cause to believe that a search of the privately owned structure, premises or property will disclose evidence of the means or the fruits of such violation. 
B.  Procedure for Issuance. An application for the issuance of a search warrant, authorized by the provisions of subsection A above shall be accompanied by one or more affidavits or, in lieu thereof, sworn testimony taken by the Judge to whom the application is made, which affidavits or testimony shall set forth the factual basis for the issuance thereof.

In the event that the complainant shall not appear at the trial or shall refuse to testify, such appearance bond shall automatically be forfeited to the City.

3.  Where a bond is forfeited, the surety on such bond shall pay the bond amount into the Municipal Court upon the date of forfeiture.

In addition thereto, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant may be issued forthwith. 
C.  Alternative Upon Failure to Appear. In the event any person fails to appear pursuant to a summons directing an appearance in the Municipal Court, the Municipal Judge may issue a warrant for the arrest of the defendant, or may accept the total amount of defendant's bond in lieu of a fine or jail sentence.

Effective January 1, 2012, the mortality assumption for calculation shall be a unisex rate that is fifty percent (50%) male, fifty percent (50%) female, taken from the 1994 group annuity mortality table. For the period July 1, 1999 to December 31, 2011, such mortality assumption shall be a unisex rate that is fifty percent (50%) male, fifty percent (50%) female, taken from the 1983 group annuity mortality table.

    The following shall not be considered a break in service: 
1.  A temporary lay-off because of an illness or for purposes of economy, suspension, or dismissal, followed by death, or reinstatement, reemployment or reappointment within one (1) year. 
2.  A formal Leave of Absence, duly approved by the City Manager for a specific period, followed by death or by reinstatement, reemployment or reappointment within thirty (30) days after termination of the Leave of Absence.

B.  After December 31, 2012, if a former Member returns to service as a Member the following rules shall apply to determine whether the Plan shall include ("restore") or shall not include ("cancel") the Member's Credited Service earned before the absence or interruption of service ("prior Credited Service") for purposes of determining the Member's Credited Service after his return. 
1.  For purposes of the five years of Credited Service required to become a Vested Member, the Plan will restore the Member's prior Credited Service only if the Member repays to the Plan the payment the Member received (if any) of Accumulated Contributions. Such repayment must equal the full Accumulated Contribution amount received by the Member from the Plan, plus interest at the rate of 3.5% on that amount from the date of receipt to the date of repayment. Full repayment must be made within 12 months of the Member's return to service as a Member and must be made by payroll deduction or by rollover from an IRA, qualified retirement plan or eligible governmental 457(b) plan acceptable to the Board, excluding after-tax contributions. If repayment is made by payroll deduction, the Member must make a one-time irrevocable election upon return to service as a Member, and the election must authorize payroll deduction of the required amount over a specific period (not to extend beyond 12 months of the Member's return to service as a Member). Although designated as Member contributions, the payroll deduction shall be picked up by the City as described in Code Section 414(h)(2). If less than the full repayment is made by payroll deduction due to termination of the Member's employment covered by this Plan within the 12 month repayment period, the amount repaid will be refunded. 
2.  For all other purposes, the Plan will restore Credited Service for a Member according to the following rules: 
a.  If the Member returns to service as a Member within five years of the date the Member's employment with the City terminated, the Plan will restore the Member's prior Credited Service only if the Member repays to the Plan the payment the Member received (if any) of Accumulated Contributions. Repayment must be made according to the same rules as described in the preceding paragraph 1. 
b.  If the Member returns to service as a Member after the fifth anniversary of the date the Member's employment with the City terminated (the "termination date"), the Plan will restore the Member's prior Credited Service only if the Member was a Vested Member on the termination date and the Member did not receive a payment of Accumulated Contributions from the Plan. 
    Members of the Plan as of January 1, 1987, who were previously covered by the Plan but, due to a prior termination of employment, received such a single-sum payment, and were then reemployed by the City regardless of the time that expired between their termination date and reemployment date, shall have until July 1, 1989, in order to elect to repay such single-sum amount and thereby avoid such actuarial reduction. The amount to be repaid shall be calculated as set forth and must be repaid by July 1, 1989. 
    Any former nonvested Employee who returns to service as an Employee more than five (5) years after his date of termination and who is a Member of the Plan as of January 1, 1987, shall have until September 30, 1987 to make written application to the Retirement Board to have his prior Credited Service, if any, restored. The Retirement Board shall review such application and shall determine on a nondiscriminatory basis, whether such prior Credited Service shall be restored, and shall inform the Member of its determination by December 31, 1987. 
    Any Member of the Plan who was an Employee on January 1, 1970 and who did not elect to become a Member of the Plan on January 1, 1970 pursuant to Subsection 2-10-3-1 hereof will, as of January 1, 1987, receive credit for all service prior to the date he actually became a Member of the Plan. Such a Member may elect in writing, prior to July 1, 1988, to pay a single sum amount determined on the basis of the amount of Accumulated Contributions that said Member would have accumulated in the Plan as of July 1, 1988 had he elected to become a Member of the Plan on January 1, 1970 and made the required contributions each year on the basis of compensation he received each year. If the Member elects not to pay the single sum amount, his Retirement Benefit determined under Subsection 3-4-7-1 hereof shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the single sum payment due as of July 1, 1988. 
(Ord. 39-12,  1) 
3-4-4-4: - Effect of Other Plans. 
    Credited Service shall not include any period on the basis of which a Retirement Benefit is payable under any other defined benefit retirement or pension plan to which the City made contributions, other than benefits payable under the Federal Social Security Act or the Volunteer Firefighters' Pension Fund. Credited Service shall not include any period of time for which the City contributes on behalf of an Exempt Employee to the ICMA-RC Plan or any other optional deferred compensation plan in lieu of this Plan, as provided in Subsection 3-4-3-2 hereof.

3-4-5-4: - Contributions for Periods of Qualified Military Service.

C.  Applicability. The provisions of this Section are applicable with respect to those otherwise eligible Members of the Plan whose election to participate in the DROP occurs on or after the effective date contained in this Subsection 3-4-7-8(A), hereof.

Effective on and after December 31, 2012, the Member contribution required by Section 3-4-5-1 shall be paid into the participating DROP Member's DROP account.

J.  Administration of DROP Assets. Participating DROP Members may direct their DROP money to any of the investment options approved by the Board for the DROP. There shall be no guaranteed rate of investment return on DROP deposits. Any losses, charges or expenses incurred by the participating DROP Member in such Member's DROP account by virtue of the investment options selected by the participating DROP Member, shall not be made up by the City or the Plan, but all of same shall be borne by the participating DROP Member. Transfers between investment options shall be in accordance with the rules and regulations of the DROP. A DROP account shall be established for each participating DROP Member. Such DROP account shall be adjusted, no less frequently than annually for contributions, distributions and net investment earnings and losses.

L.  Fees. If the DROP account shall be subject to any fees or charges of any kind, such fees or charges shall be charged to the participating DROP Member's account. 
M.  Form of Payment. For purposes of this Subsection 3-4-7-8 hereof, a "retiree" is a participating DROP Member who terminates employment or reaches the three-year limit for participation in the DROP. A retiree must choose one of the following forms of payment from the individual's DROP account:

(Ord. 39-12,  1) 
3-4-14-6: - Distribution.

B.

    Upon the subsequent vested termination of employment by such a Member, the Member shall be entitled to receive a Retirement Benefit based on i) his Credited Service prior to the date of his previous termination (except Credited Service lost under Subsection 3-4-4-3 hereof, ii) his Credited Service during the period of his reemployment (if any), and iii) in the case of a disabled Member, his Credited Service while disabled. In the case of reemployment, of a former Member who received, prior to his reemployment, any benefit payments (whether single sum or periodic) with respect to which Credited Service is restored hereunder, the Retirement Benefit payable upon his subsequent retirement shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of such payments, other than Disability Retirement Benefit payments, he received previously, unless such payment was a lump sum that was repaid under Subsection 3-4-4-3 hereof.

Neither the establishment of this Plan, nor any amendment or modification thereof, nor failure of the City to provide sufficient contributions to the same shall be construed as giving to any Member, or other person, any legal or equitable right against the City, or any officer or director thereof, or against the Retirement Board, or any member thereof. 
(Ord. 39-12,  1) 
3-4-17-3: - Direct Rollovers. 
A.  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution which exceeds $200.00 paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. If a distributee's direct rollover distribution is less than $500.00, the distributee may only elect to direct rollover 100 percent of the eligible rollover distribution. 
B.  Definitions: 
1.  Eligible Rollover Distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). For distributions made after December 31, 2006, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax Employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Sections 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code which is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code or to an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, provided such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon) including separate accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
2.  Eligible Retirement Plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), and annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relation order, as defined in Code Section 414(p). Effective January 1, 2008, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean a Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A(b), subject to any applicable limits described in Code Section 408A(c). 
3.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. 
4.  Direct Rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to one eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
5.  Waiver of 30-Day Notice for Cashouts of $5,000.00 ($3,500.00 Prior to January 1, 1998) or Less. An eligible rollover distribution may commence less than thirty (30) days after the notice required under Code Section 402(f) is given, provided that: 
a.  The Board clearly informs the Member that the Member has a right to a period of at least thirty (30) days after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a direct rollover, and 
b.  The Member, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a distribution. 
C.  Distribution to IRA of Non-Spouse Beneficiary. A Member's non-spouse Beneficiary may elect to have any portion of an eligible Plan distribution paid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Sections 401(c)(8)(B)(i) or (ii) of the Code that is established to receive the Plan distribution on behalf of the Beneficiary. For purposes of this Subsection C, a trust maintained for the benefit of one (1) or more designated beneficiaries may be the Beneficiary to the extent provided in rules prescribed by the Secretary of Treasury. If the Member dies after the Member's required beginning date as defined in Section 3-4-6-5 hereof, the required minimum distribution in the year of death may not be transferred according to this Subsection 3-4-17-3C. The requirements of Code Section 402(c)(11) apply to distributions under this Subsection 3-4-17-3C.

    Each active employee who is a Member including any employee currently receiving benefits under the City's long-term disability contract, and each Vested Member shall have the option of converting from membership in this Plan to membership in the money purchase plan. The application to convert must be made in writing, on or before July 15, 2001. Furthermore, the Member must complete the waiver and release documents as specified in Section 3-4-18-2. 
(Ord. 39-12,  1) 
3-4-18-2: - Waiver and Release Requirement. 
    Each eligible Member under Sections 3-4-3-2B or 3-4-18-1, who wishes to exercise the option of converting membership to the money purchase plan must sign a waiver and release within the timeframes specified by the Board and in a form acceptable to the Board, waiving all rights to a defined benefit pension from this Plan and releasing the City and Board from any liability to the Member and/or his or her Beneficiaries for such a defined benefit pension or any claim based on the conversion to the money purchase plan. Said election shall be irrevocable unless the Employee changes status from an Exempt Employee to a non-exempt employee, in which case such Employee may elect within sixty (60) days of the change in status to again become a Member of this Plan. Such an election to again become a Member of this Plan is permitted only if the money purchase pension plan requires the same Member Contribution as Section 3-4-5-1 requires for this Plan. In the event an Employee rejoins this Plan, the provisions of Section 3-4-4-3 shall determine whether the Employee's prior Credited Service shall be restored. Funds transferred to the money purchase plan shall not be transferred back to this Plan. 
(Ord. 39-12,  1) 
3-4-18-3: - Transfer of Funds. 
    Each eligible Member under Sections 3-4-3-2B or 3-4-18-1, who chooses to exercise the option to convert his or her membership to the money purchase plan shall have a determinable amount transferred to the money purchase plan. The amount transferred on behalf of each such Member is the actuarial equivalent present value (which shall include an adjustment if the Member qualifies for Special Early Retirement or Regular Early Retirement as of the date the Member changes status for a Member described in Section 3-4-3-2B and is July 30, 2001, for a Member described in Section 3-4-18-1), as of the date of transfer of the Member's Accrued Benefit. For purposes of this Section 3-4-18-3, the term "actuarial equivalent present value" shall be based on an interest rate assumption of seven and one-half percent (7.5%) and the mortality assumption of a unisex rate that is fifty percent (50%) male, fifty percent (50%) female, taken from the 1994 group annuity mortality table (except that the 1983 group annuity mortality table applies for transfers before January 1, 2012). The date of transfer of the Member's Accrued Benefit shall be as soon as practicable after the election date for a Member described in Section 3-4-3-2B, and August 31, 2001, or as soon as practicable thereafter, for a Member described in Section 3-6-18-1.

With respect to transactions consummated on or after January 1, 1986, in lieu of the procedure provided for in subsection A1 of this Section, the taxpayer may elect a hearing of the City's final decision on a deficiency notice or claim for refund pursuant to procedure set forth in this Section. 
a.  As used in this Section, "State hearing" means a hearing before the Executive Director of the Department of Revenue or delegate thereof as provided in Section 29-2-106.1(3), C.R.S. 
b.  When the City asserts that sales or use taxes are due in an amount greater than the amount paid by a taxpayer, the City shall mail a deficiency notice to the taxpayer by certified mail. The deficiency notice shall state the additional sales and use taxes due. The deficiency notice shall contain notification, in clear and conspicuous type, that the taxpayer has the right to elect a State hearing on the deficiency pursuant to Section 29-2-106.1(3), C.R.S. The taxpayer shall also have the right to elect a State hearing on the City's denial of such taxpayer's claim for a refund of sales or use tax paid. 
c.  The taxpayer shall request the State hearing within thirty (30) days after the taxpayer's exhaustion of local remedies. The taxpayer shall have no right to such hearing if he/she has not exhausted local remedies or if he/she fails to request such hearing within the time period provided. For purposes of this subsection, "exhaustion of local remedies" means: 
(1)  The taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before the City and the City has held such hearing and issued a final decision thereon. Such hearing shall be informal and no transcript, rules of evidence, or filing of briefs shall be required; but the taxpayer may elect to submit a brief, in which case the City may submit a brief. The City shall hold such hearing and issue the final decision thereon within ninety (90) days after the City's receipt of the taxpayer's written request therefor, except the City may extend such period if the delay in holding the hearing or issuing the decision thereon was occasioned by the taxpayer, but, in any such event, the City shall hold such hearing and issue the decision thereon within one hundred eighty (180) days of the taxpayer's request in writing therefor; or 
(2)  The taxpayer has timely requested in writing a hearing before the City and the City has failed to hold such hearing or has failed to issue a final decision thereon within the time periods prescribed in subsection B1c(1) of this Section. 
d.  If a taxpayer has exhausted his/her local remedies as provided in subsection B1c of this Section, the taxpayer may request a State hearing on such deficiency notice or claim for refund, and such request shall be made and such hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as set forth in Section 29-2-106.1(3) through (7), C.R.S. 
e.  If the deficiency notice or claim for refund involves only the City, in lieu of requesting a State hearing, the taxpayer may appeal such deficiency or denial of a claim for refund to the District Court of the County of Arapahoe as provided in Section 29-2-106.1(8), C.R.S., provided the taxpayer complies with the procedures set forth in subsection B1c of this Section. 
f.  Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the taxpayer from pursuing judicial review of a final decision of the City as otherwise provided in this Chapter. 
2.  With respect to transactions consummated on or after January 1, 1986, within fifteen (15) days after filing a notice of appeal as provided in subsection B1e of this Section, the taxpayer shall file with the District Court a surety bond in twice the amount of the taxes, interest, and other charges stated in the final decision by the City which are contested on appeal. The taxpayer may, at his/her option, satisfy the surety bond requirement by a savings account or deposit in or a certificate of deposit issued by a State or national bank or by a State or Federal savings and loan association, in accordance with the provisions of Section 11-35-101(1), C.R.S., equal to twice the amount of the taxes, interest, and other charges stated in the final decision by the City. 
3.  The taxpayer may, at his/her option, deposit the disputed amount with the City in lieu of posting a surety bond. If such amount is so deposited, no further interest shall accrue on the deficiency contested during the pendency of the action. At the conclusion of the action, after appeal to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals or after the time for such appeal has expired, the funds deposited shall be, at the direction of the Court, either retained by the City and applied against the deficiency or returned in whole or in part to the taxpayer with interest at the rate imposed pursuant to subsection 4-4-8C3 of this Chapter. No claim for refund of amounts deposited with the City need be made by the taxpayer in order for such amounts to be repaid in accordance with the direction of the Court. 
4.  Any person claiming to have paid a tax for the purchase or use of tangible personal property in excess of the rates established by this Chapter, may apply for a refund of said excess in the manner prescribed above. 
5.  Refund Not Assignable: The right of any person to a refund under this Chapter shall not be assignable, and application for refund must be made by the same person who purchased or used the goods and who paid the tax thereon, as shown by the invoice of the sale thereof or other appropriate document. 
6.  The City Manager or designee shall have the authority to waive part or all of any penalty and/or interest assessed if the circumstances deem such.

4-4-11: - Examinations of Returns; Refunds, Deficiencies. 
    As soon as practicable after any sales or use tax return is filed, the City shall examine it, and if it then appears that the correct amount of tax to be remitted is greater or less than that shown in the return, the tax shall be recomputed. 
    If the amount paid exceeds that which is due, the excess shall be refunded or credited against any subsequent remittance from the same taxpayer. 
    If the amount paid is less than the amount due, the difference, together with interest thereon at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the time the return was due, shall be paid by the vendor within fifteen (15) days after written notice and demand to him from the City.

The City shall have power to administer oaths to any person in the course of such investigations or hearing. 
B.  Coordinated Audit Procedures. 
1.  Coordinated Audit. 
a.  Any taxpayer licensed in this City pursuant to this Chapter of the Englewood Municipal Code 1985, and holding a similar sales tax license in at least four (4) other Colorado municipalities that administer their own sales tax collection, may request a coordinated audit as provided herein. 
b.  Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of notice of an intended audit by any municipality that administers its own sales tax collection, the taxpayer may provide the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written request for a coordinated audit indicating the municipality from which the notice of intended audit was received and the name of the official who issued such notice. Such request shall include a list of those Colorado municipalities utilizing local collection of their sales tax in which the taxpayer holds a current sales tax license and a declaration that the taxpayer will sign waiver of any passage-of-time base limited upon this City's right to recover tax owed by the vendor for the audit period. 
c.  Except as provided in subsection 4-4-12B1g, any taxpayer that submits a complete request for a coordinated audit and promptly signs a waiver of Section 4-4-17 of this Chapter, may be audited by this City during the twelve (12) months after such request is submitted only through a coordinated audit involving all municipalities electing to participate in such an audit. 
d.  If this City desires to participate in the audit of a taxpayer that submits a complete request for a coordinated audit pursuant to subsection B1c of this Section, the City shall so notify the municipality whose notice of audit prompted the taxpayer's request within ten (10) days after receipt of the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit. The City shall then cooperate with other participating municipalities in the development of arrangements for the coordinated audit, including arrangements of the time during which the coordinated audit, including arrangements of the time during which the coordinated audit will be conducted, the period of time to be covered by the audit, and a coordinated notice to the taxpayer of those records most likely to be required for completion of the coordinated audit. 
e.  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by this City, this City shall facilitate arrangements between it and other municipalities participating in the coordinated audit unless and until an official from some other participating municipality agrees to assume this responsibility. The City shall cooperate with other participating municipalities to, whenever practicable, minimize the number of auditors that will be present on the taxpayer's premises to conduct the coordinated audit on behalf of the participating municipalities. Information obtained by or on behalf of those municipalities participating in the coordinated audit may be shared only among such participating municipalities. 
f.  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by this City, this City shall, once arrangements for the coordinated audit between it and other participating municipalities are completed, provide written notice to the taxpayer of which municipalities will be participating, the period to be audited and the records most likely to be required by participating municipalities for completion of the coordinated audit. The City shall also propose a schedule for the coordinated audit. 
g.  The coordinated audit procedure set forth in this Section shall not apply: 
(1)  When the proposed audit is a jeopardy audit, 
(2)  To audits for which a notice of audit was given prior to the effective date of this Section, 
(3)  When a taxpayer refuses to promptly sign a waiver of Section 4-4-17 of this Code, or 
(4)  When a taxpayer fails to provide a timely and complete request for a coordinated audit as provided in subsection B1b of this Section. 
2.  Intercity Claims for Recovery. 
a.  Claims for Recovery. The intent of this Section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect, and remit sales and use taxes to the City. 
b.  As used herein, "claim for recovery" means a claim for reimbursement of sales and use taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction. 
c.  When it is determined by the City that sales and use tax owed to the City has been reported and paid to another municipality, the City shall promptly notify the vendor that the taxes are being improperly collected and remitted, and that as of the date of the notice the vendor must cease improper tax collections and remittances. 
d.  The City may make a written claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received tax and/or penalty and interest owed to the City or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision to make a claim for recovery lies in the sole discretion of the City. Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and/or vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve or deny in whole or in part, the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt. The municipality to which the City submits a claim for recovery may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of such extension by the City shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
e.  Within ninety (90) days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the City shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the claim is approved in whole or in part, the City shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality submitting the claim within thirty (30) days of approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for recovery may only be made for good cause. 
f.  The City may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same taxpayer. 
g.  The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be limited to the thirty-six (36) month period prior to the date the municipality that was wrongly paid the tax receives the claim for recovery. 
(Code 1985,  4-4-12; Ord. 00-7,  39) 
4-4-13: - Conduct of Hearings. 
A.  Subpoenas and Witness Fees. All subpoenas issued under the terms of this Chapter may be served by any person of full age. The fees of witnesses for attendance and trial shall be the same as the fees of witnesses before the District Court, such fees to be paid when the witness is excused from further attendance. When the witness is subpoenaed at the insistence of the City, such fees shall be paid in the same manner as other expenses under the terms of this Chapter, and when a witness is subpoenaed at the insistence of any party to any such proceeding, the City may require that the cost of service of the subpoena and the fee of the witness be borne by the party at whose insistence the witness is summoned. In such case the City, in its discretion, may require a deposit to cover the cost of such service and witness fee. A subpoena issued as aforesaid shall be served in the same manner as a subpoena issued out of a court of record. 
B.  Judge Compels Attendance. Any judge of the District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District of the State of Colorado, either in term time or vacation, upon the application of the City, may compel the attendance of witnesses, the production of books, papers, records or memoranda and the giving of testimony before the City or any of its duly authorized agents, by an attachment for contempt, or otherwise, in the same manner as production of evidence may be compelled before said Court. 
(Code 1985,  4-4-13; Ord. 00-7,  40) 
4-4-14: - Unpaid Tax a Prior Lien. 
A.  The taxes imposed by Section 4-4-5-1 shall constitute a first and prior lien upon any tangible personal property, real property and inventory owned or used which is the subject of any transaction upon which said tax is due, until said taxes are paid in full. 
B.  The taxes imposed by Section 4-4-4-2 shall be a first and prior lien upon the goods, business fixtures, inventory and real property owned or used by any retailer required by the provisions of Section 4-4-4-7 to submit a return and make payment of the taxes collected, until said taxes are paid in full. 
C.  The liens created by subsections A and B above shall be construed to be liens and encumbrances upon the specific items of personal property, goods, business fixtures, real property and inventory therein enumerated, and shall take precedence over all other liens, encumbrances or claims of whatsoever nature and shall immediately attach to such items without the necessity of the filing of any notice of lien thereof. 
(Code 1985,  4-4-14; Ord. 05-48,  6) 
4-4-15: - Enforcement of Taxes and Foreclosure of Liens. 
A.  If any taxes, penalty or interest imposed by this Chapter and shown due by returns filed by the taxpayer, or as shown by assessment duly made as provided herein, are not paid within fifteen (15) days after the same are due, the City shall issue a warrant under its official seal directed to any duly authorized revenue collector, or to the sheriff of any county in this State commanding him to levy upon, seize and sell sufficient personal property, real property and inventory of the tax debtor which is subject to the liens created by Section 4-4-14 found within his county for the payment of the amount due, together with interest, penalties and costs. 
B.  Simultaneously with the issuance of said warrant, the City shall issue a notice of tax lien, setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalties, interest and costs, the date of the accrual thereof, and that the City claims a first and prior lien therefor on the tangible personal property, real property and inventory of the taxpayer subject to said liens. 
C.  Such notice shall be on forms prepared by the City, shall be verified and shall be filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in this State in which the taxpayer owns tangible personal property, real property and inventory subject to said liens. 
D.  Upon the filing of said notice of lien, the effective date of said lien shall relate back to the date of the first taxable transaction for which any tax is due.

4-4-16: - Notices Sent by Mail. 
    Any notice required to be given to any taxpayer or the agent or personal representative of the estate of any taxpayer shall be sufficient if mailed, postpaid by first-class mail to the last-known address of the taxpayer or the agent or personal representative of the estate of the taxpayer. The first-class mailing of any notice under the provisions of Title 4 Municipal Finances and Taxation, Chapter 4 Sales and Use Tax, creates a presumption that such notice was received by the taxpayer or agent or personal representative of the estate of the taxpayer if the City maintains a record of the notice and maintains a certification that the notice was deposited in the United States mail by an employee of the City. Evidence of the record of the notice mailed to the last-known address of the taxpayer or agent or personal representative of the estate of the taxpayer as shown by the records of the City and a certification of mailing by first-class mail by a City employee is prima facie proof that the notice was received by the taxpayer or agent or personal representative of the estate of the taxpayer. 
(Code 1985,  4-4-16; Ord. 08-69,  1) 
4-4-17: - Limitations. 
A.

Nor shall any lien continue after such period, except for taxes assessed before the expiration of such period, notice of lien with respect to which has been filed prior to the expiration of such period; in which cases such lien shall continue only for one year after the filing of notice thereof. 
B.  In the case of a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax, the tax, together with interest and penalties thereon may be assessed, or proceedings for the collection of such taxes may be begun at any time. 
C.  Before the expiration of such period of limitation, the taxpayer and the City may agree in writing to an extension thereof, and the period so agreed on may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing.

B.  Disregard for Rules; Penalty Assessed: If any part of a deficiency in tax payment is due to negligence or intentional disregard of authorized rules and regulations with knowledge thereof, but without intent to defraud, there shall be added ten percent (10%) of the total amount of the deficiency; and in such case, interest shall be collected at the rate of one percent (1%) per month on the amount of the deficiency from the time the return was due, from the person required to file the return, which interest and addition shall become due and payable within fifteen (15) days after written notice and demand by the City. 
C.  Fraud; Penalty Assessed: If any part of the deficiency is due to fraud with the intent to evade the tax, then there shall be added fifty percent (50%) of the total amount of the deficiency, and in such case the whole amount of the tax unpaid, including the additions, shall become due and payable fifteen (15) days after written notice and demand by the City and an additional one percent (1%) per month on said amounts shall be added from the date the return was due until paid. 
D.  False Statements: It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully make, prepare or submit a tax return, or other document, containing any false statement, or to willfully make a false statement in any investigation or hearing, which may affect the tax liability of any person. 
E.  Annual Interest Rate; Deficiency Amounts: With respect to transactions consummated on or after January 1, 1986, that result in deficiency amounts as defined in this Section, the annual rate of interest shall be that established by the State Commissioner of Banking pursuant to Section 39-21-110.5, C.R.S.

    In addition to the penalties provided in Section 4-4-20 EMC, all officers of a corporation and all members of a partnership or a limited liability company required to collect, account for, and pay over any tax administered by this Article who willfully fail to collect, account for, or pay over such tax or who willfully attempt in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax, or the payment thereof, are subject to, in addition to other penalties provided by law, a penalty equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the total amount of the tax not collected, accounted for, paid over, or otherwise evaded. Officers of a corporation or members of a partnership or a limited liability company shall be deemed to be subject to this Section if the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company is subject to filing returns or paying taxes administered by this Article and if such officers of corporations or members of partnerships or limited liability companies voluntarily or at the direction of their superiors assume the duties or responsibilities of complying with the provisions of any tax administered by this Article on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company.

Removing such offenders from regular proximity to places where children are located and limiting the frequency of contact is likely to reduce the risk of an offense. 
B.  This Chapter is intended to serve the City's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the public health, safety and welfare by creating areas, around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers, where sexual predators and specified sexual offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

Chapter 6 - OFFENSES CODE 

7-6-1: - Liability for Conduct of Another, Complicity. 
    A person is legally liable as principal for the conduct of another constituting a criminal offense if, with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the offense, he aids, abets and advises the other person in planning or committing the offense. 
(Code 1985,  7-6-1) 
7-6-2: - Attempt. 
A.  Attempting to Commit a Crime. It shall be unlawful for a person to attempt to commit a crime. A person attempts to commit a crime if he: 
1.  When causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; or 
2.  Purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. 
B.  Conduct Held as a Substantial Step. Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subsection B1 of this Section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose. Without negating the sufficiency of other conduct, the following, if strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose, shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law: 
1.  Lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime; 
2.  Enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the place contemplated for its commission; 
3.  Reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime; 
4.  Entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it is contemplated that the crime will be committed; 
5.  Possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, which are specially designed for such unlawful use or which can serve no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances; 
6.  Possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, where such possession, collection or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the actor under the circumstances; 
7.  Soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime. 
C.  Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. When the actor's conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt under subsection A of this Section, it is an affirmative defense that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. The establishment of such defense does not, however, affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such abandonment or prevention. 
Within the meaning of this Code, renunciation of criminal purpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the actor's course of conduct, which increases the probability of detection or apprehension or which make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose. Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim. 
(Code 1985,  7-6-2) 
7-6-3: - Conspiracy. 
A.  Definition. It shall be unlawful for a person to conspire with another person or persons to commit a crime. A person conspires with another person or persons to commit a crime if he either expressly or impliedly agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an attempt to commit such crime. 
B.  Scope of Conspiratorial Relationship. If a person guilty of conspiracy, as defined by subsection A of this Section, knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, whether or not he knows their identity, to commit such crime. 
C.  Conspiracy with Multiple Criminal Objectives. If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship. 
D.  Overt Act. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired. 
E.  Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. It is a defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

Chapter 7 - CITY RIGHTS-OF-WAY-PERMITS AND REQUIREMENTS 

11-7-1: - Purpose and Objectives. 
A.  Purpose: 
    This Chapter provides principles, procedures and associated funding for the placement of structures and facilities, construction, excavation, encroachments and work activities within or upon any public right-of-way, and to protect the integrity of the road system and the City's infrastructure. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require permits of private users of the public rights-of-way, to establish permit procedures, and to fix and collect fees and charges. 
B.  Objectives: 
    Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for location of facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the City must insure that the primary purpose of the right-of-way, passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the value of other public and private installations, roadways, facilities, and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. The use of the right-of-way corridors by private users is secondary to these public objectives, and the movement of traffic. This Chapter is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of rights-of-way for location of facilities by public and private entities. It thus has several objectives: 
1.  To insure that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized. 
2.  To protect the City's infrastructure investment by establishing repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public rights-of-way, when work is accomplished. 
3.  To facilitate work within the rights-of-way through the standardization of regulations. 
4.  To maintain an efficient permit process. 
5.  To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the City. 
6.  To establish a public policy for enabling the City to discharge its public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition and technological development. 
7.  To promote cooperation among the permittees (as defined herein) and the City in the occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to; (i) eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly; (ii) lower the permittee's and the City's costs of providing services to the public; and (iii) minimize street cuts. 
8.  To assure that the City can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

11-7-15: - General Rights-of-Way Use and Construction. 
A.  Right-of-Way Meetings. Permittee will make reasonable efforts to attend and participate in meetings of the City, of which the permittee is made aware, regarding right-of-way issues that may impact its facilities, including, planning meetings to anticipate joint trenching and boring. Permittees and franchisees shall joint trench or share bores or cuts and coordinate construction whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable so as to reduce so far as possible the number of right-of-way cuts within the City and the amount of time that pedestrian and vehicular traffic is obstructed or impeded. 
B.  Minimal Interference. The City Manager or designee shall assign locations of facilities in the public right-of-way. Work in the right-of-way, on other public property, near public property, or on or near private property shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. Permittee's facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of the City, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the rights-of-way by, or under, the City's authority. Five feet (5') minimum horizontal clearance and eighteen inch (18") minimum vertical clearance shall be provided between facilities and water and sewer mains. If the minimum horizontal and vertical clearances are not adhered to then the permittee assumes all risk of damage and loss arising out of failure to comply with required clearances. The permittee's facilities shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere with new improvements the City may deem proper to make, or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the rights-of-way or other public property, and shall not unreasonably interfere with travel by the public and the use of public places during the construction, maintenance and repair, operation or removal thereof. 
C.  Underground Construction and Use of Poles. 
1.  Unless otherwise provided below, when required by general ordinances, resolutions, regulations or rules of the City or applicable State or federal law, permittee's facilities shall be placed underground at no cost to the City. Where all facilities are installed underground at the time of permittee's construction, or when all such facilities are subsequently placed underground, all permittee facilities shall also be placed underground at no expense to the City unless funding is generally available for such relocation to all users of the rights-of-way. Placing facilities underground does not preclude the use of ground-mounted appurtenances; however, related equipment, such as pedestals, must be placed in accordance with the City's applicable rules and code requirements. 
2.  In areas where existing facilities are aerial, the permittee may install aerial facilities. For above ground facilities, the permittee shall utilize existing poles wherever possible, although under no circumstances is the permittee allowed to attach facilities to ornamental poles. 
3.  Should the City desire to place its own facilities in trenches or bores opened by the permittee, the permittee shall cooperate with the City in any construction by the permittee that involves trenching or boring, provided that the City has first notified the permittee in some manner that it is interested in sharing the trenches or bores in the area where the permittee's construction is occurring. The permittee shall allow the City to place its facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, provided the City incurs any incremental increase in cost of the trenching and boring. Should the City desire to install ducts or conduit for the possible use of other entities, then the permittee shall allow the City to place these facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, provided the City shares proportionally in the cost of trenching and boring. The City shall be responsible for maintaining its respective facilities buried in the permittee's trenches and bores under this paragraph. 
D.  Use of Conduits by the City. The City may install or affix and maintain its own facilities for City purposes in or upon any and all of permittee's ducts, conduits or equipment in the rights-of-way and other public places, at a charge to be negotiated between the parties (but in no event greater than the best price charged by permittee to any other user), to the extent space therein or thereon is reasonably available, and pursuant to all applicable ordinances and Codes. For the purposes of this subsection, "City purposes" includes, but is not limited to, the use of the structures and installations for City fire, police, traffic, water, telephone, and/or signal systems. 
E.  Common Users. 
1.  The rights-of-way have a finite capacity for containing facilities. Therefore, whenever the City determines it is impracticable to permit construction of an underground conduit system by any other entity which may at the time have authority to construct or maintain conduits or ducts in the rights-of-way, but excluding entities providing services in competition with permittee, and unless otherwise prohibited by federal or State law or regulations, the City may require permittee to afford to such entity the right to use permittee's surplus ducts or conduits in common with permittee, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement for use of surplus ducts or conduits entered into by permittee and the other entity. Nothing herein shall require permittee to enter into an agreement with such entity if, in permittee's reasonable determination, such an agreement could compromise the integrity of the permittee's facilities. 
2.  Permittee shall give a common user pursuant to this Section a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days notice of its need to occupy a conduit and shall propose that the common user take the first feasible action as follows: 
(a)  Pay revised conduit rent designed to recover the cost of retrofitting the conduit with space-saving technology sufficient to meet permittee's space needs; 
(b)  Pay revised conduit rent based on the cost of new conduit constructed to meet permittee's space needs; 
(c)  Vacate the needed ducts or conduit; or 
(d)  Construct and maintain sufficient new conduit to meet permittee's space needs. 
3.  When two (2) or more common users occupy a Section of conduit facility, the last user to occupy the conduit facility shall be the first to vacate or construct new conduit. When conduit rent is revised because of retrofitting, space-saving technology or construction of new conduit, all common users shall bear the increased cost. 
4.  All facilities shall meet any applicable local, State, and federal clearance and other safety requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of contracts executed between permittee and the other common user. Permittee may, at its option, correct any attachment deficiencies and charge the common user for its costs. Each common user shall pay permittee for any fines, fees, damages or other costs the common user's attachments cause permittee to incur. 
(Ord. 00-85) 
11-7-16: - Coordination of Excavations: Joint Planning and Construction. 
A.  Reduction of Disruption and Interference. Excavations in City rights-of-way disrupt and interfere with the public use of City streets and damage the pavement and landscaping. The purpose of this Section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting better coordination among permittees making excavations in City rights-of-way and between these permittees and the City. Better coordination will assist in minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever feasible, and will ensure the excavations in City rights-of-way are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing of the streets by the City. 
B.  Excavation Master Plan. Any permittee owning, operating or installing facilities in City rights-of-way, providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video or other utility services, shall meet annually with the City Manager or designee, at the City Manager's or designee's request to discuss permittee's excavation master plan. At such meeting, to the extent not already in possession of the City, permittee shall submit documentation, in a form required by the City Manager or designee, showing a location of the permittee's existing facilities in the City rights-of-way. Permittee shall discuss with the City Manager or designee, its excavation master plan, and identify planned major excavation work in the City. The City Manager or designee may make his own record on a map, drawing or other documentation, of each permittee's planned major excavation work in the City; provided, however, that no such document prepared by the City Manager or designee shall identify a particular entity, or the planned major excavation work of that particular entity. Permittee shall meet with the City Manager or designee to discuss an initial excavation master plan no later than sixty (60) days after submitting its first permit application. Thereafter, each permittee shall submit annually, on the first regular business day of January, a revised and updated excavation master plan. As used in this subsection, the term "planned major excavation work" refers to any future excavations planned by the permittee when the excavation master plan or update is submitted that will affect any City right-of-way for more than five (5) days, provided that the permittee shall not be required to identify future major excavations planned to occur more than two (2) years after the date that the permittee's master plan or update is discussed. Between the annual meetings to discuss planned major excavation work, permittee shall use its best efforts to inform the City Manager or designee of any substantial changes in the planned major excavation work discussed at the annual meeting. 
C.  Repaving Plan. The City Manager or designee shall prepare a repaving plan showing the street resurfacing planned by the City. For purposes of this Section, the repaving plan shall include a landscaping or other right-of-way improvement plan. The repaving plan shall be revised and updated on an annual basis after meeting to discuss the permittee's and the City's master plans and updates. The City Manager or designee shall make the City's repaving plan available for public inspection. In addition, after determining the street resurfacing work that is proposed for each year, the City Manager or designee shall send a notice of the proposed work to all permittees that have had an annual meeting with the City Manager or designee. 
D.  Coordination with Repaving Plan. Prior to applying for a permit, any person planning to excavate in the City's rights-of-way shall review the City's repaving plan on file with the City Manager or designee and shall coordinate, to the extent practicable, with the utility and street work shown on such plans to minimize damage to, and avoid undue disruption and interference with the public use of such rights-of-way. 
E.  Locating Facilities. In performing locates of facilities in the public rights-of-way in preparation for construction under a permit, permittee shall compile all information obtained regarding its or any other facilities in the public rights-of-way related to a particular permit, and shall make that information available to the City in a written and verified format pursuant to written City policy. 
F.  Documentation of Location of Permittee's Facilities. Prior to undertaking any work in the rights-of-way the City may notify all permittees of the City work to be performed. Upon such notification, all permittees shall, within seven (7) days, locate their facilities in the rights-of-way in which the work will be performed, and provide documentation in a format pursuant to written City policy of the permittee's facilities in that right-of-way. If the permittee fails to provide the locate information requested by the City, the City may obtain this information and charge the permittee the actual costs for obtaining the information.

Water systems for fighting fire, derived from a supply that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use shall, whenever practicable, be kept wholly separate from drinking water pipelines and equipment. In cases where the domestic water system is used for both drinking and fire fighting purposes, approved backflow prevention devices shall be installed to protect such individual water lines used for potable water and not for fire fighting supply. It is hereby declared that it is the responsibility of the person or persons causing the introduction of said unapproved or unsafe water into the pipelines to see (1) that a procedure be developed and carried out to notify and protect users of this piping system during the emergency; (2) that special precautions be taken to disinfect thoroughly and flush out all pipelines which may have become contaminated before they are again used to furnish drinking water. 
The public water supply must be protected against backflow from dual domestic fire systems. 
L.  Violations and Penalties (Backflow and Cross-Connection). 
1.  The City will notify the owner, or authorized agent of the owner, of the building or premise in which there is found violations of these regulations. The City Manager or designee shall set a specific time for the owner to have the violation removed or corrected. If the owner fails to correct the violations in the specified time, the City Manager or designee may, if in his/her judgment an imminent health hazard exists, terminate the water service to the building or premise. Additional fines or penalties may also be assessed following termination of service. 
2.  All costs incurred by the City, State, contractor, or any authorized company, shall be at the owner's expense when a backflow or cross-connection involves contamination of any potable water system. 
3.  The owner or authorized agent of the owner responsible for the maintenance of the plumbing system in the building who knowingly permits a violation to remain uncorrected after the specified time set by the City, shall, upon conviction thereof by the court, be required to pay a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day or by imprisonment in jail for a period of time not to exceed one year for each day of violation or both such fine and imprisonment. 
M.  Severability. If any provision of this Section, or its application to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, and the remainder of this Section, shall not be affected thereby.

Determination of the needs and requirements of the City and its inhabitants with respect to water from its water system is a fact to be determined by the City in its own sound discretion to be exercised from time to time as the occasion may require. While it is the purpose of the City to maintain a water supply adequate to meet the needs of the approved areas dependent upon the City for a water supply, there are many elements which make it uncertain whether the supply can always be adequate for all, and therefore, in times of shortage, water service outside the City will be curtailed on the following basis, the first listed curtailment being adopted to meet the least serious situation and the succeeding curtailment being adopted in addition to prior listed curtailments, the last to meet the gravest possible situation and one which every reasonable precaution must be taken to avoid:

12-2-3: - Fees and Charges. 
A.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the payment of all POTW (publicly owned treatment works) costs, including costs of the City. The total annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to: labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory testing and a reasonable contingency fund. The charges will be based upon the quality and quantity of user's wastewater, and also upon the capital and operating costs to intercept, treat, and dispose of wastewater, and shall be established by formal action of the City Council. 
B.  General. There is hereby levied and charged on each lot, parcel of land and premises served by or having Wastewater connection with the Wastewater of the City or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the City Wastewater system an annual service charge which shall be computed and payable as follows: 
1.  The charge for wastewater treatment shall be based on the gallonage of water delivered to the premises during the lowest water meter reading period falling between September 1 through May 31 for service inside City and November 1 through April 30 for service outside City. This gallonage shall be converted to an annual equivalent and multiplied by the annual rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons provides the annual treatment charge. 
2.  A charge for Wastewater collection system maintenance shall be established annually by the City Council as part of their annual approval of the City's Fee and Rate schedule, or by separate resolution, where premises are served by the City collection system. Where the City does not own and maintain the collection system, the City will collect charges for maintenance of same only when authorized by the terms of contract between the City and the sanitation district. 
3.  Where water at any premises is taken through multiple meters, the charge for wastewater treatment shall be based on the gallonage of water delivered to the premises through all of the meters during the lowest water meter reading period falling between September 1 through May 31 for inside City and November 1 through April 30 for outside City, or the sum of the minimum charges for each meter, whichever is greater. However, one (1) bill for all wastewater treatment, composed of the sum of minimum charges for each meter used, or a single quantitative charge for all wastewater treatment may be issued in the following cases: 
a.  Where water service is taken through a combination of meters or through meters on two (2) or more service pipes, if water serviced through each of such meters and service pipes is delivered and used on the same property for one (1) general purpose, or the premises is a single enterprise on an integrated holding of land, undivided by public streets, roads or alleys; and 
b.  For each public school entity, even though the meters may be situated on separate properties. 
4.  Where water usage information is not available wastewater service charges will be based on a minimum charge established by ordinance and maintained in the City's Rate and Fee Schedule. 
5.  Outside City customers will be charged one hundred five percent (105%) of the amount charged inside City customers for similar service to compensate for additional infiltration from the longer interceptor lines. This factor shall be included in the flat rate and minimum rate tables establishing the rates charged to customers of the City. 
6.  Charges for service to customers inside the City limits shall be billed quarterly or annually in advance. Charges for Wastewater only service outside the City may, at the discretion of the City, be billed annually where this would not conflict with special provisions of a connector's agreement. All bills are due and payable as of the billing date and become delinquent thirty (30) days after the billing date for inside City and forty-five (45) days after the billing date for outside City. 
7.  User charges shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically to reflect actual treatment works O&M costs. 
8.  The rates charged by the City for all wastewater service shall be established by ordinance, and maintained in the City's Rate and Fee Schedule.

A school operating on a nine-month (9) school year, which supplies documentation to the City verifying the nine-month (9) schedule and which applies for a nine-month (9) operating status, shall be billed seventy-six percent (76%) of the charges which would normally accrue for similar usage by a residential customer. 
2.  Industries, car washes and other establishments where summer irrigation water is not significant or where seasonal business fluctuations are more significant than irrigation usage shall be billed based on annual rather than winter period water usage. 
3.  Customers with delivery flow characteristics significantly different from those of a single-family dwelling shall pay an additional readiness to serve fee as established by ordinance and maintained in the City's Rate and Fee Schedule. 
4.  Other Cases: Where the procedures above are not applicable, or when application of same would work an obvious and significant injustice to the customer, a rate shall be established by the City based on reasonable estimates of projected flow. 
D.  Permitted Industrial Users: 
1.  Industries that are permitted as Significant Industrial Users or have been issued a Wastewater Control Permit and discharge wastewater with BOD, COD and/or TSS in excess of Normal Domestic Strength Wastewater will be charged for the cost of handling treatment of these wastes calculated based upon the net excess loading. The use of surcharges does not permit the User to otherwise exceed any Local Limits specified, or Federal and State Pretreatment Standards. 
2.  The City shall require payment to cover the added cost surcharge of handling and treating the wastes as established by ordinance and maintained in the City's Rate and Fee Schedule. 
3.  Specific individual rates will be calculated based on the volume strength and rate of flow in accordance with current Federal guidelines. 
Adjustments to individual rates will be made annually or more frequently, whenever evidence is received that a major change in wastewater volume and/or characteristics has occurred. Payment will commence within one (1) year of the date of initiation of service through the POTW. 
4.  Industrial Users identified for inclusion into an applicable Sector Control Program may be charged for the costs incurred by the City for re-inspections due to failure to correct non-compliances or violations identified during a sector control inspection. A fee shall be established by Resolution of the City Council and maintained in the City's Rate and Fee Schedule, for each inspection required until completion of violation remedy.

If the bill is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing for inside City and forty-five (45) days after the billing date for outside City, it shall be deemed delinquent, whereupon a delinquency fee shall be imposed for collection services. The fee shall be established by ordinance and maintained in the City's Rate and Fee Schedule. 
2.  Non-payment. All wastewater charges and surcharges, including, but not limited to, collection charges, pretreatment charges, monitoring charges, shall be a lien upon the property to which wastewaters are connected from the date said charges become due until said charges are paid. The owner of every structure or premises shall be liable for all wastewater charges for users on his premises, which lien of liability may be enforced by the City by action at law to enforce the lien. In case the tenant in possession of any premises shall pay the wastewater charges, it shall relieve the landowner from such obligations and lien, but the City shall not be required to seek payment from any person whomsoever other than the owner of the property for the payment of wastewater charges. No change of ownership or occupation shall affect the application of this subsection, and the failure of any owner to discover that he purchased property against which a lien for wastewater service exists shall in no way affect his liability for such payment in full. Said delinquent payments, and the lien created thereby, shall be enforced by assessment upon the property and premises so served and certification thereof to the County Treasurer for the collection under and in pursuance as provided for in this Code. 
H.  Disconnection Clause: 
1.  The City may disconnect within the City or contract areas served by the City for accounts delinquent more than ninety (90) days. Notice shall be given to the last known address of user or owner thirty (30) days prior to disconnection.

12-2-5: - Industrial Pretreatment Program. 
A.  General Provisions: 
1.  Purpose and Objectives. It is necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City to regulate the collection of wastewater and treatment thereof to provide for maximum public benefit. This Chapter sets forth uniform requirements for non-domestic contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the City and enables it to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws. 
The objectives of the Industrial Pretreatment Program are: 
a.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly-Owned Treatment Works (POTW) that will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
b.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
c.  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system; 
d.  To provide for equitable distribution among users of the cost of the POTW; 
e.  To provide for and promote the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens residing within the City and connecting jurisdictions; 
f.  To enable the City to comply with its Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other Federal or State laws to which the POTW is subject; and 
g.  To prevent adverse impacts to worker health and safety due to the discharge of pollutants from industrial users. 
2.  Applicability. The provisions herein provide for the regulation of Indirect Discharge to the POTW through the issuance of permits, enforcement of applicable requirements, user reporting, the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs, and for other activities as defined in the Chapter. The provisions herein shall apply to users of the POTW and to persons outside the POTW who are, by contract or agreement with the POTW, users of the POTW. 
a.  Non-Domestic Users. It shall be unlawful for any User to discharge any domestic or non-domestic wastewater into any natural waterway, any surface drainage, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the City.

5.  State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than applicable Federal regulations or those established herein. 
6.  POTW's Right of Revision. The City can establish by ordinance more-stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in Section 12-2-5(A)(1) of this Chapter. 
B.  General Wastewater Prohibitions and Limitations: 
1.  General and Specific Prohibitions. A User may not introduce into a POTW any pollutant(s) which cause pass-through or interference. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions of this Section apply to each User introducing pollutants into a POTW whether or not the User is subject to other Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. It shall be unlawful for any User to discharge or deposit or cause or allow to be discharged or deposited into the wastewater treatment system of the City any wastewater which contains the following: 
a.  Any "hazardous waste" as defined in 40 CFR Part 261, unless specifically authorized by the POTW. 
b.  Any liquids, solids, or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on any explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system), be more than five percent (5%) nor any single reading over ten percent (10%) of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the meter. Fire or explosion hazard may also be determined using flash point concentration, by closed cup method as specified in 40 CFR Part 261.21. The flashpoint shall not be less than sixty degrees (60) Centigrade or one hundred forty degrees (140) Fahrenheit. 
c.  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the POTW.

z.  Any water or wastewater associated with hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and drilling activities, without prior written approval from the City. 
2.  Wastewater Discharge Limitations. The City is authorized to establish Local Limits pursuant 40 CFR Part 403.5(c). It shall be unlawful for any User to discharge, deposit, cause, or allow to be discharged any waste or wastewater which fails to comply with the limitations imposed by this Section. 
a.  Dilution is prohibited as a substitute for treatment and shall be a violation of this Chapter. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, no Industrial User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a Discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The City may impose mass limitations on Industrial Users which are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
b.  No Significant Industrial User shall discharge or cause to be discharged wastewater that exceeds the following Local Limits as specified in the Industrial Wastewater Permit using the methods and procedures prescribed in Subsection 12-2-5(G). 
Pollutant(1) Daily Maximum Limit (mg/L) Arsenic (As) 0.55 Cadmium (Cd) 0.30 Chromium-Total (Cr) 2.90 Chromium(VI) (Cr VI) 0.86 Copper (Cu) 3.94 Lead (Pb) 0.51 Mercury (Hg) 0.005 Molybdenum (Mo) 2.82 Nickel (Ni) 2.66 Selenium (Se) 0.054 Silver (Ag) 0.112 Zinc (Zn) 8.8 Benzene (2) 0.050 BTEX (2)(3) 0.750  
(1)  All pollutants are to be analyzed as total. 
(2)  These pollutants and limits generally apply to wastewaters from the cleanup of petroleum or gasoline underground storage tanks. In addition, the pollutants may be required of other users or included in permits where sampling and analysis indicate that the wastewater contains concentrations of these pollutants in excess of the stated limits. 
(3)  This is the sum of measured concentrations for Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene. 
c.  All Users subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard shall comply with all requirements of such standard, and shall also comply with any limitations contained in this Chapter. Where the same pollutant is limited by more than one (1) Pretreatment Standard, the limitations which are more stringent shall prevail. Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be the timeframe specified in the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard. 
d.  The City may establish more stringent pollutant limits, additional site-specific pollutant limits or additional Pretreatment Requirements when, in the judgment of the City, such limitations are necessary to implement the provisions of this Chapter. 
C.  Pretreatment and Monitoring Facilities: 
1.  Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this Chapter and shall achieve compliance with all Pretreatment Standards and Requirements set out in this Chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the City, whichever is more stringent. Any facility determined by the City to be necessary for compliance or monitoring shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the User's expense. All treatment facilities shall be properly operated and maintained. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be approved before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Chapter. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to and prior approval of the City. 
2.  The City may require Users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specified sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and demonstrate the User's compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. 
3.  The City may require any User discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An industrial wastewater permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
4.  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
5.  The City may require an Industrial User to install at the User's expense, suitable monitoring facilities or equipment that allows for the representative sampling and accurate observation of wastewater discharges. Such equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times. 
6.  The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the Industrial User's premises outside of the building unless otherwise approved by the City. When such a location would be impractical, the City may allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or easement area, with the approval of the agency having jurisdiction over such street or easement, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles. 
7.  When more than one User is able to discharge into a common service line, the City may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may require that separate service lines and connections and monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge. 
8.  Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications. 
9.  To fulfill the purposes of this Chapter, the City may order other Industrial Users of the City's POTW to maintain records and/or install and maintain similar facilities or equipment as described above. 
10.  Industrial Users who discharge process wastewaters determined by the City to contain pollutants necessitating continuous pH measurement to demonstrate compliance shall, subsequent to notification by the City, install a continuous recording pH meter as approved by the City. Such meter shall be installed, operated and maintained at the User's own cost and expense. Such records generated by this meter shall be retained for three (3) years and shall be made available to the City upon request. 
11.  If the City determines that an Industrial User needs to measure and report wastewater flow, the User shall install an approved flow meter. Such meter shall be installed, operated and maintained at the User's own cost and expense. Such records generated by this meter shall be retained for three (3) years and shall be made available to the City upon request. 
D.  Industrial Wastewater Permits: 
1.  Permits Required. All Significant Industrial Users proposing to connect to, or discharge into any part of the wastewater system, shall apply for and obtain an industrial wastewater permit prior to commencing discharge to the POTW. A separate permit may be required for each User, building or complex of buildings. The discharge of wastewater to the POTW without a valid permit from a Significant Industrial User shall be a violation of this Chapter as specified in Section 12-2-5(D)(2). Such Users shall immediately contact the City and obtain a permit for discharge. 
a.  Upon a finding that a Significant Industrial User subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards never discharges more than one hundred (100) gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in the Pretreatment Standards) the City may determine the Industrial User a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User rather than a Significant Industrial User if the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The Industrial User, prior to the City's finding, has consistently complied with all applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards and requirements; 
(2)  The Industrial User annually submits the certification statement required in 40 CFR Part 403.12(q) together with additional information necessary to support the certification statement; and 
(3)  The Industrial User never discharges any untreated concentrated wastewater. 
b.  Upon a finding that a Significant Industrial User not subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an Industrial User, determine that such Industrial User is not a Significant Industrial User. 
c.  By request from a Significant Industrial User and at the discretion of the City, a Non-discharging Industrial Wastewater Permit may be issued to the Significant Industrial User that requires specific controls and/or process configurations to prevent the discharge of wastewater from specific process operations, or of specific pollutants to the POTW. 
2.  Enforceability. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater permit, failure to apply for a permit as required, or discharging without a required permit shall be deemed a violation of this Chapter and subjects the Industrial User to the sanctions set out in Subsection 12-2-5(J). Obtaining an Industrial Wastewater Permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. 
3.  New Users: Applying for an Industrial Wastewater Permit. Any User required to obtain an Industrial Wastewater Permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must apply for and obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. The User shall file a Wastewater Discharge Application on forms provided by the City containing the information specified in Subsection 12-2-5(D)(5). The completed application for the Industrial Wastewater Permit must be filed at least ninety (90) days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. 
4.  Existing Users: Applying for Industrial Wastewater Permit Reissuance. A User with an expiring Industrial Wastewater Permit shall apply for a new permit by submitting a complete permit application at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the User's existing discharge permit. The User shall file a Wastewater Discharge Application on forms provided by the City containing the information specified in Subsection 12-2-5(D)(5). An Industrial User with an existing permit that has filed a complete and timely application may continue to discharge as approved by the City through an administrative extension of the existing permit.

E.  Reporting Requirements: 
1.  Periodic Compliance Reports - All Significant Industrial Users. 
a.  Except as specified in Section 12-2-5(E)(1)(f), any Industrial User subject to a Federal, State, or City Pretreatment Standard or Requirement must, at a frequency determined by the City submit no less than once per six (6) months, unless required more frequently in the permit or by the City, reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practices (BMPs) or pollution-prevention alternatives, the User must submit documentation required by the City or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine compliance status of the User. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with 12-2-5(E)(6)(a). 
b.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that the sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
c.  If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the City, using the methods and procedures prescribed in 12-2-5(G), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
d.  The sampling and analyses required for the reporting outlined above may be performed by the City in lieu of the permittee. Where the City itself makes arrangements with the User to collect all the information required for the report, the User will not be required to submit the report. 
e.  The City may authorize a Significant Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Significant Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Significant Industrial User. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(2)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than 5 years. The User must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each permit. 
(3)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the Industrial User must provide data from at least one (1) sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(4)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 12-2-5(E)(6)(a) of this Chapter. 
(5)  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(6)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the City must be included as a condition in the User's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the City for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver. 
(7)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's permit by the City, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement in Section 12-2-5(E)(6)(d), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User. 
(8)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User's operations, the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of Section 12-2-5(E)(1)(a), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the City, and notify the City. 
(9)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in Categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard. 
f.  The City may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports in Section E(1)(a) to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the EPA, where the Industrial User's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following: 
(1)  0.01 percent of the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or five thousand (5,000) gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the Industrial User discharges in batches. 
(2)  0.01 percent of the design dry-weather organic capacity of the POTW; and 
(3)  0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard for which approved wastewater discharge limits were developed in accordance with Section B(2)(b) of this Chapter. Reduced reporting is not available to Industrial Users that have in the last two (2) years been in Significant Noncompliance. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an Industrial User with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the City, decreasing the reporting requirement for this Industrial User would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
2.  Baseline Monitoring Reports - Categorical Industrial Users. 
a.  Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR Part 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing Industrial Users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the City a report which contains the information listed in paragraph b., below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, New Sources, and sources that become Categorical Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable Categorical Standard, shall submit to the City a report which contains the information listed in paragraph b., below. A New Source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards.

Written approval from the City must be obtained prior to installation of the interceptor. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Chapter. 
(c)  The design and sizing of sand/oil interceptors shall be in accordance with the POGS Sector Control Program policy and this Chapter. The sand/oil interceptor shall be designed, sized, installed, maintained and operated so as to accomplish their intended purpose of intercepting pollutants from the User's wastewater and preventing the discharge of such pollutants to the City's wastewater collection system. 
(d)  Upon change of ownership of any existing facility which would be required to have an interceptor under this Section, the applicant for sanitary sewer service shall have the burden to demonstrate that a properly sized and functioning sand/oil interceptor is installed. 
(e)  Toilets, urinals and similar fixtures shall not discharge waste through a sand/oil interceptor. Such fixtures shall be plumbed directly into the building sewer and waste system. 
(f)  The User shall ensure interceptors are easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of POGS. 
(g)  The User must maintain interceptors at their expense and keep in efficient operating condition at all times. 
(h)  Biological treatment or enzyme treatment shall not be a substitute for the servicing of sand/oil interceptors at the frequency determined by the City. Use of enzymes to emulsify petroleum oils and grease is prohibited. The direct addition of any enzyme, chemical or microbial agent to a sand/oil interceptor is prohibited. 
(2)  Required Maintenance. 
(a)  Sand/oil interceptors shall be maintained by regularly scheduled cleaning so that they will properly operate as intended to efficiently intercept the sand and oil from the facility's wastewater and prevent the discharge of said materials into the City's wastewater collection system. Maintenance frequency shall be in accordance with the POGS Sector Control Program policy. 
(b)  Maintenance of sand/oil interceptors shall be done in a workman-like manner only by a business/professional normally engaged in the servicing of such plumbing fixtures. 
(c)  In the event an interceptor is not properly maintained by the User, owner, lessee, or other authorized representative of the facility, the City may authorize such maintenance to be performed on behalf of the facility. The costs of such maintenance shall be billed directly to the customer and shall become part of the charges due and owing to the City and shall constitute a lien against the property until paid in full. 
(d)  The User must document each pump-out with a waste manifest or trip ticket which must remain on the premises or be made accessible for review by the City at any time for a minimum of three (3) years. 
(e)  The User must take reasonable steps to assure that all waste is properly disposed of at a facility in accordance with Federal, State and local regulations (i.e., through a certification by the hauler included on the waste manifest or trip ticket for each load). 
c.  Trucked and Hauled Septage. 
(1)  General Requirements. The requirements established in this Section shall apply to operators of companies subject to the Trucked and Hauled Septage Sector Control Program requirements established by the City. Users who dispose of trucked and hauled septage waste at the POTW's Septage Waste Receiving Facility (SWRF) shall obtain a permit to do so. 
(2)  General Control Requirements. 
(a)  All Users proposing to discharge trucked and hauled septage wastes shall apply for and obtain the required SWRF permit from the City. A User with an expiring SWRF permit shall apply for a new permit by submitting a complete permit application at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the User's existing SWRF permit. 
(b)  Septic waste fees and charges are specified in Section 12-2-4. 
(c)  All fees shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of a SWRF permit. 
(d)  SWRF permits are issued to the User for a specific operation. Permits cannot be reassigned, transferred, sublet or sold to a new User, different premises or a new or changed operation. 
(e)  SWRF permits may be modified, suspended or revoked in whole or in part with cause as determined by the City. 
(f)  The City shall establish standards and requirements that shall be met prior to and during the discharge of trucked and hauled septage wastes to the POTW. 
(g)  Any violation of the terms and conditions of an SWRF permit, failure to apply for an SWRF permit as required, or discharging without a required SWRF permit shall be deemed a violation of this Chapter and subjects the hauler to the sanctions set out in Subsection 12-2-5(J). Obtaining an SWRF permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. 
(h)  The City has the right to reject any waste which may be harmful to or cause obstruction of the wastewater collection system, or which may cause or contribute to interference or pass-through or violate any Local Limits adopted by the City. The discharge of industrial or commercial waste through the septage waste program is prohibited. 
J.  Compliance and Enforcement: 
1.  Enforcement Response Plan. The City may adopt policies and procedures as set forth in the City's Enforcement Response Plan for carrying out the provisions of this Chapter, provided that such policies and procedures are not in conflict with this Chapter or any applicable State or Federal law or regulation. 
2.  Publication of Users In Significant Non-Compliance. The City shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the Significant Industrial Users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in Significant Non-Compliance (12-2-1(D) with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. In addition, any User found to be in significant non-compliance with 12-2-1(D), Significant Non-Compliance, paragraphs (c), (d), or (h) shall also be published in the newspaper. 
3.  Administrative Enforcement Actions. 
a.  Verbal Notification. When the City finds a User has committed a minor isolated violation of a Sector Control Program, the City may notify the User informally through a phone call or in person. Verbal notifications related to enforcement or the investigation of suspected violations are documented in writing and placed in the respective Industrial User file. 
b.  Warning Letter. When the City finds a User has committed a minor isolated violation of any provision of this Chapter or an Industrial Wastewater Permit, the City may serve upon the User a written warning letter. Warning letters may be issued as follow-up correspondence to verbal notifications or in lieu of verbal notifications. 
c.  Notice of Non-Compliance. When the City finds a User has violated requirements of a Sector Control Program, the City may serve upon the User a written notice of non-compliance containing corrective actions and a schedule for completing the corrective action in accordance with the Sector Control Program Policy. 
d.  Notice of Violation (NOV). When the City finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Wastewater Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may serve upon the User a written notice of violation. Notice of Violations may include conditions and requirements to address the violation including an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction or prevention thereof. Within a time frame established by the City, a written plan to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the City. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the City to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
e.  Administrative Compliance Order. When the City finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Wastewater Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specific time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain administrative fines and/or other requirements to address the non-compliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
f.  Consent Orders. The City may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for non-compliance. Such documents shall include specific actions to be taken by the User to correct the non-compliance within a time period specified by the document. A consent order may include penalties, supplemental environmental projects, or other conditions and requirements as agreed to by the City and the User. 
g.  Show Cause Hearing. 
(1)  The City may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an industrial wastewater permit, an order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Water and Sewer Board and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the User as defined in 12-2-1(D). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(2)  The Water and Sewer Board may conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate a representative to: 
(a)  Issue in the name of the Water and Sewer Board notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in any such hearings; 
(b)  Take the evidence; 
(c)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing to the Water and Sewer Board, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations for action thereon. 
(3)  At any public hearing, testimony taken before the hearing authority or any person designated by it, shall be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript so recorded will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefore. 
(4)  Upon review of the evidence by the Water and Sewer Board, the Board shall make written findings of fact and conclusion upholding, modifying or striking the proposed enforcement action. 
h.  Administrative Fines. 
(1)  When the City finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an Industrial Wastewater Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may fine such User in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day, per violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  In determining the amount of administrative fine, the City shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the impact or threat to the POTW, worker and public health, or the environment as a result of the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the User's violation, compliance history and good faith actions by the User, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(3)  The City may seek compliance history from other local, State, or Federal sources as it relates to the provisions of this Chapter. 
(4)  The City preserves all rights under applicable law to file a claim in a Court of competent jurisdiction to recover liabilities in excess of the Administrative Fine threshold. 
(5)  A lien against the User's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(6)  Users desiring to appeal such fines must file a written request for the City to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the fine. Such notice or appeal shall set forth the nature of the order or determination being appealed, the date of such order or determination, the reason for the appeal, and request a hearing pursuant to procedures outlined in Subsection 12-2-5(J)(3)(g). 
(7)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
4.  Judicial Enforcement Remedies. 
a.  Injunctive Relief. When the City finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an industrial wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may petition the Englewood Municipal Court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the industrial wastewater permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Chapter on activities of the User. The City may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User. 
b.  Civil Penalties. 
(1)  A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an industrial wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day, per violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  The City may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the User's violation, corrective actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User. 
c.  Criminal Prosecution. A User who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Chapter or willfully, negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage or knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed or required to be maintained an industrial wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, shall upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day per violation and be subject to imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. 
d.  Remedies Non-Exclusive. The remedies provided for in this Chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies that the City may have under the provisions of Federal and State law. The City may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a non-compliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Enforcement Response Plan. However, the City may take other action against any User when the circumstances warrant and may take more than one (1) enforcement action against any non-compliant User. 
5.  Supplemental Enforcement Actions. 
a.  Performance Bonds. The City may decline to issue or reissue an industrial wastewater permit to any User who has failed to comply with any provision of this Chapter, a previous industrial wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless such User first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City of Englewood, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the City to be necessary to assure consistent compliance. 
b.  Liability Insurance. The City may decline to issue or reissue an industrial wastewater permit to any User who has failed to comply with any provision of the permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless the User first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
c.  Payment of Outstanding Fees and Penalties. The City may decline to issue or reissue an industrial wastewater permit to any User who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this Chapter, a previous industrial wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder. 
d.  Public Nuisances. A violation of any provision of this Chapter, an industrial wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the City. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Municipal Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. 
e.  Contractor Listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the City held by a User found to be in Significant Non-Compliance with Pretreatment Standards or Requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the City. 
6.  Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations. 
a.  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the User. An upset does not include non-compliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for non-compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) below, are met. 
(3)  A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(a)  An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(b)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(c)  The User has submitted the following information to the City within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days); 
(i)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-compliance; 
(ii)  The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to continue; and 
(iii)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the non-compliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have burden of proof. 
(5)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
b.  Prohibited Discharge Standards. A User shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for non-compliance with the general and specific prohibitions in 12-2-5(B)(1) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause interference or pass-through and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the interference or pass-through; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its CDPS permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements; or 
(3)  The User disclosed the pollutants causing the violation in the wastewater permit application. 
c.  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this Section, Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a User's treatment facility. Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4). 
(3)  Bypass Notifications. 
(a)  If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the City, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(b)  A User shall submit oral notice to the City of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The City may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the City may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless: 
(a)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(b)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(c)  The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (3). 
(5)  The City may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the City determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4). 
K.  Recovery of Costs: 
1.  It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the City's wastewater disposal system for the implementation of the program established herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by these Industrial Pretreatment Program Regulations and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the City. 
2.  The City may adopt charges and fees that may include: 
a.  Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the POTW's pretreatment program; 
b.  Fees for Industrial User identification, monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; 
c.  Fees for reviewing spill prevention and control procedures and construction; 
d.  Fees for permit issuance, including public notice costs; 
e.  Fees for filing appeals; 
f.  Fees for consistent removal of pollutants otherwise subject to Federal Pretreatment Standards; 
g.  Fees for the cost of publication in the newspaper for annual Significant Non-Compliance notifications; and 
h.  Other fees as the City may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
3.  Civil Fine Pass-Through. In the event that a User discharges such pollutants which cause the City to violate any condition of its CDPS permit and the City is fined by EPA or the State for such violation, then such User shall be fully liable for the total amount of the fine assessed against the City by EPA and/or the State. 
4.  Industrial Surcharge Cost Recovery. Industries that are permitted as Significant Industrial Users or have been issued a Wastewater Control Permit and discharge wastewater with BOD, COD and/or TSS in excess of Normal Domestic Strength Wastewater (Section 12-2-1(D)) will be charged for the cost of handling and treatment of these wastes as specified in Section 12-2-3(D)(2). The use of surcharges does not permit the User to otherwise exceed any prohibitions, Local Limits, or BMPs specified at Subsections 12-2-5 (B) and (I), or any Federal and State Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. 
(Code 1985,  12-2-5; Ord. 98-68; Ord. 00-7,  213; Ord. 09-6,  5; Ord. 48-17 ,  4) 
12-2-6: - Enforcement and Penalties. 
A.  Legal Action Authorized. If any User discharges into the POTW contrary to the provisions of this Chapter, or any order of the City, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief, including a petition in a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunction against the violation. For Industrial Users, specific enforcement authorities are specified at Chapter 12-2-11(I). 
B.  Termination of Service. The City may terminate or cause to be terminated wastewater treatment service to any user for a violation of any provisions herein. 
C.  Appeal Procedure and Order. Any permit applicant, permit holder, or other User affected by any decision, action, or determination, including cease and desist orders, made by the City other than any judicial action filed or under litigation in any court including the Englewood Municipal Court, or any permit issued hereunder, may file with the City a written request for reconsideration and a stay of the decision within ten (10) days of such decision, action, or determination, setting forth in detail the facts supporting the request, whereupon the City shall hold a hearing. The request for reconsideration shall be acted upon by the City within ten (10) days from the date of filing. The decision, action or determination may be stayed during such period of review by the City Manager or designee. 
If the decision of the City Manager or designee is unsatisfactory to the person appealing, they may file a written appeal to the water and sewer board within ten (10) days after receipt of the decision. The water and sewer board may hear the appeal and shall make a final ruling on the appeal within thirty five (35) days of receipt of the user's written appeal. The decision, action or determination of the City Manager or designee may be stayed during such period of review by the water and sewer board. After the water and sewer board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to cease and desist to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. The decision of the Water and Sewer Board shall be binding on all entities and the user until and unless ruled otherwise by an appropriate court.

    The Cable Operator should resolve citizen complaints without delay and interference from the Franchising Authority. 
    Where a given complaint is not addressed by the Cable Operator to the citizen's satisfaction, the Franchising Authority should intervene. In addition, where a pattern of unremedied complaints or noncompliance with the Standards is identified, the Franchising Authority should prescribe a cure and establish a reasonable deadline for implementation of the cure. If the noncompliance is not cured within established deadlines, monetary sanctions should be imposed to encourage compliance and deter future noncompliance. 
    These Standards are intended to be of general application, and are expected to be met under normal operating conditions; however, the Cable Operator shall be relieved of any obligations hereunder if it is unable to perform due to a region-wide natural emergency or in the event of force majeure affecting a significant portion of the franchise area. The Cable Operator is free to exceed these Standards to the benefit of its Customers and such shall be considered performance for the purposes of these Standards. 
    These Standards supercede any contradictory or inconsistent provision in federal, state or local law, provided, however, that any provision in federal, state or local law, or in any original franchise agreement or renewal agreement, that imposes a higher obligation or requirement than is imposed by these Standards, shall not be considered contradictory or inconsistent with these Standards.

A.  This Section is intended to strictly adhere to and implement existing case law and statutory law controlling in the State of Colorado as they relate to the doctrine of vested rights and equitable estoppel as applied to a home rule municipality exercising its authority and powers in code enforcement and related matters. It is the express intent of the City to require application of the provisions of this Chapter to as much property, developed or undeveloped, residential or business, occupied or vacant, in the City as is legally possible without violating the legally vested rights of an occupant, owner or developer under case law or statutory law. The criteria herein shall be considered in rendering a vested rights determination hereunder. It is intended that each case be decided on a case by case factual analysis. An applicant shall be entitled to a positive vested rights determination only if such applicant demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, entitlement to complete his or her development without due regard to the otherwise applicable provisions of this Chapter by reason of: 
1.  The provisions of Title 24, Article 68, C.R.S.; or 
2.  The existence of all three of the following requirements: 
a.  Some authorized act of the City; and 
b.  Reasonable good faith reliance upon such act by the applicant; and 
c.  Such a substantial change in position or expenditure by the applicant that it would be highly inequitable or unjust to destroy the rights acquired. 
B.  In evaluating whether an applicant (occupant, owner, developer or the successor in interest of the three) has met the requirements as set forth in (a) above, the Hearing Officer shall consider and give weight to the following factual matters: 
1.  The total investment made in the project/property, including all costs incurred subsequent to the act of the City relied upon by the applicant, which costs may include, without limitation, the costs of land acquisition, architectural and engineering fees and costs of on-site infrastructure improvements to service the project; 
2.  Any dedication of property made to public entities in accordance with the approved overall development plan for the project or the approved preliminary plan or plat for the project; 
3.  Whether infrastructure improvements which have been installed have been sized to accommodate uses approved in the approved overall development plan or the approved preliminary plan or plat for the project; 
4.  The acreage of the approved overall development plan or the approved preliminary plan or plat for the project and the number of phases within the overall development plan or the preliminary plat or plan and their respective acreage's which have received final approval; 
5.  Whether the completion of the project has been timely and diligently pursued; and

A.  This Section is intended to strictly adhere to and implement existing case law and statutory law controlling in the State of Colorado as they relate to the takings doctrine as applied to a home rule municipality exercising its authority and powers in code enforcement and related matters. It is the express intent of the City to require application of the provisions of this Chapter to as much property, developed or undeveloped, residential or business, occupied or vacant, in the City as is legally possible without violating takings law. 
B.  The criteria herein provided shall be considered in rendering a takings determination hereunder. It is intended that each case be decided on a case-by-case factual analysis. While the criteria for takings established in this section are intended to provide fair standards in a pre-litigation forum and to reflect the current state of the law for Colorado, the City's adoption or use of these criteria for takings shall not in any way be deemed an admission, concession or statement by the City that such criteria apply or are controlling in a court of law, and the City hereby unconditionally reserves all defenses and claims which would otherwise be available to it under the law. For example, but without limitation, the City does not concede for litigation purposes that the "reasonable nexus"/"rough proportionality" doctrines apply to monetary exchanges or to legislative acts, although the City chooses to apply such criteria to the takings determination process described herein.

Where a district boundary line is shown as adjoining a railroad right-of-way, said line shall be deemed to coincide with the boundary line of such railroad right-of-way. 
b.  If a district boundary line extends in the direction of the length of a block, the district boundary line shall be deemed to coincide with the centerline of such block. 
c.  If a district boundary line is shown as approximately following platted lot lines, said boundary line shall be deemed to coincide with such platted lot lines. 
d.  If a district boundary line divides a platted lot or crosses unsubdivided property, the location of the district boundary line shall be determined by dimensions shown upon the zoning map.

h.  In the event a dedicated street or alley shown on the map is vacated by ordinance, the property formerly in said street or alley shall be included within the zone of the adjoining property on either side of said vacated street or alley. In the event said street or alley was a zone boundary between two (2) or more different zones, the new zone boundary shall be the former centerline of said vacated street or alley. 
2.  Exception. The regulations herein established shall apply uniformly to all geographical areas having the same district classification and bearing the same designation on the official map; provided, however, that if a district boundary line established by this Title, or by an amendment hereto, divides an area of land held in one ownership of record on the date the district boundary line was established, then and in that event:

b.  Land Under One Ownership Having More Than Eighteen Thousand Square Feet. Any parcel of land containing more than eighteen thousand (18,000) square feet, shall be used only in conformance with and subject to the regulations herein established for the zone districts in which each portion of the parcel falls. 
c.  Medical Zone Districts. In cases where an assemblage of property under one (1) ownership is split by a zoning boundary dividing the M-1 and M-2 zone districts, the entire property shall be developed according to the requirements for the M-2 zone district, with the exception that the first floor retail portion of the structure shall be confined to the original M-2 zoned portion of the property. 
d.  M-O-2 Medical Overlay District. Properties located within the M-O-2 Medical Overlay District are required to develop under all R-2-B base zone district regulations, unless the property is developed as part of a larger development including adjacent property zoned M-2 fronting on Hampden Avenue. In such a case, the entire property shall be developed according to the requirements for the M-2 zone district, with the exception that the first floor retail portion of the structure shall be confined to the original M-2 zoned portion of the property.

16-2-3: - Development Application Procedures. 
    Prior to any change in use and/or development activity on any real property within the City of Englewood, a permit must be obtained from the City for such action according to Chapter 16-2 EMC. The appropriate type of permit will be decided upon the filing of an application, and may be subject to an application processing fee. 
A.  Authority to File Applications. An application for review or approval under this Title shall be filed by a person having legal authority to take action in accordance with the approval sought. Those persons include: 
1.  The record owner of the property, and 
2.  A purchaser under a sale authorized in writing to do so, 
3.  An agent of the record owner authorized in writing to do so, or 
4.  Any other party specifically identified as being eligible to file a particular type of application in this Title. 
The Council or Commission may also initiate amendments to the text of this Title or to the Official Zoning Map with or without an application from affected property owners. 
B.  Application Form with Required Submittal Materials. Applications required under this Title shall be submitted on forms provided by the City in such numbers as required by the City, and shall be accompanied by such submittal documents as required by each type of permit requested, in addition to any other requirements the City Manager or designee may from time to time designate through administrative action. 
C.  Processing and Other Applicable Fees. 
1.  Fee Schedule. Each applicant for a development review or approval, or the issuance of a permit under this Title, or for review and approval of a subdivision, or for a Zoning Variance or appeal to the Board, shall pay fees as determined by Council by resolution to partially or wholly defray the expenses attendant upon the City's consideration of the application. A schedule of fees is on file with the City. Fees shall not be required with applications initiated by the Council, Commission, or City departments. All fees shall be non-refundable, unless otherwise expressly stated in writing at the time of acceptance by the City. 
In the case of telecommunications license fees, the schedule of fees may provide for a reduction or waiver of fees in the case of: 
a.  Construction of new towers with excess capacity, where the applicant commits in advance to allow co-location; 
b.  Co-location of antennae on existing towers and/or alternative tower structures; 
c.  Location of antennas on existing alternative tower structures; 
d.  Other conditions that the City believes will minimize the need for construction of new towers. 
2.  Judicial Review. Any person applying to the courts for a review of any final and reviewable decision made under this Title by the Council, Commission or Board, shall pay the cost of preparing any necessary transcript and any necessary record of proceedings. 
3.  Cost Recovery Fees for City Acquired Rights-of-Way. Where it is necessary to acquire right-of-way for City purposes associated with streets and utilities through purchase or eminent domain, the City may recover the cost thereof by a development fee applied to property adjoining the acquisition area and from which parcel the right-of-way was originally acquired (hereinafter "benefited property"). The development fee shall equal an amount based on an individualized determination of the extent of impact the benefited property has on such right-of-way or the extent of benefit the benefited property extracts from the acquired right-of-way. In no case shall the amount of the development fee exceed the cost of acquisition. The development fee shall be applied at the time the benefited property is subdivided or developed, and shall be paid at the time of development or construction by the owner of the property. No fee shall be imposed for right-of-way dedicated at no cost to the City. 
4.  Recording Fees. The expenses of recording documents required by this Title to be recorded with the Arapahoe County Clerk and Recorder shall be borne by the applicant and shall be paid prior to the recording. 
D.  Development Review Team. The Development Review Team (DRT) shall consist of representatives from City departments as requested by the applicant or required by the City Manager. The DRT performs both a pre-application and post-application review role: the Development Review Team functions as an ad hoc pre-application review body and will conduct a pre-application conference as needed. In addition, the DRT is responsible for referrals of submitted applications, as appropriate, to government agencies, utilities, neighborhood organizations, and other interested or affected persons or organizations. The DRT provides responses to the proposed application and those comments are forwarded to the applicant for consideration in a final application. 
E.  Application Completeness. The applicant shall prepare an application and submit it to the City to determine its completeness, as described below: 
1.  The City shall only initiate the review and processing of an application if such application is complete. Only complete applications, as set forth in this Title, shall be considered an "application" for purposes of compliance with C.R.S. 24.68-101 et. seq., as amended. 
2.  An application shall be considered complete if it is submitted in the required form, includes all submittal information, including all items or exhibits specified by the City Manager or designee during the pre-application conference, and is accompanied by the applicable processing fee. 
3.  The City shall review an application for completeness within ten (10) days of its filing. If the City determines that the application is complete, the application shall then be processed pursuant to this Title. If the City determines that the application is incomplete, the City shall notify the applicant of that fact and specify the specific ways in which the application is deficient. No further processing of the incomplete application shall occur until the deficiencies are corrected. If the applicant does not correct the deficiencies within thirty (30) days after the date shown on the notice from the City, the application shall be considered withdrawn. Any re-submittal of the application by the applicant will be treated as a new application. 
F.  Pre-Application Conferences. 
1.  Prior to filing an application to annex any parcel of land to the City, or rezone any parcel of land (including PUD rezoning), the applicant shall participate in a pre-application review with the Development Review Team. No additional application for these types of approvals shall be accepted until after the pre-application review is completed and the applicant receives written notification of the DRT's conclusions. This review should take place prior to any substantial investment, such as land acquisition for a proposed development, site and engineering design, or the preparation of other data. At or prior to this review, the applicant shall submit those materials included in the City's list of submission items, and it is the applicant's responsibility to provide sufficiently detailed plans and descriptions of the proposal to enable staff to make the determinations required below. 
2.  In addition to a pre-application review with the DRT, the City Manager or designee may review the application to determine if public improvements may be necessitated as a result of the proposed action. The City Manager or designee may require public improvements after making a determination of need based on the consideration of the following items: 
a.  The extent of existing and contemplated development of the property. 
b.  The need to ensure that the health, safety, and welfare of the public will be maintained. 
c.  Whether the proposed action may ultimately create a need for public improvements to serve the area. 
d.  The need to ensure that any required public improvements are roughly proportional to the additional burdens that proposed action will place on existing public improvements or services. 
3.  If public improvements are necessary, standards, criteria, timing and extent of public improvements as specified by the Department of Public Works shall apply, except that all rights-of-way, easements, and access rights shall be required at the time of zoning or rezoning and other public improvements shall be constructed at a time designated by the City Manager or designee, unless otherwise required by law. 
4.  Within ten (10) days after the date of the pre-application review, the DRT shall notify the applicant in writing of its informal recommendation regarding the desired development activity with respect to the following items: 
a.  Applicability of City policies, plans, and requirements as they apply to the proposed development. 
b.  Appropriateness of the development with respect to the policies set forth in the Comprehensive Plan and the regulations in this Title. 
c.  Need, if any, to prepare a subdivision plat. 
d.  Any site plan considerations or requirements. 
e.  Any concerns or requirements related to the anticipated impact upon public rights-of-way and public improvements and appropriate requirements to mitigate those impacts. 
f.  Any concerns related to land use, landscaping concepts, and overall project design. 
g.  Possible alternatives or modifications related to the proposed application. 
h.  Procedures that will need to be completed to review and approve the proposed change. 
5.  The informal recommendations of the DRT are not binding upon the applicant or the City, but are intended to serve as a guide to the applicant in making the application and advising the applicant in advance of the formal application of any issues which will or may subsequently be presented to the Commission and Council. 
G.  Notice Requirements. 
1.  Published Notice. Notice shall be by one (1) publication on the City's official website or in the newspaper designated by City Council as the City's official newspaper at least ten (10) days before any hearing before the Council, the Commission, or the Board. The City shall be responsible for all required published notices, and for providing evidence of timely published notice at the time of the hearing or consideration. 
2.  Posted Notice. The property shall be advertised by posting for not less than ten (10) consecutive days prior to a hearing before the Council, the Commission, or the Board; provided, however, that where the case does not involve a specific property, no posted notice shall be required. A posted notice shall consist of a sign not less than twenty-two inches (22") by twenty-eight inches (28") in size, located not less than four feet (4') above ground level in a conspicuous place, with letters not less than one inch (1") in height in black paint, which letters can be read from the adjoining street right-of-way.

1.  Hearings Required. A public hearing shall be required for those types of applications for which a decision is to be made by the Commission, the Board, or the Council. 
2.  Representation at Any Hearing. At any hearing, any party-in-interest may appear in person, or may be represented by a duly authorized person, or by an attorney. 
3.  Scheduling a Hearing. Following the acceptance of a completed application, the City shall set a tentative date for a public hearing before the first body required to hold a hearing on the matter. The tentative hearing date may be changed by the City Manager or designee at any time prior to the publication or posting of notices if the City Manager or designee determines that more time is needed for a more thorough review of the application, but no such change shall result in the delay of the tentative hearing date by more than thirty (30) days. 
4.  Conduct of Public Hearings. 
a.  During the public hearing, the review- or decision-making body shall hear any relevant evidence or statement provided by the applicant or its representative, by the City Manager or designee or any member of the staff, and by any person in attendance at the hearing. The review- or decision-making body may, in its sole discretion, hear and consider any other relevant statement or evidence, written or oral. 
b.  The review or decision-making body shall cause its public hearing to be recorded. When a transcript of a public hearing is required, the person or entity requesting the transcription shall pay the cost of the transcript. If the Council acquires a copy of the transcription of the proceedings, its copy of the transcription shall be made available to any person at reasonable times for inspection and study. A written summary of the relevant testimony and evidence presented at the review- or decision-making body hearing may be utilized in place of the transcript if a transcript is not required. 
c.  Within thirty-five (35) days after the hearing, the review- or decision-making body shall adopt written findings of fact, and shall make a recommendation or take action on the application. Before adoption of the findings of fact, members of the review- or decision-making body may elaborate on their reason for the vote. The written findings and recommendations shall include a statement of the body's findings and conclusions upon all relevant issues of fact or law raised by the application, and a recommendation or decision for approval or denial thereof. A copy of the written findings of fact and recommendation shall be mailed to the applicant and to any other person who requested a copy thereof. 
5.  Continuing a Hearing. Once a hearing before the Council, Commission, or Board has commenced, it may be continued to a later date for purposes of accepting additional testimony, or for preparation or submission of additional requested materials, or at the request of the applicant. A hearing for which proper notice was given may be continued to a later date without again complying with the notice requirements of this Chapter, provided that the continued hearing is set for a date certain and the date and time of the continued hearing is announced at the time of continuance. 
I.  Limitations on Conditions of Approval. The decision-making body shall be authorized to impose such conditions upon any site-specific development application as may be necessary to carry out the general purpose and intent of this Title or the Comprehensive Plan, provided that any requirements for the payment of money, the dedication of land, or the provision of services attached to a specific development application on a discretionary (non-formula) basis may only be imposed following an individualized determination that such requirements are directly related to the anticipated impacts of the proposed development and are roughly proportional in both extent and amount to the anticipated impacts of the proposed development. 
J.  Simultaneous Processing of Development Applications. 
1.  At the applicant's request and with the City's approval, applications for different types of reviews and approvals may be processed simultaneously to shorten the total review and processing time for a proposed development. 
2.  When a final plat is submitted for simultaneous review with the preliminary plat, both shall be reviewed according to the preliminary plat approval process as outlined in this Chapter. Unless simultaneous review is approved, the City shall not accept applications for final plat approval before preliminary plat application approval. 
3.  The expected time frame and approval process for a consolidated application shall follow the longest time frame and approval process required from among the joined application types. 
K.  Times for City Review. Maximum times for City review are recommended in various subsections of this Chapter. All times for review stated in this Chapter are estimated and advisory only. Unless otherwise expressly allowed, failure to keep within the recommended time for review shall not be deemed an approval or recommendation of approval on behalf of the review body, decision-making body, or appeal body. 
L.  Lapse of Approval. 
1.  Lapse of Approval-General. Many City decisions to approve applications covered by this Title are based on an expectation that the applicant intends to proceed with the proposed action as described within a reasonable amount of time, and many approvals are therefore time-limited. The table in Section 16-2-2 EMC above summarizes those lapsing time frames or periods. City approvals of these types must be followed by action by the applicant to develop or alter the property as described in the approved application before the end of the lapsing period-or the approval shall be of no further force and effect. 
2.  Extension of Approval Periods. An applicant may request, and the decision-making body that granted the original approval may grant one (1) extension of the approval for a period equal to the original lapsing period. Extension requests shall be evaluated on the basis of compliance with regulations and policies in effect at the time of the extension request, and will be allowed only when the following conditions exist: 
a.  The provisions of this Title or this Chapter must not expressly prohibit the extension; and 
b.  The extension request must be filed in a form established by the City and include all exhibits and fees; and 
c.  The applicant evidences that the delay in taking action under the approval was caused by circumstances beyond the applicant's control. 
An appeal from a determination to extend an approval time frame shall be made to the appeal body who would have heard an appeal of the original approval. 
3.  Termination of Postponed Application. Any application made pursuant to this Title which has been postponed or continued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days shall lapse.

1.  It corrects an error in the current Comprehensive Plan; 
2.  Events, trends, or facts evident after adoption of the current Comprehensive Plan have changed the Council's original findings made upon plan adoption; or 
3.  Events, trends, or facts evident after adoption of the Comprehensive Plan have changed the character or condition of the community so as to make the proposed amendment necessary to promote the public health, safety, or welfare of the community. 
G.  After Approval. An approved amendment to the Comprehensive Plan shall not lapse, but shall remain in effect until superseded by a later or inconsistent amendment to, or replacement of, the Comprehensive Plan. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-2-5: - Annexation Petitions. 
A.  Statutory Procedures.

4.  The procedure for the initial zoning of property annexed or to be annexed to the City shall follow, to the extent practicable, the rezoning provisions of Section 16-2-7 EMC. 
5.  The zoning procedures may be initiated at any time after the City commences annexation pursuant to C.R.S. Sections 31-12-101 et. seq., as amended, but must be completed no later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the annexation ordinance. 
6.  No ordinance initially zoning property annexed to the City shall be adopted on second reading prior to the date the annexation ordinance is adopted on second reading. 
C.  Criteria. All annexations shall be reviewed for compliance with the following criteria. However, annexation is a discretionary, legislative act. The City shall never be compelled to annex, unless otherwise required by State law, even if all these review criteria have been satisfied.

6.  The concept plan, as applicable, shows the following: 
a.  Appropriate land use, utility, and transportation design, given the existing and planned capacities of those systems; and 
b.  Mitigation of potential adverse impacts on adjacent properties and neighborhoods. 
7.  The annexation boundaries are configured such that: 
a.  The property can be efficiently served by utilities, facilities, and services; and 
b.  The annexation will not limit the ability to integrate surrounding land into the City or cause variances or exceptions to be granted if the adjacent land is annexed or developed. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-2-6: - Amendments to the Text of Title 16 (UDC). 
    Whenever the public necessity, convenience, health, safety, general welfare, or appropriate zoning practice justifies an amendment to any section of this Title, and after the amendment has been submitted at a public hearing for consideration and recommendation by the Commission, the Council may, after a public hearing on the proposed text amendment, change the text of this Title. 
A.  Initiation. A proposed amendment to any section of this Title may be initiated by any party identified in Section 16-2-3.A EMC. 
B.  Notice. The City shall require that published notice of required public hearings be given in accordance with Section 16-2-3.G EMC.

1.  It corrects an error in the current text of this Title, and correction of such error will be consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan; 
2.  Events, trends, or facts evident after adoption of the text of this Title have changed the character or condition of the community so as to make the proposed amendment inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and the amendment is necessary to promote the public health, safety, or welfare of the community. 
G.  After Approval. An approved amendment to text of this Title shall not lapse, but shall remain in effect until superseded by a later or inconsistent amendment to, or replacement of, the text of this Title. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-2-7: - Official Zoning Map Amendments (Rezonings). 
    The City may initially zone annexed property, or the boundaries or areas of any zone district may be changed, or the zone classification of any parcel of land may be changed pursuant to this Section. Rezonings shall not be used as a way to legitimize nonconforming uses or structures, and should not be used when a conditional use, Zoning Variance, or Administrative Adjustment could be used to achieve the same result. Rezonings to a Planned Unit Development district (PUD) shall follow the procedures and criteria as set forth in Section 16-2-8 for Planned Unit Developments. 
A.  Initiation. 
1.  A proposed rezoning may be initiated by any party identified in Section 16-2-3.A EMC. 
2.  A rezoning application shall expire one (1) year after submittal unless a public hearing on the application has been held by the Council on or before that date; provided, however, that the City Manager or designee may extend the application for six (6) months if the reason for the delay was due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. 
B.  Thresholds for Rezoning. 
1.  Thresholds for Base District Rezonings: 
a.  General. A base district rezoning results in the change of a property's existing base zoning district classification to a base zoning district classification identified in Table 16-3-1.1, other than a PUD or TSA district. 
b.  Minimum District Size. A base district rezoning application shall only be considered for properties greater than thirty-seven thousand five hundred (37,500) square feet of land area and contiguous to a compatible zone district. 
c.  For purposes of this Section, "compatible zone districts" are districts within the same base zoning district headings as identified in Table 16-3-1.1 (i.e. R-2-A and R-2-B are compatible zone districts within residential headings.) The contiguity to compatible zone district requirement does not apply if the rezoning request is consistent with and implements the Comprehensive Plan. 
2.  Thresholds for Transit Station Area (TSA) Rezonings: 
a.  District Location. The location of a Transit Station Area (TSA) district shall be consistent with the following criteria: 
(1)  The location of the proposed TSA district shall be consistent with the locations described or depicted for transit-related and/or mixed-use development in the Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  The TSA district shall be located generally within a one-quarter (1/4) mile radius of an existing, or a planned and approved light-rail rapid transit station. 
(3)  The one-quarter (1/4) mile radius may be augmented by an extended area which would include up to a one-half (1/2) mile radius where the area is contiguous to the TSA district and that it can be demonstrated that the area creates a transitional zone when the Planning and Zoning Commission makes a finding that such an extension is a benefit to the adjoining zone districts. 
b.  Minimum District Size. 
(1)  An application to rezone to a TSA district shall include a minimum gross land area of three (3) acres. 
(2)  The City may allow smaller incremental and contiguous additions to an existing TSA district, if the subsequent rezoning application: 
(a)  Includes a minimum gross land area of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet; 
(b)  Is consistent with the intent of the TSA district; 
(c)  Provides uses or a mix of uses complementary to the mix of uses planned or developed in the adjoining, existing TSA district; and 
(d)  Demonstrates site and building designs that will be compatible with, and integrated with, the adjoining, existing TSA district. 
C.  Pre-Application Review and Neighborhood Meeting. 
1.  Pre-Application Conference. All applicants for rezoning shall be required to participate in a pre-application conference pursuant to Section 16-2-3.F EMC. 
2.  Pre-Application Neighborhood Meeting. Following the pre-application conference, each applicant for a rezoning shall hold a neighborhood meeting in accordance with City procedures to describe their proposal before an application for rezoning can be accepted by the City. The neighborhood meeting is an opportunity for the applicant to describe the proposal as well as for area residents and property owners to offer input about the proposal at an early stage. The applicant shall hold the meeting at a time and location accessible and convenient for the public. The City shall be represented at the meeting. Following the neighborhood meeting the City representative may prepare a written report summarizing the general discussion of the neighborhood meeting and make copies available to the City staff, the applicant, and the public. 
3.  The maximum time between a required neighborhood meeting and a public hearing before the Commission shall not be more than one hundred eighty (180) days. In the event the public hearing is not held within one hundred eighty (180) days, the applicant shall be required to hold another neighborhood meeting. 

D.  Notice. The City Manager or designee shall require that notice of required public hearings be given in accordance with Section 16-2-3.G EMC. 
E.  City Review. The City Manager or designee shall review the proposed rezoning, and may refer the application to any City department or agency (including any utility providers, other municipalities or other agency as determined by the City) for its review and comments, and shall prepare a report of its recommendations for review by the Commission and Council. A copy of the report shall be furnished to the applicant. 
F.  Commission Review and Recommendation. 
1.  The Commission shall review the proposed rezoning and the recommendation of City staff, and shall hold a public hearing on the proposed rezoning. Following such hearing, the Commission may make a recommendation to approve, deny, or modify the proposed rezoning. 
2.  The Commission may recommend to the Council that an application for an initial zoning or a rezoning be approved upon condition that the applicant, or the applicant's successors and assigns, obtain approval by the Commission and Council of a site plan or subdivision plat of the subject property either prior to Council action, within a certain time after Council action, or prior to any site development. 
3.  In its review of the rezoning application, in addition to any other criteria and findings applicable to the decision, the Commission's recommendations shall include its written findings on each of the following points: 
a.  The application is or is not consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and this Title; and 
b.  The application is or is not in conformance with adopted and generally accepted development standards in the City, and any other ordinance, law, or requirement of the City; and 
c.  The application is or is not substantially consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies, of the City. 
G.  Council Action. 
1.  The Council shall review the proposed rezoning, the recommendation of City staff, and the recommendation of the Commission, and shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment. Following such hearing, the Council may approve, deny, or refer a proposed amendment back to the Commission. 
2.  Refer Back to Commission. No substantial amendment to an application for a rezoning may be made by the Council after a recommendation on the rezoning has been made by the Commission, unless it is first referred back to the Commission for comment on the proposed substantial amendment. 
H.  Criteria. Rezonings shall be made in the interest of promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, and shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, the review- or decision-making body shall only recommend approval of, or shall only approve, a proposed rezoning, if it finds that the proposed rezoning meets the criteria listed below. 
1.  For base district rezonings, the proposed rezoning shall meet at least one of the following criteria: 
a.  That there has been a material change in the character of the neighborhood or in the City generally, such that the proposed rezoning would be in the public interest and consistent with the change; or 
b.  That the property to be rezoned was previously zoned in error; or 
c.  That the property cannot be developed, or that no reasonable economic use of the property can be achieved, under the existing zoning. 
The criteria in subsections 1.a through c above shall not apply to the initial zoning of property annexed to the City or to rezonings that may occur incidental to a comprehensive City-initiated revision of the City's Official Zoning Map. 
2.  For TSA rezonings, the proposed development shall comply with all applicable use, and development standards set forth in this Title that are not otherwise modified or waived according to the rezoning approval; and the proposed rezoning shall meet at least one of the following criteria: 
a.  The proposed development will exceed the development quality standards, levels of public amenities, or levels of design innovation otherwise applicable under this Title, and would not be allowed or practicable under a standard zone district with conditional uses or with a reasonable number of Zoning Variances or Administrative Adjustments; or 
b.  The property cannot be developed, or no reasonable economic use of the property can be achieved, under the existing zoning, even through the use of conditional uses or a reasonable number of Zoning Variances or Administrative Adjustments. 
3.  All rezonings shall meet the following criterion: 
a.  The resulting rezoned property will not have a significant negative impact on those properties surrounding the rezoned area and that the general public health, safety and welfare of the community are protected. 
I.  After Approval-Lapsing Period. 
1.  An approved rezoning shall not lapse, but shall remain in effect until and unless superseded by a later or inconsistent amendment to, or replacement of, the Official Zoning Map. 
2.  TSA rezoning. An approved TSA district rezoning shall not lapse, but shall remain in effect until superseded by a later or inconsistent amendment to, or replacement of, the TSA District Official Zoning Map. 
(Ord. 04-5; Ord. 08-48,  3; Ord. No. 11-52,  3; Ord. 29-14,  3, 4; Ord. 2-15,  1) 
16-2-8: - Planned Unit Development (PUD) Rezoning Process and Requirements. 
A.  Intent . The PUD Zone District is an alternative to conventional land use regulations resulting in the creation of a unique zone district that offers the City and Applicant forms or qualities of development or amenities not allowed through existing base zone districts. The PUD Zone District combines use, density, height, design and site plan considerations into a unified process. Each PUD Zone District must include its own list of permitted and conditional uses and shall identify what development standards will apply. 
The PUD Zone District is specifically intended to: 
1.  Provide an opportunity for the developer and the City to review the type and intensity of development being proposed, and to identify any elements of the proposed plan that may not comply with existing City development standards. 
2.  Provide development opportunities not otherwise permitted within existing zone districts by reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and development standards. 
3.  Permit and encourage innovative design, flexibility, and diversity in land planning and development. 
4.  Provide the opportunity for unified development control for a single parcel or multiple properties in harmony with the environment and respecting the context of the surrounding neighborhoods by establishing design and development standards for the general character of the properties within the PUD. 
5.  Plan for the general configuration of land uses, common elements, major transportation and pedestrian circulation elements, utilities and necessary easements to serve the site and to connect to existing and planned transportation networks, pedestrian networks and utilities. 
6.  Plan for proposed amenities, such as parks, open space and recreational facilities. 
7.  Identify natural features of the site that should be enhanced, protected or remain undeveloped. 
8.  Ensure consistency with the Englewood Comprehensive Plan. 
9.  Provide for the public health, safety, integrity and general welfare, and otherwise achieve the purposes provided in the Planned Unit Development Act of 1972 as amended (C.R.S. 24-67-101, et seq.). 
B.  Applicability. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all lands, uses, and structures to be rezoned to Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zone District. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to: 
1.  Planned Developments (P.D.) approved prior to July 1, 1996, which shall continue to be governed by the respective development plans and the regulations of the underlying zone districts. However, any major amendments to an existing P.D., as determined by the City Manager or designee, shall require review and approval under the new requirements of this Section. 
2.  Any land currently zoned PUD, and partially developed prior to the date of the adoption of this Section. Such approved PUDs may continue and complete such development under the terms and conditions of approval for that PUD. However, any major amendments to an existing PUD, as determined by the City, shall require review and approval under the new requirements of this Section. 
C.  Initiation . 
1.  A proposed rezoning may be initiated by any party identified in Section 16-2-3(A) EMC. All property owners within the boundaries of a proposed PUD zone district shall consent in writing to the application for a PUD. 
2.  A PUD application shall expire one (1) year after submittal unless a public hearing on the application has been held by the Council on or before that date; provided however, that the City Manager or designee may extend the application for six (6) months if the reason for the delay was due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. 
3.  No application for substantially the same PUD shall be accepted within twelve (12) months following a final decision on a prior rezoning application relating to all or any portion of that same property. A "final decision" shall mean denial of a rezoning by the Council. 
D.  Permitted Uses. Uses permitted in a PUD zone district may include any use which is a permitted use in any zone district of the City, or as may be permitted through the unlisted uses determination process of Section 16-5-1(B) EMC Unlisted Uses. Each PUD application shall include its own list of allowed or conditional uses and shall identify applicable design and development standards. A PUD District Plan or a PUD Site Development Plan may vary the provisions of Title 16 EMC, but only to the extent specifically shown on an approved PUD District Plan or Site Development Plan. 
E.  General Use and Development Requirements and Limitations. PUDs shall be subject to the following: 
1.  PUD applications shall only be considered for properties equal to or greater than one-half (1/2) acre. 
2.  Requests for rezoning to a PUD zone district shall be filed on application forms provided by the City, together with all plans, maps and any other information as may be necessary, reasonable and relevant for review by the City. Applications shall be submitted with fees established by City Council resolution. 
3.  Requests for rezoning to a PUD zone district shall be authorized in writing by the landowner(s) or an authorized agent. 
4.  All PUD zone districts shall be established through a map amendment to this Title pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in this Title. 
5.  The terms and conditions of each PUD zone district shall be based on negotiations between the applicant and the City. However, all PUD zone districts shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and applicable provisions of this Title. 
6.  If a PUD proposal requires the creation of one (1) or more new lots of record, or amendment of the boundaries of existing lots of record, then approval of a subdivision plat shall also be required. 
7.  The area of land for the PUD zone district may be controlled by one (1) or more landowners and shall be developed under unified control or a unified plan of development. 
8.  Provisions shall be made for the establishment of an organization for the ownership and maintenance of areas designated as private streets and/or common space unless other adequate arrangements for the ownership and maintenance thereof are provided in a manner acceptable to the City Council. 
9.  The PUD zone district shall be subject to all applicable use and development standards of this Title unless otherwise waived or modified by the applicant and approved by City Council in the terms of the approved PUD. 
F.  Approval Criteria . PUD rezonings shall be made in the interest of promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, and shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. In addition the review or decision making body shall only recommend approval of, or shall only approve, a proposed PUD rezoning if it finds that the proposed rezoning meets the criteria listed below: 
1.  The proposed development shall comply with all applicable use, development, and design standards set forth in this Title that are not otherwise modified or waived according to the rezoning approval. In addition, the proposed rezoning shall meet at least one of the following criteria: 
a.  The proposed development will exceed the development quality standards; levels of public amenities; or levels of design innovation otherwise applicable under this Title, and the proposed development would not be allowed or practicable under a standard zone district with conditional uses or with a reasonable number of Zoning Variances or Administrative Adjustments; or 
b.  The property cannot be developed, or no reasonable economic use of the property can be achieved, under the existing zoning, even through the use of conditional uses or a reasonable number of Zoning Variances or Administrative Adjustments. 
2.  All PUD rezonings shall meet the following criterion: 
a.  The resulting rezoned property will not have a significant negative impact on those properties surrounding the rezoned area and the general public health, safety and welfare of the community will be protected. 
G.  PUD Approval Process Summary : The Planned Unit Development zone district requires three (3) steps for PUD project review and approval: 1) Pre-application review and neighborhood meeting; 2) PUD District Plan review and approval; 3) PUD Site Development Plan review and approval. If an applicant provides site-specific development plans, the PUD District Plan and PUD Site Development Plan steps may be combined. 
The PUD rezoning may be processed in one (1) phase or two (2), at the option of the developer. A complete and final PUD shall not take effect until and unless all of the information required below for both a PUD District Plan and a PUD Site Development Plan have been reviewed and approved by the City. 
The PUD District Plan is a general plan for the land within the boundaries of the application, and includes general land uses and densities, building heights, general design intent, parking ratios, and a conceptual layout of the site. Approval of PUD District Plan requires a later approval of a PUD Site Development Plan prior to any development or issuance of a Building Permit.

Zoning Variances are addressed in this section, and Floodplain Variances are addressed in Chapter 16-4 EMC - (Floodplain Regulations). (Note that the Planning Commission is the decision-making body on Floodplain Variances rather than the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.) The Board of Adjustment and Appeals pursuant to the procedures in this Section may grant Zoning Variances from the zoning provisions of this Title otherwise applicable to a property. 
A.  Jurisdiction/Scope for Zoning Variances.

2.  The Board shall have the authority to require any reasonable stipulation or condition that might be necessary to properly protect the general welfare when granting a Zoning Variance. 
3.  The Board's granting of Zoning Variances shall not result in any encroachment into a recorded easement or right-of-way.

Following such hearing, the Board shall make written findings either approving, conditionally approving, or denying the Zoning Variance. The decision on whether to approve or deny an application for a Zoning Variance shall be in writing, based upon substantial evidence presented at the public hearing. A copy of the decision of the Board shall be provided to the applicant. 

F.  Criteria for Considering a Zoning Variance. 
1.  General Zoning Variances. In passing upon Zoning Variances that do not involve provisions of the Sign Code, the Board may vary the application of the regulations set forth in this Title only if the Board finds the following: 
a.  That unique physical conditions exist, such as size, shape, location, topography or surroundings, which are peculiar to the land or structure involved, which deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity; and 
b.  The variance is consistent with the intent of the zone district regulations to secure public health, safety and welfare; and 
c.  The variance will not permanently impair the use or development of adjacent conforming properties or alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and 
d.  The variance is not a self-imposed difficulty or hardship. 
2.  Sign Code Variances. In passing upon Zoning Variances to the Sign Code, Section 16-6-13 EMC, the Board may vary the application of the regulations set forth in this Title only if it determines that: 
a.  There are special circumstances or conditions such as the existence of buildings, topography, vegetation, sign structures, or other matters on adjacent lots or within the adjacent public right-of-way, which would substantially restrict the effectiveness of the sign in question; provided, however, that such special circumstances or conditions must be peculiar to the particular business or enterprise to which the applicant desires to draw attention, and do not apply generally to all businesses or enterprises; and 
b.  The variance will not weaken the general purpose of this Title nor the regulations prescribed for the district in which the sign is located; and 
c.  The variance will not alter the essential character of the district in which the sign is located; and 
d.  The variance will not substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use of adjacent conforming property. 
G.  After Approval. 
1.  All Zoning Variances shall be effective on the date of final action by the Board. For the purpose of this subsection, final action by the Board shall be deemed to be the approval of the findings of fact for the Zoning Variance request. 
2.  The City shall record all Zoning Variances with the office of the Arapahoe County Clerk and Recorder. 
3.  Any Zoning Variance granted by the Board shall run with the land unless the Board specifies otherwise as a condition of the Zoning Variance. 
4.  Any Zoning Variance granted by the Board shall automatically lapse within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date it was effective, or within such other time as the Board may prescribe, unless a building permit for the action that was the subject of the variance is obtained and work started. 
H.  Post Decision Remedies. Initiation of the following remedies must occur within thirty (30) days of the Board decision. For the purpose of this subsection, Board decision shall be the vote on the Zoning Variance request. 
1.  Rehearing. If the applicant or an interested third party finds evidence that was not available at the time of the hearing that may materially bear on the case, a request for a rehearing may be made to the Board. The request shall be in writing and contain the following: 
a.  A summary of the new evidence. 
b.  The reason the evidence was not available to the Board at the original hearing. 
c.  A statement as to why it is believed that the evidence will materially affect the decision of the Board.

16-2-17: - Administrative Adjustments. 
A.  Purpose. The City Manager or designee may vary, in minor ways, some provisions of this Title otherwise applicable to a property pursuant to the procedures in this Section. Administrative Adjustments are to be used when the small size of the adjustment requested, and the unlikelihood of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary to complete a formal Zoning Variance process. In addition, the Federal Fair Housing Act, as amended, requires that local governments be prepared to make "reasonable accommodations" in order to permit housing for certain protected groups to occur in certain types of residential areas. Administrative adjustments may be used when the City determines that an adjustment to the provisions of this Title is required or advisable to comply with these requirements of the Federal Fair Housing Act. 

B.  Initiation. An application for an Administrative Adjustment may be initiated by those parties identified in Section 16-2-3.A. 
C.  Notice. The City shall require that the applicant notify adjacent property owner(s) and/or occupant(s) by written notice of any application for Administrative Adjustment. 
D.  Permitted Adjustments. 
1.  General Rules. 
a.  Except when requested as a reasonable accommodation for Federal Fair Housing Act ("FFHA") purposes, a request for an Administrative Adjustment shall not be used to further modify a development standard that, as applied to the subject property, already qualifies as an exception to, or modification of, a generally applicable development standard required under Chapter 16-6 EMC, (Development Standards). For example, the developer of a residential project that qualifies for a special variation in the required side setback under the residential design provisions in Section 16-6-10.B EMC, cannot seek an Administrative Adjustment to further reduce the side setback allowed under the special variation. 
b.  Unless specifically stated in the Scope of Authority below, the City Manager or designee shall not approve any Administrative Adjustment that results in an increase in permitted maximum development density or intensity; a change in permitted uses; an increase in building height; or a decrease in the amount of common or dedicated open space required by this Title or other City policies, standards, or regulations. 
2.  Scope of Authority-All Adjustments Except Reasonable Accommodations Under FFHA. An application for an Administrative Adjustment that is not related to a request for "reasonable accommodation" under the Federal Fair Housing Act may request only the following types of adjustments: 
a.  Setbacks: Adjustments to any setback standard may be permitted as follows: 
TABLE 16-2-17.1: 
PERMITTED ADJUSTMENTS TO SETBACKS Required Setback Permitted Maximum Adjustment 3 feet 6 inches 5 feet 1 foot 7 feet 1 foot 20 feet 2 feet 25 feet 3 feet  
  
b.  Principal Dwelling Unit Expansion: Adjustments may be permitted to the front and/or side setback standards for one-unit residential dwellings to allow expansion of the principal dwelling's habitable space to match an existing front setback encroachment as follows: 
(1)  The front and/or side setback encroachment existed on the effective date of this Title. 
(2)  The linear frontage of the facade of the expansion shall be less than or equal to the linear frontage of the portion of the dwelling that already encroaches into the setback. (See Figure 16-2(1): C must be less than or equal to B.) 
(3)  The addition or expansion shall not extend beyond the front and/or side building line of the principal dwelling (not beyond the leading edge of the existing encroachment.) However, no addition or expansion may encroach more than five feet (5') into the required front setback. (See Figure 16-2(1): A may not be greater than five feet (5'). 

c.  Existing Front Porch: Adjustments may be permitted to existing, unenclosed, covered front porches that encroach into the front setback, subject to compliance with the following conditions: 
(1)  The porch encroached into the front setback prior to the effective date of this Title. 
(2)  The adjustment shall not increase the existing encroachment into the front setback; and 
(3)  The porch shall not be enclosed. 
d.  Off-Street Parking: Adjustments of ten percent (10%) or less of the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces, as set forth in Section 16-6-4 EMC, except such adjustment is not available for one-unit or multi-unit uses containing two (2) dwelling units. 
e.  Minimum Lot Width or Lot Area: Adjustments may be permitted to the minimum lot width or minimum lot area in the "Summary Table of Dimensional Requirements for Principal Uses and Structures" in Section 16-6-1 of this Title, subject to the following requirements: 
(1)  The adjustment shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the required minimum lot width or minimum lot area; and 
(2)  The adjustment in the minimum lot width or minimum lot area may result in an alternate permitted land use in the base zone district where the property is located; and 
(3)  A development for which a minimum lot width or minimum lot area adjustment is granted shall not be eligible for additional variances or additional administrative adjustments based on the reduced lot width or area; and 
(4)  The result of an approved adjustment may result in an increase in the maximum development density or intensity; for residential developments, the result of the administrative adjustment shall not exceed one (1) additional residential dwelling unit. 
3.  Scope of Authority-Reasonable Accommodations Under the FFHA. In response to a written application identifying the type of housing being provided and the portions of the Federal Fair Housing Act that require that reasonable accommodations be made for such housing, the City Manager or designee is authorized to take any of the following actions in order to provide reasonable accommodations without the need for a rezoning or Zoning Variance: 
a.  Modify any facility spacing, building setback, height, lot coverage, or landscaping requirement by no more than ten percent (10%); or 
b.  Reduce any off-street parking requirement by no more than one (1) space. 
c.  The City Manager or designee may approve a type of reasonable accommodation different from that requested by the applicant if the City Manager or designee concludes that a different form of accommodation would satisfy the requirements of the Federal Fair Housing Act with fewer impacts on adjacent areas. The decision of the City Manager or designee shall be accompanied by written findings of fact as to the applicability of the Fair Housing Act, the need for reasonable accommodations, and the authority for any reasonable accommodations approved. Requests for types of accommodation that are not listed above may only be approved through a Zoning Variance or rezoning process. 
E.  City Review and Decision. 
1.  The City Manager or designee shall review the proposed Administrative Adjustment, and may refer the application to any department or agency for its review and comments. 
2.  The applicant shall provide a Site Improvement Plan, written request and justification for the adjustment, proof of adjacent property notification, and any other document or materials appropriate to the application. 
3.  Following such reviews, the City Manager or designee shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application. Denials of Administrative Adjustments by the City Manager or designee may be heard before the Board pursuant to Section 16-2-16 EMC, "Zoning Variances". 
F.  Criteria. An Administrative Adjustment shall only be approved by the City Manager or designee if it meets all of criteria 1 through 5 below, or if it meets criteria 6 below: 
1.  The requested adjustment is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the stated purpose of this Title. 
2.  The requested adjustment meets all other applicable building and safety codes. 
3.  The requested adjustment does not encroach into a recorded easement. 
4.  The requested adjustment will have no significant adverse impact on the health, safety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners or the general public, or such impacts will be substantially mitigated. 
5.  The requested adjustment is necessary to either: (a) compensate for some practical difficulty or some unusual aspect of the site of the proposed development not shared by landowners in general; or (b) accommodate an alternative or innovative design practice that achieves to the same or better degree the objective of the existing design standard sought to be modified. For purposes of this provision only, determination of "practical difficulty or some unusual aspect" may include consideration of: 
a.  The historic aspect and development of the subject property; 
b.  The use and development of the subject property compared to similar properties in the vicinity and in the same zone district; 
c.  The property's use and development under previously applicable zoning, as relevant; 
d.  Any intervening public action (e.g., condemnation for public right-of-way); or 
e.  Other similar factors that support a finding of a practical difficulty or unusual aspect that is not of the applicant's own making or under the applicant's direct control. 
6.  The requested adjustment is required or advisable to comply with the requirements of the Federal Fair Housing Act, and does not create significant adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhood.

(Ord. 04-5) 
16-2-19: - Vested Rights. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of C.R.S. Article 68 of Title 24, which establish vested property right to undertake and complete development and use of real property under the terms and conditions of an approved "site-specific development plan," and which further establish the applicable rules and regulations governing applications for a site-specific development plan. 
B.  Applicability. A vested property right shall attach only to an approved site-specific development plan. A "site-specific development plan" shall mean final approval after the effective date of this Title, including the applicant's acceptance of any terms and conditions of approval, of any of the following types of applications: 
1.  Final Major Subdivision Plats; 
2.  Conditional use permits; and 
3.  Site Improvement Plans. 
C.  Process Requirements for Vested Rights Notice and Hearing. 
1.  Final Subdivision Plats. In the case of final subdivision plats, the notice and public hearing requirements for a statutory vested property right shall be satisfied by the notice and public hearing before the Commission to consider the preliminary subdivision plat pursuant to this Title, and the Commission shall indicate that such vested right shall only be created upon approval of the required final plat by the Council pursuant to Section 16-2-10 EMC. 
2.  Conditional Use Permits. In the case of conditional use permits, the notice and public hearing requirements for a statutory vested property right shall be satisfied by the notice and public hearing before the Commission to consider the conditional use pursuant to Section 16-2-12 EMC. 
3.  Site Improvement Plans. In the case of Site Improvement Plans, which are approved by the City Manager or designee pursuant to Section 16-2-9 EMC, the notice and public hearing requirements for a statutory vested property right shall be satisfied by a separate hearing before the Council following the City Manager or designee's decision on the Site Improvement Plan. The applicant shall request a vested right hearing within thirty (30) days following the approval of the Site Improvement Plan, or the right to request such a hearing shall be waived. 
D.  Criteria for Review of Vested Rights Requests. In addition to the review criteria for the particular type of development application designated as the site-specific development plan, an application for approval of a vested property right shall evidence compliance with the following criteria: 
1.  The site-specific development plan describes with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of development and provides adequate information regarding all factors that could affect the type and intensity of development. 
2.  The City's grant of vested rights is reasonable given the proposed development's benefits to the surrounding properties, surrounding community, or to the City in general. 
3.  The applicant provides adequate assurances to the City that the development will go forward as planned in return for the vesting of property rights allowed by Colorado law. 
E.  Start Date of Vesting Period. The starting date of the statutory vesting period for an approved site-specific development plan shall be the date of publication, in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Englewood, of a notice advising the general public of the site-specific development plan approval and creation of a vested property right pursuant to this Section and Colorado law. Such publication shall occur no later than fourteen (14) days following approval of the final subdivision plat or conditional use permit, or no later than fourteen (14) days following the Council's decision to grant a vested property right for a Site Improvement Plan, as applicable. 
F.  After Approval. 
1.  Final approval of a site-specific development plan shall create a vested right to undertake and complete development and use of real property pursuant to Colorado Statutes, but only as to those terms and conditions contained in the approved site-specific development plan. 
2.  The grant of a vested property right in an approved site-specific development plan shall not prevent the City, in subsequent actions, from applying any of the following to the subject property: 
a.  New ordinances, rules, regulations, and policies that do not conflict with those rules, regulations, and policies in effect as of the site-specific development plan's effective date of approval; 
b.  New ordinances, rules, regulations, and policies that are specifically anticipated and provided for in the terms or conditions of the approved site- specific development plan; 
c.  New ordinances, rules, regulations, and policies that are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety; or 
d.  New ordinances, rules, regulations, and policies when the City finds that the site-specific development plan is based on substantially inaccurate information supplied by the applicant. 
3.  A vested property right shall remain vested for a period of three (3) years from the start date of vesting, unless a longer term is agreed to by the City in a Development Agreement (see Section 16-2-15 EMC). An amendment to any site-specific development plan shall not extend the period of vested rights, unless otherwise authorized by agreement approved by the City. 
G.  Plat or Plan Language Required. Each site-specific development plan shall contain the following language: "Approval of this plan [or plat] creates a vested property right subject to all conditions of approval pursuant to C.R.S. Section 24-68-103 et. seq., as amended. The effective date of vesting is [insert date]." 
H.  Pending Applications for a Site-Specific Development Plan-Applicable Rules and Regulations. 
1.  General Rule. Pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes, the review, approval, approval with conditions, or denial of a complete application for a site-specific development plan shall be governed by the duly adopted laws and regulations in effect at the time a complete application for a site-specific development plan is submitted pursuant to this Section and Chapter. 
2.  Exception. Notwithstanding the limitations contained in subsection 1 above, the City may apply to the pending complete application for a site-specific development plan any subsequently enacted or amended ordinances, rules, regulations, or policies that are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety. 
3.  Definition of "Complete Application for a Site-Specific Development Plan". For purposes of this subsection, a "complete application for a site-specific development plan" shall be defined as set forth in Chapter 16-11 EMC and shall refer only to a complete application for approval of a final Major Subdivision Plat, conditional use permit, or Site Improvement Plan. For purposes of this subsection, each separately numbered section of this Chapter (Sections 16-2-1 through 16-2-17 EMC) sets forth a completely separate approval process for a particular development application. None of the procedures contained in any numbered section (such as rezoning review) shall be interpreted to be the first stage of any other procedure in any other numbered section (such as Major Subdivision review). 
I.  Waiver. A landowner may waive a vested property right by separate agreement, which shall be recorded in the office of Arapahoe County Clerk and Recorder. Unless otherwise agreed to by the City, any landowner requesting annexation to the City shall waive in writing any pre-existing vested property rights as a condition of such annexation. 
J.  Other Provisions Unaffected. Approval of a site-specific development plan shall not constitute an exemption from or waiver of any other provisions of this Title pertaining to annexation, development, and use of property. 
(Ord. 04-5; Ord. 29-14,  4) 
Chapter 3 - ZONE DISTRICTS 

16-3-1: - General Provisions. 
A.  Establishment of Base Zoning Districts. The following base zoning districts are hereby established: 
TABLE 16-3-1.1: BASE ZONING DISTRICTS Name Description Residential One Dwelling Unit DistrictsR-1-A A large lot size, one dwelling unit residential district R-1-B A medium lot size, one dwelling unit residential district R-1-C A small lot size one dwelling unit residential zone district Residential One and Multi-Dwelling Unit Districts R-2-A A low-density one and multi-dwelling unit residential zone district R-2-B A medium-density one and multi-dwelling unit residential zone district Mixed-Use Residential/Limited Office-Retail Districts MU-R-3-A A low-density residential and limited office zone district MU-R-3-B A medium to high density residential and limited office zone district MU-R-3-C A high density residential and limited office zone district Mixed-Use Medical Districts M-1 A mixed-use medical, office, and high density residential zone district M-2 A mixed-use medical, office, high density residential and limited retail zone district Mixed-Use Commercial Districts MU-B-1 A mixed-use central business zone district MU-B-2 A general arterial business zone district TSA A mixed-use district intended for land uses adjacent to light rail transit stations Industrial Districts I-1 A light industrial zone district I-2 A general industrial zone district Special Purpose Districts PUD Planned Unit Development  
B.  Relationship of Base Districts to Overlay Districts. Lands within the City may be classified into one of the base zoning districts, as described above, and may also be classified as an overlay district. An overlay district is a land use classification that lies over the base zoning allowing for additional uses and development standards different from the base zoning. Where the property is classified in an overlay district as well as a base zoning district, then the regulations governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying district. In the event of an express conflict between the standards governing a base district and those governing an overlay district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control. 
TABLE 16-3-1.2: OVERLAY DISTRICTS Name Description M-O-2 A medical overlay district covering a portion of the R-2-B base residential zone district. NPO A neighborhood preservation overlay district covering a portion of the MU-R-3-B base residential zone district.  
C.  Compliance with District Standards. No building or structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or altered for use, nor shall any land, building, or structure be used or changed, except in accordance with the zoning district regulations of this Chapter 16-3 EMC, the use regulations of Chapter 16-5 EMC, the development standards of Chapter 16-6 EMC, and all other applicable regulations of this Title. 
(Ord. 04-5; Ord. 08-48,  9; Ord. 09-28,  2; Ord. 23-12,  2; Ord. 26-12,  2; Ord. 8-13,  5) 
16-3-2: - District Characteristics. 
    One of the goals of the City is to encourage a variety of housing types to meet the needs of differing income levels and varying household structures. The regulations for these districts are designed to stabilize and protect the essential characteristics of the districts, to allow for certain conditional and limited uses that are controlled by specific limitations governing the impact of such uses, and to promote a compatible neighborhood environment. 
A.  Residential Districts. The purposes of the residential base zoning districts are set forth below. The allowed uses and use-specific standards for each of the districts are set forth in Chapter 16-5. All uses shall comply with the general dimensional standards set forth in Section 16-6-1 EMC. 
1.  R-1-A, R-1-B, and R-1-C: One dwelling unit residential districts. The R-1 districts primarily consist of one dwelling unit residential neighborhoods. Each district is defined by its dimensional requirements for development of a single lot, such as lot size, lot frontage, setbacks, etc. Multi-unit dwellings are not allowed in these districts. 
2.  R-2-A, R-2-B: One and Multi-Dwelling Unit Residential Districts. The R-2 districts provide a range of housing types between the low-density one-unit areas and the high-density multi-unit areas. The two (2) zone districts allow for a mixture of one-unit development with low and medium density multi-unit housing developments. 
3.  MU-R-2-A, MU-R-3-B and MU-R-3-C: Mixed-Use Residential/Limited Office Districts. The MU-R-3 districts are composed of those areas that are conducive to low, medium, and high-density residential and limited office development of a character unlikely to develop a concentration of traffic and people. To these ends, these districts are protected against the encroachment of general industrial uses and certain commercial uses. 
B.  Mixed-Use Commercial Districts. The uses in these districts are primarily commercial in nature, and the residential development is incorporated into the retail businesses, such as first floor retail, second floor residential. One-unit dwellings are not permitted in these districts. 
1.  MU-B-1: Mixed-Use Central Business District. This district is a mixed-use district that is applied to the central business section of Englewood. The district is designed to create an environment having urban characteristics within a relatively small area of land through the close proximity of activities and increased social and cultural opportunities. The uses within this district are those that provide retailing and personal services to residents of the City and the surrounding area, and are compatible with adjacent development. In order to make the central business district viable twenty-four (24) hours a day, and not just during the traditional business hours, medium and high-density residential units are permitted. 
2.  MU-B-2: Mixed-Use Arterial Business District. This district is composed of certain land and structures used primarily to provide retailing and personal services to the residents of the City and surrounding area and urban residential uses. The MU-B-2 district is usually located on major access routes and is easily accessible from the surrounding residential area which it serves. 
3.  TSA: Transit Station Area. This district is a mixed-use district intended to ensure a diverse mix of uses within convenient walking distance to Regional Transportation District (RTD) light rail stations in the City of Englewood. The district encourages appropriate residential development patterns with sufficient density to support transit use and neighborhoods for residents, as well as commercial retail uses to serve the shopping and service needs of district residents, employees, and commuters. 
4.  M-1: Mixed-Use Medical, Office, and High Density Residential District. This district allows hospitals and medical uses, as well as general office, high density residential, and hotels as primary land uses. 
5.  M-2: Mixed-Use Medical, Office, High Density Residential and Limited Retail District. This district allows hospitals and medical uses as well as general office, high density residential, hotels, and limited retail as primary land uses. 
C.  Industrial Districts. The industrial districts allow for certain uses that are inappropriate in other zone districts due to the impacts associated with their operation, such as noise, dirt, dust, hours of operation, unsightly conditions, traffic, and outdoor storage of equipment and materials. The I districts should be located near major roadways and truck routes so that traffic generated from the I districts will not negatively affect the residential streets in the area. 
1.  I-1: Light Industrial District. This district is intended to provide for light manufacturing and industrial uses, and for warehousing and wholesaling uses of a limited nature and size that do not create appreciable nuisances or hazards. 
2.  I-2: General Industrial District. This district is intended to provide for industrial and manufacturing uses that are more intense in nature than those in the light industrial district. 
D.  Special Purpose Districts. 
1.  PUD: Planned Unit Development District. The PUD district is intended as an alternative to conventional land use regulations. The PUD district combines use, density, design, and Site Improvement Plan considerations into a single process, and substitutes procedural protections for many of the substantive requirements of this Title. Designation of a PUD district shall comply with the procedural requirements of Section 16-2-7 EMC. 
2.  M-O-2: Medical Overlay District. This overlay district covers a portion of the R-2-B base residential zone district and allows a property the option to develop under R-2-B regulations or under M-2 regulations when it is included as part of a larger adjacent M-2 zoned site with street frontage on Hampden Avenue. Retail use shall be prohibited in the M-O-2 overlay district. 
3.  NPO: Neighborhood Preservation Overlay District. An overlay district covering a portion of the MU-R-3-B base residential zone district that is intended to preserve the existing character and balance of land uses within a mature residential neighborhood area. Existing multi-unit developments retain rights to redevelop at existing residential density levels and subject to all other MU-R-3-B zone district dimensional standards. Existing single unit homes may only be redeveloped as similar single and two unit developments.

Chapter 4 - FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 10-44,  1, adopted Nov. 1, 2010, amended Ch. 4 in its entirety and enacted the provisions set out herein. The former Ch. 4 pertained to Flood Plain Overlay District and derived from Ord. 04-5. 

16-4-1: - Authority and Purpose. 
A.  Statutory Authority. The legislature of the State has in Title 29, Article 20 C.R.S., as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry by minimizing flood losses. 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas that cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately anchored, elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
C.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Protect property and minimize damage to critical facilities infrastructure and other public facilities such as water, sewer, and gas mains; electrical and communications stations; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
3.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
4.  Protect the natural areas required to convey flood flows so that they develop in a manner consistent with reasonable floodplain management; 
5.  Protect and preserve the water-carrying characteristics and capacities of all watercourses, including gulches, sloughs, and artificial water channels used for the conveyance of storm and floodwater; 
6.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
7.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
8.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
9.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area. 
D.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter uses the following methods: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers, including fences and walls, which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-2: - Jurisdiction and Applicability. 
A.  Applicability. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all land within the City defined as: 
1.  The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study - Arapahoe County, Colorado, and Incorporated Areas" dated April 18, 2018 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto, and 
2.  The boundaries of the West Harvard Gulch Flood Hazard Area as shown on Sheets 13 and 14 in a report entitled "Flood Hazard Area Delineation, Harvard Gulch, West Harvard Gulch, and Dry Gulch" dated December 1979, prepared by Gingery Associates, Inc., and approved by the Colorado Water Conservation Board on January 30, 1980. 
3.  Flood Hazard Area delineated as Harvard Gulch and Dry Gulch prepared by Matrix Design Group in February of 2017, and approved by the Colorado Water Conservation Board on January 23, 2018. 
The above Official Flood Studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Title. 
B.  Basis for Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas. The City hereby establishes floodplains and floodways whose boundaries are those of the designated 100-year floodplain, special flood hazard areas and the designated floodways as are shown or tabulated in the Flood Insurance Study for the City of Englewood. 
C.  Compliance. No structure or land located in a special flood hazard area shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, altered or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and all other applicable regulations. These regulations meet the minimum requirements set forth by the Colorado Water Conservation Board and the National Flood Insurance Program. 
1.  Floodplain Development Permit. A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required prior to commencement of any construction or other development to ensure conformance with the provisions of this Chapter. 
2.  Certificate of Compliance. 
a.  No vacant land shall be occupied or used and no building shall be hereafter erected, altered, or moved on the floodplains of any watercourse, nor shall such buildings be occupied, until a certificate of compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator. 
b.  The applicant shall submit a certification by a registered Colorado professional engineer to the Floodplain Administrator that the finished fill and building floor elevations, floodproofing measures, or other protection factors were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. This certification shall also state whether or not the structure contains a basement. Within ten (10) days after receipt of such certification from the applicant, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a certificate of compliance only if the building or premises and the proposed use thereof, conform with all of the requirements of this Chapter. 
D.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. The regulations of this Chapter shall be construed as being supplementary to the regulations imposed on the same lands by the underlying zone classification. This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easement, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter and other ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall apply. 
E.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the City, and shall be deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State Statutes. 
F.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection intended to be provided by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific considerations. Larger floods may occur on occasions, or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that the areas outside of special flood hazard areas or land uses permitted within such areas will always be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
G.  Severability. See Section 16-1-10 EMC, (Severability).

i.  The relationship of the proposed use to Roadmap Englewood: 2003 Englewood Comprehensive Plan, as amended. 
3.  Floodplain Administrator Decisions on Permits for Public Facilities or Utility Development in a Floodway. Subject to Section 16-4-10 EMC, (Development in Floodways), the Floodplain Administrator shall act on an application for public facilities or utility development in a floodway within thirty (30) days from receiving the application. 
4.  Conditions Attached to Development Permits. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall attach such conditions, in addition to those required by the Floodplain Development Permit, as are necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter. Such conditions may include specifications for, without limitation because of, specific enumeration, modification of waste disposal methods and facilities, landscaping, period of operation, operational controls, sureties, deed restriction, and adequate floodproofing. 
B.  Floodplain Development Permit Criteria. 
1.  Structures Accessory to Open Uses. Structures accessory to open uses permitted in Section 16-4-3 EMC, (Permitted Uses), whether temporary or permanent, may be permitted only upon a determination by the Floodplain Administrator that: 
a.  Structures will not be designed for human habitation. 
b.  Structures will have low flood damage potential. 
c.  The structure or structures, if permitted, will be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwaters. 
1)  Whenever possible, structures will be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flow of floodwaters. 
2)  So far as is practicable, structures will be placed so that their longitudinal axis are approximately on the same line as those of adjoining structures. 
3)  Structures will be firmly anchored to prevent the structure or building from floating away and thus threatening to further restrict bridge openings and other restricted sections of the stream or river. 
4)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
5)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
6)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
2.  Other Structures, Temporary or Permanent, to be Occupied by People. Other structures, whether temporary or permanent, which are to be occupied by people, may be permitted only upon a finding by the Floodplain Administrator that: 
a.  Such structures shall comply with Section 16-4-7 EMC, (Floodplain Development Permit); and Section 16-4-11 EMC, (Minimum Floodproofing Criteria). 
b.  The lowest floor, including the basement, of any structure to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, or moved on or within a special flood hazard area, shall be constructed at or above a point one foot (1') above the 100-year flood elevation for the particular area and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen feet (15') beyond the limits of any structure or building erected thereon. 
c.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure and to withstand hydrodynamic loads. 
3.  Fills or Deposition of Materials. Fills or deposition of materials may be permitted only upon a finding by the Floodplain Administrator that: 
a.  Any fill or deposition of materials will comply with applicable sections of Chapter 16-6 EMC, (Development Standards). 
b.  The fill or deposition of materials will have some beneficial purpose and the amount thereof will not be greater than is necessary to achieve that purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the owner showing the final dimensions of the proposed fill or other material and the use to which the filled land will be put. 
c.  The fill or deposition of materials does not encroach on that portion of the floodplain, which would have significant and perceptible flow during the flood, and which for that reason would help convey the floodwaters. 
d.  The fill or other materials will be protected against erosion by riprap, strong vegetative cover, or bulkheading. 
4.  Storage or Processing of Materials. The storage or processing of materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in time of flooding, could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be above the flood protection elevation for the particular area or floodproofed in compliance with Section 16-4-11 EMC, (Minimum Floodproofing Criteria). Solid waste disposal facilities, such as salvage yards or areas for the dumping of refuse or the storage of non-operable vehicles, shall not be permitted. 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-8: - Floodplain Regulations. 
    The following regulations shall apply to all uses within a special flood hazard area, notwithstanding that such uses may be specifically permitted under the terms of this Chapter: 
A.  Flood Protection Elevation or Height. The flood protection elevation or height shall correspond to a point one foot (1') above the elevation or "flood profile" shown on or attached to the FIRM. 
B.  Flood-Carrying Capacity. No floodplain uses shall adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of any channel, any tributary to any main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or systems; nor shall any watercourse be altered or restricted unless the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. 
C.  General Standards. In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
1.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;

5.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
6.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and, 
7.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
8.  All manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
D.  Specific Standards. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Subsections 16-4-2(B) EMC - (Basis for Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas), 16-4-6(B)(5) EMC, or 16-4-13(D) EMC - (Subdivision Plats), the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), elevated to one foot (1') above the base flood elevation. A registered Colorado professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall certify and submit the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, to the Floodplain Administrator. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction. With the exception of Critical Facilities, outlined in Subsection 16-4-8(H) EMC - (Standards for Critical Facilities), new construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), elevated to one foot (1') above the base flood elevation or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that at one foot (1') above the base flood elevation, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
A registered Colorado professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this Subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator. 
3.  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1') above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
E.  Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within special flood hazard areas established in Subsection 16-4-2(A) EMC - (Applicability) are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1'-3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
1.  Residential Structures: All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot (1') above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least three feet (3') if no depth number is specified). 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
2.  Non-residential Structures: With the exception of Critical Facilities, outlined in Subsection 16-4-8(H) EMC - (Standards for Critical Facilities), all new construction and substantial improvements shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot (1') above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least three feet (3') if no depth number is specified), or; 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure is watertight to at least one foot (1') above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer or architect. Such certification shall be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. 
3.  Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
F.  Alteration of a Watercourse. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse within a special flood hazard area, the following standards apply: 
1.  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall appropriately consider issues of sediment transport, erosion, deposition, and channel migration and properly mitigate potential problems through the project as well as upstream and downstream of any improvement activity. A detailed analysis of sediment transport and overall channel stability should be considered, when appropriate, to assist in determining the most appropriate design. 
2.  Channelization and flow diversion projects shall evaluate the residual 100-year floodplain. 
3.  Any channelization or other stream alteration activity proposed by a project proponent must be evaluated for its impact on the regulatory floodplain and be in compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local floodplain rules, regulations and ordinances. 
4.  Any stream alteration activity shall be designed and sealed by a registered Colorado professional engineer or Certified Professional Hydrologist. 
5.  All activities within the regulatory floodplain shall meet all applicable Federal, State and City of Englewood floodplain requirements and regulations. 
6.  Within the Regulatory Floodway, stream alteration activities shall not be constructed unless the project proponent demonstrates through a Floodway analysis and report, sealed by a registered Colorado professional engineer, that there is not more that a 0.00-foot rise in the proposed conditions compared to existing Floodway conditions resulting from the project, otherwise known as a No-Rise Certification, unless the community first applies for a CLOMR and Floodway revision in accordance with Subsection 16-4-8(D) EMC - (Specific Standards). 
7.  Maintenance shall be required for any altered or relocated portions of watercourses so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
G.  Properties Removed from the Floodplain by Fill. A Floodplain Development Permit shall not be issued for the construction of a new structure or addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR_F), unless such new structure or addition complies with the following: 
1.  Residential Construction: The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to one foot (1') above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction: The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to one foot (1') above the Base Flood Elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facility be designed so that the structure or addition is watertight to at least one foot (1') above the base flood level that existed prior to the placement of fill with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
H.  Standards for Critical Facilities. A Critical Facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that if flooded may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood. 
1.  Classification of Critical Facilities. It is the responsibility of the City to identify and confirm that specific structures in the community meet the following criteria. 
Critical Facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) Essential Services; (b) Hazardous Materials; (c) At-risk Populations; and (d) Vital to Restoring Normal Services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities, and transportation lifelines. These facilities consist of: 
(1)  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage, and emergency operation centers); 
(2)  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions, and non-ambulatory surgical structures but excluding clinics, doctors' offices, and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
(3)  Designated emergency shelters; 
(4)  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio, and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables, and conduit); 
(5)  Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines, and service lines); and 
(6)  Air Transportation lifelines (airports, municipal and larger), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure (aviation control towers, air traffic control centers, and emergency equipment aircraft hangars). 
(7)  Exemptions. 
(a)  Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), non-potable water treatment and distribution systems, and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances. 
(b)  Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this Section, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials.

Facilities shall be determined to be Critical Facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place, and the chemical(s) is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a Critical Facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either five hundred (500) pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the three hundred fifty-six (356) chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R.  302 (2010) also known as Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS); or ten thousand (10,000) pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R.  1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification." 40 C.F.R.  302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards.) 29 C.F.R.  1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this ordinance, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations. 
(2)  Specific exemptions to this category include: 
(a)  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
(b)  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction, by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority), that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
(c)  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. 
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as Critical Facilities under another category outlined in this Section.

d.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services including government operations. 
(1)  These facilities consist of: 
(a)  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); 
(b)  Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices, and classrooms only). 
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the City that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this ordinance, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City on an as-needed basis upon request. 
(2)  Protection for Critical Facilities. All new and substantially improved Critical Facilities and new additions to Critical Facilities located within the special flood hazard area shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be Critical Facilities. For the purposes of this ordinance, protection shall include one (1) of the following: 
(a)  Location outside the special flood hazard area; or 
(b)  Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two feet (2') above the Base Flood Elevation.

(Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-10: - Development in Floodways. 
    Floodways are administrative limits and tools used to regulate existing and future floodplain development. The State of Colorado has adopted Floodway standards that are more stringent than the FEMA minimum standard (see definition of Floodway in Section 16-4-16 EMC - (Floodplain Definitions). Located within special flood hazard areas established in Subsection 16-4-2(A) EMC - (Applicability) are area designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a registered Colorado professional engineer in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels (a No-Rise Certification is required) during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If Subsection A., above, is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Section. 
1.  The Floodplain Administrator shall act on an application in the manner above described within thirty (30) days from receiving the application. 
C.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in Base Flood Elevations, provided that the community first applies for a CLOMR and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-11: - Minimum Floodproofing Criteria. 
A.  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures within zones A-AE on the FIRM that do not have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level shall be floodproofed. All floodproofed structures, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be so designed that below the base flood level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. The Floodplain Administrator shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area. 
B.  Floodproofing measures include the following: 
1.  Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement. 
2.  Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters. 
3.  Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures. 
4.  Use of waterproof paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water through walls. 
5.  Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation. 
6.  Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures. 
7.  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
8.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into the floodwaters. 
9.  Pumping facilities for subsurface drainage systems for buildings to relieve external foundation wall and basement floor pressures. 
10.  Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or floating debris. 
11.  Cutoff valves on sewer lines or the elimination of gravity flow basement drains. 
12.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
13.  Other floodproofing measures certified by a registered Colorado professional engineer to be consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area. 
C.  Where a non-residential structure is intended to be made watertight below the base flood level. 
1.  A registered Colorado professional engineer shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable provisions of Section 16-4-7 EMC, "Floodplain Development Permit." 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-12: - Special Flood Hazard Area Amendments. 
    The boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard Areas shall be subject to periodic review and shall be amended in the manner provided by law, to conform to any revised, corrected or additional hydrological data available from Federal, State or regional agencies or from a consulting engineer retained by the City. 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-13: - Subdivision Plats. 
A.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be designed to minimize flood damage. 
B.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
C.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
D.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions that contain at least fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Subsections 16-4-2(B) EMC - (Basis for Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas) and 16-4-5(B) EMC - (Floodplain Administrator Duties and Responsibilities). 
E.  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet requirements of Section 16-4-7 EMC - (Floodplain Development Permit). 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-14: - Floodplain Appeals and Variances. 
A.  General. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this Chapter. 
1.  Appeals and floodplain variance requests shall be processed pursuant to the general zoning appeals and variances requirements of 16-2-18 EMC - (Appeals) and 16-2-16 EMC, (Variances), respectively. 
2.  Those aggrieved by the final decision of the Commission may appeal such decision by appropriate legal action to a court of record having jurisdiction. Such appeal shall be filed no more than thirty (30) days from the date of the Commission's final decision. 
B.  Appeals. The Commission shall hear and decide appeals only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter. 
C.  Variances. 
1.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted to build the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
2.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant items 1-11 in Subsection 16-4-6(B)(2)(d) EMC have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
5.  In passing upon a Floodplain Variance application, the Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this Title. 
6.  Criteria for Considering a Floodplain Variance. The Commission shall grant a Floodplain Variance only upon a showing of good and sufficient cause and determination that: 
a.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
b.  Failure to grant the Floodplain Variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  The granting of a Floodplain Variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws. 
7.  Upon consideration of the above and the intent of this Chapter, the Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this Chapter. 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-15: - Enforcement. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without being in full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and other applicable regulations. Enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter shall be pursuant to Chapter 16-10 EMC, (Enforcement and Penalties). 
(Ord. 10-44,  1; Ord. 8-13,  6) 
16-4-16: - Floodplain Definitions. 
    The following definitions pertain specifically to Chapter 16-4 EMC, (Floodplain Regulations ) and are intended to be used only in the regulation of special flood hazard areas as identified in this Chapter. For the purposes of floodplain regulation, these definitions supersede the same terms as defined in 16-11-2 EMC, (Definition of Word, Term, and Phrases) of this Title. 
    100-Year Flood: A flood having a recurrence interval that has a one-percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded during any given year (1-percent-annual-chance flood). The terms "one-hundred-year flood" and "one percent chance flood" are synonymous with the term "100-hundred flood." The term does not imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every one-hundred years. 
    100-Year Floodplain: The area of land susceptible to being inundated as a result of the occurrence of a one-hundred-year flood. 
    500-Year Flood: A flood having a recurrence interval that has a 0.2-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded during any given year (0.2-percent-chance-annual-flood). The term does not imply that the flood will necessarily happen once every five-hundred years.

    Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM): FEMA digital floodplain map. These digital maps serve as "regulatory floodplain maps" for insurance and floodplain management purposes. 
    Elevated Building: For insurance purposes, a nonbasement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by (i) foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls and openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
    Existing Construction: For the purposes of determining flood insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain regulations adopted by the City.

    Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Flood Profile: A graph or longitudinal profile showing the relationship of the water surface elevation of a flood event to location along a stream or river. 
    Flood Protection Elevation: An elevation one foot (1') above the elevation of "flood profile" of the 100-year flood under existing channel and floodplain conditions. It is one foot (1') above the elevation of the flood for a special flood hazard area as shown on the City's official Flood Insurance Rate Maps maintained in the office of the Community Development Department. 
    Floodplain or Flood-Prone Area: Any land area susceptible to being inundated as the result of a flood, including the area of land over which floodwater would flow from the spillway of a reservoir. 
    Floodplain development permit: A permit required before construction or development begins within any special flood hazard area (SFHA). If FEMA has not defined the SFHA within a community, the community shall require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community including the placement of manufactured homes, so that it may determine whether such construction or other development is proposed within flood-prone areas. Permits are required to ensure that proposed development projects meet the requirements of the NFIP and this floodplain management ordinance. 
    Floodplain Management: The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain regulations. 
    Flood-prone Area: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodproofing: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damage to lands, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. 
    Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. The Colorado statewide standard for the designated height to be used for all newly studied reaches shall be one-half foot (1/2'). Letters of Map Revision to existing floodway delineations may continue to use the floodway criteria in place at the time of the existing floodway delineation. 
    Freeboard: The vertical distance in feet above a predicted water surface elevation intended to provide a margin of safety to compensate for unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood such as debris blockage of bridge openings and the increased runoff due to urbanization of the watershed. 
    Highest Adjacent Grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic Structure: Any structure that is: 
(A)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(B)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(C)  Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(D)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
1.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
2.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): FEMA's official revision of an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), or both. LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective Base Flood Elevation (BFEs), or the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). 
    Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F): FEMA's modification of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway. 
    Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). Any floor used for living purposes which includes working, storage, sleeping, cooking and eating, or recreation or any combination thereof. This includes any floor that could be converted to such a use such as a basement or crawl space. The lowest floor is a determinate for the flood insurance premium for a building, home or business. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured Home: A structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

    Natural Drainage: The pattern of surface and stormwater drainage from a particular site before the construction or installation of improvements or prior to any regrading. 
    New Construction: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the City and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    No-Rise Certification: A record of the results of an engineering analysis conducted to determine whether a project will increase flood heights in a floodway. A No-Rise Certification must be supported by technical data and signed by a registered Colorado professional engineer. The supporting technical data should be based on the standard step-backwater computer model used to develop the 100-year floodway shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM). 
    Recreational Vehicle: A vehicle which is: 
(A)  Built on a single chassis;

    Start of Construction: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

    Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(A)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions, or 
(B)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the City's floodplain regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in NFIP Standards Sections 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5), as amended, is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water Surface Elevation: The height, in relation to the National American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain. 
    Watercourse: A channel, natural depression, slough, artificial channel, gulch, arroyo, stream, creek, pond, reservoir, or lake in which storm runoff and floodwater flows either regularly or infrequently. This includes major drainageways for carrying urban storm runoff.

6.  Prohibited Uses. A blank cell indicates that the use type is prohibited in the zoning district. 
7.  Additional Regulations. Regardless of whether a use category is permitted by right or as a conditional, accessory, limited, or temporary use, there may be additional regulations that are applicable to a specific use. The existence of these use-specific regulations is noted through a reference in the last column of the use summary table entitled "Additional Regulations." References refer to subsections of Section 16-5-2 EMC, "Use-Specific Standards." Such standards apply to all districts unless otherwise specified. 
B.  Unlisted Uses. 
1.  Procedure for Approving Unlisted Uses. Where a particular use category or use type is not specifically allowed under this Title, the use category or type may be permitted by the City Manager or designee upon a finding that the criteria of subsection B.2. below are met. The City Manager or designee shall give due consideration to the intent of this Title concerning the district(s) involved, the character of the uses specifically identified, and the character of the use(s) in question. 
2.  Criteria for Approving Unlisted Uses. The City Manager or designee may allow an unlisted use (permitted, conditional, limited, accessory, or temporary) in the zoning district if he finds that the proposed use has an impact that is similar in nature, function, and duration to the other uses allowed in a specific zoning district. In making such finding, the City Manager or designee shall assess all relevant characteristics of the proposed use, including but not limited to the following: 
a.  The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale; size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises; 
b.  Any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, distribution; any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the processing; 
c.  The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise; enclosed, open, inside or outside the principal building; and predominant types of items stored (such as business vehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap and junk, and raw materials including liquids and powders hazardous or not); 
d.  The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures; 
e.  The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business hours and employment shifts; 
f.  Transportation requirements, including the modal split for people and freight, by volume type and characteristic of traffic generation to and from the site, trip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other uses on the site; 
g.  Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of spaces required per unit area or activity, and the potential for shared parking with other uses; 
h.  The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited to noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation and fumes; 
i.  Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use, including but not limited to water supply, waste water, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or recommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and 
j.  The impact on adjacent properties created by the proposed use will not be greater than that of other uses allowed in the zoning district. 
3.  Effects of Finding by the City Manager or Designee. 
a.  Typical Uses: Added to this Title: 
(1)  The City shall initiate periodic amendments to this Title if the City Manager or designee finds that the particular use or class of use(s) is likely to be common or to recur frequently, or that omission of specific inclusion and reference to this Title is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion. 
(2)  Until final action has been taken on such proposed amendment, the determination of the City Manager or designee shall be binding on all officers and departments of the City. 
b.  Atypical Uses: Determination Binding. In making a determination whether to approve an unlisted use, the City Manager's or designee's determination shall thereafter be binding on all officers and departments of the City, without further action or amendment of this Title, if the City Manager or designee finds the particular use or class of use(s) is of an unusual or transitory nature, or is unlikely to recur frequently. 
c.  Appeals. Appeals of decisions to approve or deny unlisted uses shall be appealed to the Commission.

16-5-2: - Use-Specific Standards. 
A.  Residential Uses. 
1.  Group Living Facility. All group living facilities shall be subject to the following standards, except that, as noted, some of the standards below apply only to group living facilities approved as conditional uses: 
a.  A group living facility approved as a conditional use shall not be significantly different from adjacent uses in terms of appearance, site design, hours of operation, traffic generation, noise, odor, dust, and other external impacts or, if the use is different, any adverse impacts resulting from the use will be mitigated to the maximum extent practicable. 
b.  No group living facility shall be located closer than: 
(1)  Seven hundred fifty feet (750') from any state-licensed child care facility or any elementary, middle, or high school; or 
(2)  One thousand two hundred fifty feet (1,250') from another group living facility. 
(3)  Measurement of Distance. All distances in this Section shall be measured by following a straight line from the nearest point of the property line of the proposed group living facility to the nearest point of the property line of any existing group living facility, childcare facility or school. Measurements based on one inch (1") to one hundred feet (100') Arapahoe County Assessor maps shall be deemed acceptable for this purpose. 
c.  Twenty-four (24) hour supervision shall be provided by qualified staff. 
d.  Any group living facility whose residents include any individual who has been convicted by any court of more than one (1) misdemeanor or felony involving property damage or personal injury that was committed while he or she was a resident of the group living facility shall be deemed to be a public nuisance, and shall be subject to those enforcement actions and penalties applicable to other public nuisances within the City. 
e.  The operator of each group living facility shall submit to the City a photocopy of a valid and current certificate or license issued by the State of Colorado, if any such certificate or license is required for the operation of the facility. The certificate or license shall be submitted prior to initiating operations and on or before December 31 of each calendar year thereafter. 
f.  A group living facility approved as a conditional use shall be considered abandoned if active and continuous operations are not carried on for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months. The use may be reinstated only after obtaining a new conditional use approval. 
g.  As authorized by 42 U.S.C. 3604(f)(9), no group living facility shall provide housing to any individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical danger to the property of others. 
h.  A conditional use permit application for a group living facility shall include provisions for automobile access that will prevent traffic hazards and avoid traffic congestion on adjacent public streets and alleys. 
i.  Structures containing a group living facility shall be no taller than the average height of the three (3) principal structures on the same block located closest to the group living structure. 
j.  All group living facilities shall register with the City prior to commencing operation. 
2.  Live/Work Dwelling. Live/work dwellings are subject to the following standards: 
a.  When the live/work dwelling includes a ground floor at street level, the commercial activity shall occur at least in part on the ground floor of the dwelling, and shall be directly accessible from an adjacent public street, public sidewalk, or Transit Station Area plaza. 
b.  Repair, assembly, or fabrication of goods is limited to the use of equipment appropriately scaled and operated to be reasonably compatible with adjoining live/work uses. 
c.  A live/work dwelling shall not be interpreted to be or include a home occupation, and shall not be subject to the limitations on home occupations stated in this Title. 
3.  Manufactured Home Park. 
a.  Procedure for Development of Manufactured Home Parks. 
(1)  A Manufactured Home Park Development Plan is required. At the time the application is submitted for the manufactured home park planned development, either for the expansion of an existing park or for a new park, the applicant shall submit twenty-five (25) copies of a development plan for the proposed park. This plan shall comply with all applicable City codes and with the provisions of this Chapter. 
(2)  The procedure for processing the development plan shall be in accordance with the same steps and notice requirements as for a PUD rezoning (Section 16-2-7 EMC); however, where additional information or specific procedure is required herein, those provisions shall prevail. 
b.  Standards for Development of Manufactured Home Parks. 
(1)  Manufactured Home Park Site Location. 
(a)  The manufactured home park shall be located on a well-drained site, shall not be within the lines of a 100-year floodplain or flood hazard area, and the site shall be made free from marshes, swamps or other potential breeding places for insects or rodents. The site should not be exposed to undue chronic nuisances such as noise, smoke, fumes, or odors. 
(b)  The topography on the manufactured home park site should be favorable to minimum grading, manufactured home placement, and ease of maintenance. The longitudinal grade for the individual space shall not exceed five percent (5%) and an adequate crown or cross-gradient for surface drainage shall be provided. 
(2)  Information to Accompany the Manufactured Home Park Development Plan. A complete development plan for the purpose of obtaining a manufactured home park permit shall be submitted and shall include information and supporting materials as specified by the City Manager or designee. 
(3)  Minimum Area of Manufactured Home Park. Eight (8) acres. 
(4)  Maximum Density. Eight (8) manufactured home dwelling unit spaces per acre. 
(5)  Maximum Lot Coverage. The maximum coverage of the manufactured home lot shall be thirty-five percent (35%) except as provided herein: 
(a)  Where a roof area, such as a carport or outdoor recreation shelter, is open for fifty percent (50%) or more of its perimeter, its lot coverage shall be computed as one-half (1/2) the area covered by the roof. 
(b)  Where the lot is adjacent and has access to improved common open space, other than vehicular areas, and not less than twenty feet (20') in width, an additional five percent (5%) of the lot may be occupied. 
(6)  Minimum Lot Dimensions and Shapes. Minimum lot widths and areas shall be as required to meet lot coverage and yard, manufactured home and building spacing, and other requirements as set forth herein. So long as these requirements are met, and the resulting layout of the lots is functional and provides for efficient provision of utilities and for convenient pedestrian and vehicular access, lot lines shall not be required to be perpendicular to streets or radial to curves, and lot shapes may take any form, provided, however, that in no case shall any area on the lot more than fifty feet (50') from the manufactured home, nor any portion of the lot less than ten feet (10') in minimum dimension between opposing lot lines, be included in required lot or open space area. 
  
  
  
  
[Rest of Page Intentionally Left Blank] 
(7)  Perimeter Yards. 
(a)  Adjoining Public Streets. Where one (1) or more boundaries of the manufactured home park planned development adjoin public streets, a yard of at least twenty-five feet (25') in depth shall be provided adjacent to such boundary. 
(b)  Adjoining Alleys. Where the boundary of a manufactured home park planned development adjoins an alley, a yard of at least ten feet (10') in depth shall be provided adjacent to such boundary. 
(c)  Adjoining a Residential District. Where a manufactured home park planned development adjoins a residential district (R-1-A, R-1-B, R-1-C, R-2-A, R-2-B, MU-R-3-A, MU-R-3-B) without an intervening street or alley, a yard of at least twenty feet (20') in depth shall be provided adjacent to such boundary. 
(d)  Adjoining a Business or Industrial District. Where a manufactured home park planned development adjoins a business or industrial district (MU-B-1, MU-B-2, TSA, I-1, I-2) without an intervening street or alley, a yard of at least twenty feet (20') in depth shall be provided adjacent to such boundary. 
(e)  Exceptions. If determined necessary in order to provide protection to residents within a manufactured home park planned development from excessive traffic noise, lights or other adverse influences from outside of the development, a greater depth and/or approved screen planting, walls or fences may be required in a yard. Such determination shall be made by the Commission in conjunction with the consideration of the manufactured home park planned development plan. 
(f)  Inclusion as Part of Individual Lots and Yards. Except as otherwise may be specifically provided, the yard may be included in individual lots and used to meet yard or area requirements for the manufactured home thereon, if the yard is appropriately located and improved. 
(g)  Limitations on Use of Yards Adjoining Residential Districts. No group parking facilities and no active recreation facilities for common use shall be located in any required yard adjoining lots in a residential district. 
(8)  Livable Open Space on Lots. Livable open space shall be provided on lots for manufactured homes in an amount equal to not less than ten percent (10%) of the lot area, provided that in no case shall the required livable space be less than three hundred (300) square feet. Such required livable space shall have a minimum dimension of not less than fifteen feet (15'). Such space shall be located for privacy, convenience, and optimum use and shall be walled, fenced or planted to assure reasonable privacy. Within such area, an area suitably surfaced for the placement of garden or lawn furniture shall be provided, which surfaced area shall be not less than one hundred (100) square feet in area with a minimum dimension of ten feet (10'). The surfaced area may be a movable element in order to permit maximum flexibility in providing for a variety of manufactured home widths, floor plans and locations on the lot. This area may be covered with a roof, creating a recreational shelter, subject to limitations on maximum lot coverage. Parking areas and driveways shall not be included in required livable open space. 
(a)  Yards, Open Space Abutting Manufactured Home Units and Spacing of Units. 
(1)  Intent. Yards and other open spaces required herein in relation to the manufactured home dwelling units are intended to perform a variety of functions. Among these are to assure adequate privacy, and to provide usable outdoor living space, a desirable outlook from the principal living room exposure, natural light and ventilation, access to and around the units, off-street parking and spacing between the manufactured home dwellings and between the dwelling unit and other buildings for reducing potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare or hazards from fire. 
It is intended in these regulations to relate requirements to performance of these functions, allowing maximum flexibility in detailed site planning and use in so long as performance standards are met. 
(2)  Dwelling Unit Exposure and Outlook. For purposes of relating requirements to function, yards, and other open spaces around the manufactured home dwelling units, distances between dwelling units and other buildings shall be determined by exposures and outlooks from the portions of the dwelling units involved. Exposures of portions of dwelling units and the minimum open space depth are defined and classified as follows: 
Class A. Portions of walls containing principal living room exposure to outdoor living area through major windows and/or glassed doors. Prime consideration here is direct view of, and convenient access to, outdoor livable space. In cases where two (2) walls of the dwelling unit provide this type of exposure from the living room, either may be selected as the Class A exposure, and the other shall be considered Class C. 
Class A Exposures. Minimum open space depth for Class A exposures shall be fifteen feet (15'). The Class A exposure shall be to livable space, required or other, on the lot, and not to parking area or driveway area. 
Class B. Portions of walls containing the only windows for bedrooms, or principal windows and/or glassed doors for bedrooms, where privacy, moderate outlook, light, and air are principal considerations. 
Class B Exposures. Minimum open space depth for Class B exposures shall be ten feet (10'). This may include livable open space, and parking and driveway areas on the lot. 
Class C. Portions of walls containing secondary windows for bedrooms, windows for kitchens, bathrooms, utility rooms, and the like, secondary windows for living rooms, or exterior doors other than entries with Class A orientation, where windows involved do not involve privacy or are so located, shielded, or are of such a nature that necessary privacy is assured, and where light, air, and fire protection are principal considerations. 
Class C Exposures. Minimum open space depth for Class C exposures shall be eight feet (8'). This may include the same types of open space as for B. 
Class D. Portions of walls containing no windows, doors, or other openings, but not so constructed or safeguarded as to be suitable for attachment to other dwelling units or principal buildings. Principal concern in such cases is with fire protection. 
Class D Exposures. Minimum open space depth for Class D exposures shall be five feet (5'). This may include the same types of open space as for B. 
Class E. Portions of walls containing no windows, doors, or other openings, and so constructed or safeguarded as to provide at least one (1) hour fire protection if it were attached to another manufactured home dwelling unit or to a permitted building. 
Class E Exposures. No minimum open space depth requirements. 
(9)  Distance to Common Areas. Except as provided above, distance from any exposure to a street pavement or to the edge of a common driveway, a common parking area, a common walk, or other common area shall be at least eight feet (8'). For Class A exposure this distance shall be at least fifteen feet (15'). Carports open in a manner which assures compliance with the provisions of subsection (B)(5), "Maximum Lot Coverage," may extend to within four feet (4') of a common sidewalk abutting a street or common parking area, or to within four feet (4') of the street pavement or common parking area if no such sidewalk is involved; but the carport may not be in the required livable space or in any portion of the open space which constitutes a Class A exposure. 
(10)  Carports, Individual Recreational Shelters, Storage Facilities in Required Open Space. 
(a)  Carport. A carport enclosed for fifty percent (50%) or less of its perimeter, and with enclosure of ten percent (10%) or less of the portion of its perimeter opposite any Class B or C exposure, may be located in any portion of the open space on the lot which is not required livable space and does not constitute Class A exposure. 
(b)  Individual Recreational Shelter. An individual recreational shelter as described in subsection (B)(8), enclosed for fifty percent (50%) or less of its perimeter in a manner which does not constitute undesirable impediment to view or fire hazard may be located in any livable space on the lot. 
(c)  Storage Facilities. Storage facilities may be included as part of the enclosure for carports and recreational structures subject to the limitations set forth above. Independent storage structures containing not more than one hundred (100) cubic feet of storage space may be located in any portion of required open space on the lot, provided that as located and constructed such structures do not constitute undesirable impediments to view or fire hazards. 
(11)  Spacing of Manufactured Home Dwelling Units on Abutting Lots. Minimum required distances between manufactured home dwelling units, or additions thereto enclosed for more than fifty percent (50%) of their perimeters, shall be the sum of the required distances for the exposures involved. 
(12)  Equivalent Spacing Alternative. As an alternative to providing required open space between units or portions of units as the sum of adjoining open spaces on individual lots, where equivalent spacing can be assured in a form appropriate to the exposures involved by decreasing clearance from the lot line on one lot and increasing clearance from the lot line on the other, this arrangement may be permitted, provided that access for servicing and maintenance of units involved can be assured, and further, provided that minimum open space depth for Class A exposures shall be located on the same lot as the unit. Thus, for example, in a row of lots on which Class A exposures faced Class C exposures, calling for minimum open space depth of fifteen feet (15') on the lots with Class A exposure and eight feet (8') on the lots with Class C, the units could all be moved to the lot line on the Class C exposure side if the minimum depth on the Class A exposure side was increased to twenty-three feet (23'). 
(13)  Occupancy of Manufactured Homes. 
(a)  No manufactured home shall hereafter be occupied unless it is parked in an approved manufactured home park. 
(b)  No manufactured home shall be occupied in a manufactured home park unless the manufactured home is situated within a designated space and on a HUD approved foundation or on a concrete slab of not less than four inches (4") in thickness and no smaller than the outside dimensions of the manufactured home to be accommodated.

Chapter 6 - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

16-6-1: - Dimensional Requirements. 
A.  Rules of Measurement. 
1.  Residential Density. 
a.  Net Density. Net density shall be calculated by dividing the net acreage of a parcel by the minimum lot area required for each dwelling unit. Net acreage is equal to gross acreage, less land area devoted to public rights-of-way. 
b.  Gross Density. Gross density shall be calculated by dividing the gross acreage of a parcel by the minimum lot area required for each dwelling unit. 
c.  Rounding. When applying a density standard to a parcel's land area, all resulting fractions shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number. 
d.  Maximum Density Not Guaranteed. The number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable site development standards shall be met. The maximum density established for a zone district in this Chapter is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a valid justification for varying other dimensional or development standards. 
2.  Lot Area. Lot area is measured as the amount of gross land area contained within a horizontal plane bounded by the front, side, and rear lot lines (but not including streets or rights-of-way). 
3.  Lot Coverage. 
a.  General Rule. Lot coverage is the percentage of total lot area which, when viewed directly from above, would be covered by a structure or structures, or any part thereof, excluding projecting roof eaves. It is calculated by dividing the square footage of structure cover by the square footage of the lot. Unless specifically exempted by subsection (B) below, the term "structure" includes private walkways, driveways, and other paved surface areas used or intended for parking vehicles (e.g., parking pads). See Figure 16-6(1). 
b.  Exemptions from the calculation of lot coverage. 
(1)  Driveways, or portions thereof, twelve feet (12') or less in width; 
(2)  Private walkways, or portions thereof, five feet (5') or less in width; 
(3)  Areas covered by swimming pools, hot tubs, and ornamental ponds; 
(4)  Open (uncovered) decks or patios less than thirty inches (30") above grade; or 
(5)  Covered, unenclosed porches. 

Commentary to Figure 16-6(1) Lot Coverage [above]: The cross-hatching shown represents total lot coverage, including portions of the lot covered by the principal dwelling and an attached garage, but not including the paved driveway (when the driveway width is twelve feet (12') or less) and not including an unenclosed front porch or narrow front walkway. 
4.  Front Lot Coverage. Front lot coverage is the portion of the front setback or front yard area, whichever is larger, of a residential lot covered by (a) an impervious material, including but not limited to driveways, sidewalks and parking pads, and/or (b) any structure or portion thereof permitted to encroach into the front setback area. Front lot coverage is expressed as a percentage. 

Commentary to Figure 16-6(2) Front Lot Coverage [above]: The cross-hatching shown in this figure illustrates those parts of this home's front setback area that are covered by impervious materials or surfaces-in this case, the portion of the paved driveway within the front setback area and the front walkway between the sidewalk and the home's front porch. The total area covered by those impervious materials or surfaces, divided by the entire area of the front setback, equals the total front lot coverage. 
5.  Lot Width. Lot width refers to the horizontal distance parallel to the front lot line measured between side lot lines at the front setback line, or if no setback line is established, the distance between the side lot lines measured along the street line. 
6.  Setbacks. Setbacks are measured along a line at right angles from the lot line to a point equivalent to the minimum setback. Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for the projections specifically allowed in Section 16-6-1.F EMC. 
7.  Floor Area Ratio (FAR). FAR is measured as the total floor area on a lot divided by the land area of that lot. "Total floor area" includes the total floor areas of the several floors of the structure, as measured by the exterior faces of the walls, including fully enclosed porches and the like as measured by the exterior limits thereof, but excluding: 
a.  Garage space which is in the basement of a building or, in the case of garage space accessory to a dwelling, is at grade; 
b.  Basement and cellar areas devoted exclusively to uses accessory to the operation of the structure; and 
c.  Areas elsewhere in the structure devoted to housing mechanical equipment customarily located in the basement or cellar such as heating and air conditioning equipment, plumbing, and electrical equipment. 
8.  Building or Structure Height. Building or structure height is the vertical distance of a building or structure, as measured from the average elevation of the finished grade at the corners of the building or structure base, to the highest point of the building or structure. When referring to a tower or other similar structure, height is measured from the average ground level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if said highest point is an antenna. 
9.  Street Frontage. Street frontage is the horizontal distance between side lot lines along the front lot line abutting the street. On corner lots, street frontage is measured along both lot lines abutting streets.

b.  Bulkheads, elevator penthouses, observation towers, transmission towers, chimneys, ventilators, smoke stacks, skylights, derricks, conveyors, water towers and tanks, fire towers, hose towers, cooling units, enclosed stairwells, or other structures where the manufacturing process requires a greater height, provided they extend the height of the principal building by no more than thirty percent (30%) above the maximum height permitted in the zone district. 
c.  Chimneys, including chimney termination devices and decorative features, on residential dwelling structures may exceed the height limitation by no more than four feet (4'). 
F.  Setbacks and Yards: Special Regulations. 
1.  Maximum Residential Front Yard. The maximum front yard for any dwelling shall not be greater than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the depth of the lot. 
2.  Maximum Front Lot Coverage. See Section 16-6-10 EMC, "Design Standards and Guidelines," below for limits on total front lot coverage applicable in the residential (R) zone districts. 
3.  Use of Required Setback or Yard by Another Building. No part of a setback, yard, court, or other open space provided for any building or structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Title shall be included as a part of a yard, court, or other open space required under this Title for another building or structure. 
4.  Exceptions to Setback and Yard Requirements. 
a.  Applicability. The exceptions stated in this subsection shall be applicable only in the residential districts (i.e., they are not applicable in the business or industrial districts.) 
b.  Through Lots. At each end of a through lot, there shall be a front setback of the depth required by this Title for the district in which each lot frontage is located. 
c.  Multi-Unit Dwellings. For the purpose of side setback regulations, multi-unit dwellings with common party walls shall be considered as one (1) building occupying one (1) lot. 
d.  Reduction of Setbacks. No required setback around an existing building shall be separated in ownership from the lot upon which the building is located. 
e.  Rear Setbacks for Shallow Lots. If a lot in a residential district was less than one hundred feet (100') deep on the effective date of this Title, the rear setback may be reduced to fifteen feet (15'). 
5.  Permitted Projection Into Setbacks/Yards.

The requirements of this Section are intended to assure the protection of life and property from such related hazards as flammable gas, gas migration, asphyxiation, settlement, and explosion. 
2.  Applicability. Any building, excavation, construction, or other use proposed on or within one thousand feet (1,000') of an operating or former solid waste disposal site ("landfill site") shall require flammable gas testing and approval as indicated in this Section prior to commencing development. 
B.  Review of Proposed Development on Landfill Sites. 
1.  No construction of structures or other land uses shall be allowed on any parcel of land that is or has been a landfill site, until the proposed action is reviewed and approved by the City and the Tri-County District Health Department. 
2.  The applicant shall pay and be responsible for obtaining flammable gas readings from the site and supplying safety information related to construction on the landfill site. 
3.  The City Manager or designee shall review the proposed land use and the proposed engineering design and recommend changes and/or mitigation measures, as necessary, to reduce or avoid potential hazards. 
4.  All comments and recommendations shall be presented to the City Manager or designee for review and decision according to this Section 16-6-2 EMC. 
C.  Standards for Development on Former Landfill Sites. The City shall not issue building permits for any development on a landfill site until the City finds that the following criteria have been met based on the twenty percent (20%) lower explosive limit (LEL) standard formulated by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health of the Bureau of Mines of the U.S. Department of the Interior. 
1.  Flammable gas testing shall be conducted at the proposed site in order to determine if flammable gas is present in concentrations of five percent (5%) or more by volume (five percent (5%) flammable gas is the lower explosive limit). 
2.  All new construction shall be designed by a registered professional engineer to exclude, monitor, and protect against buildup of over one percent (1%) of flammable gas in the building. 
3.  For construction on a known landfill area, the following steps shall be taken during the construction activity: 
a.  A flammable gas indicator shall be utilized at all times during trenching, excavating, drilling, or when working within ten feet (10') of an open excavation. 
b.  When trenching, excavating, or drilling deeper than two feet (2') into the fill, or in the presence of detectable concentrations of one percent (1%) flammable gas, the soils shall be wetted and the operating equipment shall be provided with spark-proof exhausts. 
c.  A dry chemical fire extinguisher, per applicable fire code requirements, shall be provided on all equipment used in the landfill. 
d.  Personnel within or near an open trench or drill hole shall be fully clothed, wear shoes with non-metallic soles, wear a hard hat, and wear safety goggles or glasses. 
e.  Exhaust blowers shall be used in instances where trenches may show a buildup of flammable gas of one percent (1%) or less than eighteen percent (18%) oxygen. 
f.  Smoking shall not be permitted in any area within one hundred feet (100') of the excavation. 
g.  Personnel shall be kept upwind of any open trench unless the trench is continuously monitored. 
h.  Before personnel are permitted to enter an open trench, the trench shall be monitored for flammable gas and at least an eighteen percent (18%) oxygen sufficiency. When in the excavation, each work party shall be working no more than five feet (5') from a continuous flammable gas and oxygen monitor. 
4.  The applicant shall submit an affidavit by a registered professional engineer stating that all testing and monitoring as required by these regulations has been conducted, and stating the result of the testing and monitoring. 
5.  All construction or excavation sites shall be subject to inspection by the City. 
D.  Standards for Development Within One Thousand Feet of Known Landfill Area. The City shall not issue building permits for any development within one thousand feet (1,000') of a known landfill site until the City finds that all of the following safety precautions have been taken: 
1.  The area under construction shall be checked with a flammable gas indicator before excavation in order to determine if flammable gas is in the area. 
2.  Any excavation shall be monitored for the presence of flammable gas reading of a maximum of one percent (1%) and oxygen deficiency reading of a minimum of eighteen percent (18%). This shall be carried out continuously unless there is no presence of flammable gas in the area. 
3.  Should flammable gas of one percent (1%) or oxygen of less than eighteen percent (18%) occur, those precautions applicable to development on a former landfill site as outlined above shall also apply. 
4.  The applicant shall submit an affidavit by a registered professional engineer stating that all testing and monitoring as required by these regulations has been conducted and stating the result of the testing and monitoring. 
5.  Any construction or excavation site shall be subject to inspection by the City. 
E.  Responsibility to Monitor. It shall be the responsibility of the company last operating a landfill site prior to development on or within one thousand feet (1,000') of said landfill site to monitor for the presence of methane gas on and/or within one thousand feet (1,000') of such a site, if gas has previously been detected or if so requested by the City. It shall also be the responsibility of said operator to install methane alarm systems in all structures within one thousand feet (1,000') of a sanitary landfill if so directed by the City.

b.  Compliance with City Standards. Construction and design of all public streets, including alleys, shall conform to the applicable City design and construction standards and specifications. The City may allow exceptions to the street standards on a case-by-case basis, provided that the City shall first find that special circumstances make these standards impractical and that the exception is in conformance with the intent and purpose of the Englewood Municipal Code, or City Engineering Standards and Specifications, and providing that such exception does not lessen the intent of the design requirement, or the level of safety, service, and quality intended by the City Engineering Standards and Specifications minimum requirements. 
c.  Connectivity. 
(1)  The proposed street layout should provide for the continuation or projection of existing streets in the surrounding area unless the City determines that such extension is undesirable for specific reasons of topography or design. 
(2)  Where streets are stubbed to the subject property line, or where arterial, collector, or local streets are designated to connect to the property, the City may require rights-of-way and construction of those streets through and into the area contained within the development application. 
(3)  Street layout and design shall provide for the future projection of principal streets into adjoining, unsubdivided lands. 
(4)  When a proposed street does not allow intersections to be aligned, the center of the proposed street not in alignment shall be offset by a minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150'). 
(5)  Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjoining or abutting the property to be developed, the other half of the street or alley shall be platted or dedicated. 
2.  Street Grade/Consideration of Existing Topography. 
a.  The topography of the land shall be respected and all streets shall be designed to avoid steep grades and deep cuts to the maximum extent feasible given each site's natural topography. 
b.  Unless otherwise determined by the City Manager or designee, street grades should not be less than five-tenths of one percent (0.5%) nor more than six percent (6%) for arterial and collector streets, and not less than five-tenths of one percent (0.5%) nor more than eight percent (8%) for local streets and cul-de-sacs. 
c.  Street grades at intersections shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
d.  All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length of one hundred feet (100'). 
3.  Street Intersections and Curves. 
a.  Intersections. Street intersections shall be at right angles or nearly so and no point on a curve shall be in the intersection unless unusual circumstances dictate divergence. 
b.  Radii of Curvature. The minimum radii of curvature of streets, on centerlines, shall be approved by the City. 
4.  Cul-de-Sacs and Other Dead-End Streets. 
a.  Cul-de-Sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall meet all applicable City standards for design and construction. 
(1)  Pedestrian Connections. The City may require pedestrian ways and bicycle access routes connecting the cul-de-sac to an appropriate street when necessary to permit easy pedestrian circulation and access to adjacent transit service, community facilities such as parks or schools, or employment centers. 
b.  No-Outlet (Dead-End) Streets. Except for cul-de-sacs, no-outlet streets are prohibited except in cases where such streets are designed to connect with future streets on adjacent land, in which case a temporary turnaround easement at the end of the street shall be provided according to City specifications. 
5.  Private Streets. The use of private streets is discouraged. Where used, private streets shall comply with all applicable design standards adopted by the City. The City shall approve all provisions for the maintenance and repair of private streets during the development approval process. 
6.  Alleys. 
a.  General Standards. Alleys are encouraged for residential or mixed-use development. Where alleys are used, they shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)  Minimum alley widths shall comply with Section 16-8-7.E EMC, "Widths of Public Ways." 
(2)  All platted alleys shall be constructed to City standards. 
(3)  The alley shall connect through the block to a publicly dedicated street on each end, with or without turns. 
7.  Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets or for other purposes are prohibited unless such reserve strip is required and controlled by the City. 
8.  Access Roads. Where a development or subdivision adjoins or contains an existing or proposed Arterial street on which traffic volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety considerations, the City may require access roads. 
9.  Utilities. All street and alley development shall accommodate all utility easements, service, and utility cabinet locations. Service cabinets should be located in the least visible and least intrusive locations possible. Utility plans must be approved prior to issuance of the first building permit.

F.  Vehicle Access and Circulation. 
1.  Access to Public Roads. All new lots shall have direct or indirect access to a dedicated public street, through one (1) or more access points approved by the City. In addition to direct access to a dedicated public street, access may be provided through private streets or through alleys. 
a.  No back-out driveways from any type of use shall be permitted onto an arterial street. 
b.  No back-out driveways or back-out parking spaces from multi-unit residential on sites with alley access, commercial, or industrial uses shall be permitted onto a public street. This requirement shall not prohibit back-out driveways or parking spaces onto an alley. 
2.  Traffic Impact Analysis. A traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required with applications for development review and approval when trip generation during any peak hour is expected to exceed one hundred (100) vehicles, based on traffic generation estimates when trip generation during any peak hour is expected to exceed one hundred (100) vehicles, based on traffic generation estimates of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Generation Manual (or any successor publication). The City may also require a TIA for: 
a.  Any project that proposes access to a street with level of service (LOS) "D" or below; 
b.  Any application for a rezoning; 
c.  Any case where the previous TIA for the property is more than two (2) years old; 
d.  Any case where increased land use intensity will result in a fifteen percent (15%) or greater increase in traffic generation; and 
e.  Any case in which the traffic engineer determines that a TIA should be required because of other traffic concerns that may be affected by the proposed development. 
f.  When access points are not defined or a Zoning Site Plan is not available at the time the TIA is prepared, additional studies may be required when a Zoning Site Plan becomes available or the access points are defined. 
3.  New Intersections and Curb-Cuts. 
a.  General Rules. The number of intersections and curb-cuts on streets and highways shall be minimized consistent with the basic needs of ingress and egress. Intersections and curb-cuts shall be designed to provide the greatest safety for both pedestrians and motorists. 
b.  Driveways, Residential. 
(1)  One-Unit and Multi-Unit Dwellings Containing Up to Three (3) Units. 
(a)  The width of any driveway leading from the public street to a one-unit dwelling, or multi-unit dwelling containing up to three (3) units shall not exceed twenty feet (20') at its intersection with the street. 
(b)  See also Section 16-6-1(C)(1) EMC, "Multi-Unit Development Standards in R-2-A, R-2-B, MU-R-3-A, and MU-R-3-B, Districts," for additional driveway standards that apply to multi-unit dwellings on properties with or without alley access. 
(c)  See also Section 16-6-10.B EMC, "Residential Design Standards and Guidelines," for additional driveway standards that apply to new residential development, including substantial expansions or alterations of existing dwellings, in the R-1, R-2, and R-3 zone districts. 
(2)  Multi-Unit Dwellings Containing Four (4) or More Units. 
(a)  The width of any entrance driveway to a multi-unit dwelling containing four (4) or more units shall not exceed twenty-five feet (25') at its intersection with the street, unless the applicant can demonstrate that additional width is required to adequately accommodate anticipated driveway volumes. 
(b)  In new multi-unit developments not located within MU-R-3-C, M-1, M-2 and M-O-2 districts containing ten (10) or more units, vehicular access shall be spaced no closer than twenty-five feet (25') to any adjacent property line. However, the City may reduce this setback requirement to permit a single vehicular access point that can serve two (2) adjacent properties or where compliance with these requirements would deny vehicular access to a property. 
c.  Driveways, Nonresidential. The location and size of driveways leading from the public street to a nonresidential or mixed-use building is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  No portion of any driveway shall be closer than forty feet (40') to the curb line of an intersecting street, or closer than ten feet (10') from a fire hydrant, catch basin, or end of curb radius at corners. 
(2)  In new non-residential developments not located within MU-R-3-C, M-1, M-2, and M-O-2 districts, vehicular access shall be spaced no closer than twenty-five feet (25') to any adjacent property line. However, the City may reduce this setback requirement to permit a single vehicular access point that can serve two (2) adjacent properties or where compliance with these requirements would deny vehicular access to a property. 
(3)  Only one (1) access per street frontage shall be permitted, unless a Zoning Site Plan or traffic impact analysis shows, and the City agrees, that additional access points are required to adequately accommodate driveway volumes and that additional access will not be detrimental to traffic flow. 
(4)  The width of any entrance driveway shall not exceed thirty feet (30') measured along its intersection with the property line.

16-6-4: - Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to prevent or alleviate the congestion of public streets, to enhance parking areas with landscape elements, and to promote the safety and welfare of the public. In recognition that different solutions may be appropriate in different areas of the City and for different types of development, the standards set out in this Section allow flexibility in dealing with vehicle parking and loading issues. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  New Development. The off-street parking and loading standards of this Section shall apply to all new development after the effective date of this Title, except as otherwise expressly allowed in this Title. 
2.  Applicability to Existing Uses. 
a.  No existing use or structure shall be deemed nonconforming solely because of the lack of off-street parking (including bicycle parking) or loading requirements prescribed in this Section, provided that off-street parking and loading facilities existing on the effective date of this Title shall not be reduced in capacity, design, or function to less than the minimum standards prescribed in this Section and Title. 
b.  Off-street parking and loading facilities existing on the effective date of this Title shall be maintained as long as the use or structure exists, even if the amount of parking or loading spaces does not comply with this Section, unless an equivalent number of spaces are provided conforming to the requirements of this Section. 
c.  In connection with an existing use, this Section shall not require the maintenance of more parking or loading spaces than is required for a new building or use under this Section and Title. 
3.  Expansions and Increases in Intensity. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Section, the off-street parking and loading standards of this Section apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged, through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, employees, or other units of measurement used for establishing off-street parking and loading requirements. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces shall be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use. 
4.  Change of Use. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Section, off-street parking (including bicycle parking) and loading facilities shall be provided for any change of use or manner of operation that would, based on the off-street parking schedule or the off-street loading schedule, result in a requirement for more parking or loading spaces than the former use. Additional parking or loading spaces shall be required only in proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use. 
5.  Planned Unit Developments. In Planned Unit Developments, the amount of off-street parking shall be determined on a case-by-case basis as part of the City's consideration of the PUD application. However, the decision-making body may use the off-street parking and loading requirements of this Section as the starting point for determination of the applicable minimum standards. 
C.  No Reduction Below Minimums. Unless otherwise expressly allowed in this Section, existing parking spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements established in this Section. Unless otherwise expressly allowed in this Section, any change in use or manner of operation that increases applicable off-street parking requirements shall be deemed a violation of this Title unless parking spaces are provided according to this Section. 
D.  Computation of Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements. The following rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading requirements: 
1.  Multiple and Mixed Uses. Unless otherwise approved by the City, off-street parking areas serving either (1) more than one principal use, (2) more than one use type within a structure (i.e., office and warehouse), or (3) a mixed-use development must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the combined total of the minimum requirements for each use. 
2.  Fractions. When measurement of the number of required spaces results in a fractional number the fraction shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
3.  Area-Based Standards. 
a.  Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based parking and loading standards (e.g., one (1) parking space per three hundred (300) square feet of office use) shall be computed on the basis of gross leasable or rentable floor area (i.e., excluding square footage of floor area devoted to common or public areas, hallways, and bathrooms). 
b.  When the standard states that an off-street parking area shall be provided based on the gross floor area of a specific use (e.g., "an area equal to the gross floor area"), calculations shall be based on a requirement of three hundred (300) square feet per parking space. For example, one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet of gross floor area, divided by three hundred (300) square feet, equals four (4) parking spaces that must be provided. 
4.  Occupancy- or Capacity-Based Standards. For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents, or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment, or the maximum building code capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces. 
5.  Unlisted Uses. In reviewing a development application for a use not specifically listed, the City Manager or designee, shall apply the standard for the use that is most similar to the proposed use. 
E.  Off-Street Vehicle Parking Ratios and Design. 
1.  Amount of Off-Street Vehicle Parking (Table 16-6-4.1). Table 16-6-4.1 below sets forth the minimum required number of off-street vehicle parking spaces.

b.  The total number of spaces provided for the physically disabled shall be included in the total number of parking spaces otherwise required by this Title. 
G.  Adjustments to Required Parking. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16-6-4.F.1 EMC, "Amount of Off-Street Vehicle Parking," the following adjustments to the amount of off-street parking are allowed: 
1.  Parking Adjustments for Uses in the MU-B-1 Business District. 
a.  Exempt Areas. 
(1)  MU-B-1 Business District. Principal nonresidential uses located on properties with frontage on South Broadway, and located within the MU-B-1 district, are exempt from providing off-street parking spaces as stated in this Section 16-6-4 EMC. However, if off-street parking exists on, or is provided after, the effective date of this Title, such off-street parking shall comply with all applicable standards in this Section, except for the minimum amount required by subsection 16-6-4.F.1 EMC. 
b.  Waiver of Other Requirements. The City may waive the off-street parking requirements in this Section if an applicant submits a supporting marketing or parking study prepared by a qualified professional approved by the City, which applies reasonable professional standards, and the City Manager or designee approves such study. 
2.  Structured Parking Preferred. In order to conserve land for preferred development patterns in the MU-B-1 and TSA zone districts, the City strongly encourages developers to provide required off-street parking in multi-level structures to the maximum extent practicable. If structured parking is not feasible, surface parking areas shall be screened from the view of pedestrian ways by means of decorative walls or fences, landscaped berms, or mature shrubbery. See Section 16-6-7 EMC, for general landscaping and screening requirements. 
H.  Alternative Parking Plans. 
1.  Scope. An alternative parking plan is a proposal to meet vehicle parking needs by means other than providing parking according to the ratios established in Table 16-6-4.1 above, or by providing an alternative to this Section's off-street parking area design standards. Alternative parking plans may not be used to reduce required setbacks, landscaping, or screening of off-street parking areas. 
2.  Applicability. Applicants who are not otherwise eligible for the parking adjustments in subsection 16-6-4.H EMC, and seek to: (1) provide fewer off-street parking spaces than required in Table 16-6-4.1 EMC; (2) provide parking off-site; or (3) modify this Section's otherwise applicable off-street parking design standards shall secure approval of an alternative parking plan according to the standards of this subsection. 
3.  Contents. Alternative parking plans shall be submitted in a form established by the City. At a minimum, such plans shall detail the type of alternative proposed and the rationale behind the proposal. 
4.  Review and Approval Procedure. 
a.  Decision-Making Body. The City Manager or designee, with advice from the City Traffic Engineer or Transportation Planner, may approve, approve with conditions, or deny alternative parking plans. 
b.  Review Criteria. In order to approve an alternative parking plan, the City Manager or designee must determine that the proposed plan shall protect surrounding neighborhoods, maintain traffic circulation patterns, and promote quality urban design equally as well as or better than a plan that strictly complies with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. 
5.  Violations and Lapse. 
a.  Any modification or waiver of off-street parking approved under an alternative parking plan shall remain valid only as long as the conditions warranting the modification or waiver exist. If the conditions that warranted the modification or waiver cease to exist (e.g., the use changes in nature or extent, operation of the use is discontinued for twelve (12) months or more, or there is a substantial change in parking demand), the City shall send written notice to the applicant or owner that the plan approval shall automatically lapse and be null and void unless the applicant or owner can show cause why the plan approval should continue. The applicant or owner shall respond to the notice within thirty (30) days from the date of the notification, and shall appear and state their case to the City Manager or designee within ninety (90) days of the notification date. 
b.  Lapse of an alternative parking plan shall not preclude other remedies and enforcement actions available under this Title. Specifically, violations of an approved alternative parking plan are violations of this Title and subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of Chapter 16-10 EMC. 
6.  Eligible Alternatives/Criteria for Approval. A number of specific parking and access alternatives are described in the following subsections 6(a) through 6(e) below. The City may, however, consider and approve any alternative to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed plan meets the criteria stated in Section 16-6-4.I.4(B) EMC. 
a.  Shared Parking. It is the City's stated intention to encourage efficient use of land and resources by allowing users to share off-street parking facilities whenever feasible. The City Manager or designee may authorize a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for multiple use developments or for uses that are located near one another and that have different peak parking demands or different operating hours. Shared parking shall be subject to the following standards: 
(1)  Zoning Classification. Shared parking areas shall be considered accessory to the principal uses that the parking spaces are intended to serve. Shared parking areas shall require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the most intensive of the uses served by the shared parking area, provided that shared parking facilities may be located in any zoning district that allows commercial parking lots or structures. 
(2)  Required Study and Analysis. The applicant shall submit a shared parking analysis to the City that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study shall address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that shall be sharing off-street parking spaces. 
(3)  Shared Parking Agreement. A shared parking plan shall be enforced through written agreement among the owners of record. All shared parking agreements shall be approved by the City and thereafter recorded. A shared parking agreement may be revoked by the parties to the agreement only if off-street parking is provided under Table 16-6-4.1 of this Section or another alternative parking plan is approved. 
b.  Remote Parking. The City may permit all or a portion of required off-street parking to be located beyond the otherwise applicable distance requirements established in this Section, subject to the following standards: 
(1)  Location. No remote parking space shall be located more than three hundred feet (300') beyond the distance established in Section 16-6-4.F.2 EMC. The City may waive this distance limitation if adequate assurances are offered that van or shuttle service shall be operated between the remote lot and the principal use. 
(2)  Zoning Classification. Remote parking areas shall be considered accessory to the principal use that the parking spaces are intended to serve. Parking areas shall require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the most intensive of the uses served by the remote parking area, provided that remote parking facilities may be located in any zoning district that allows commercial parking lots or structures. 
(3)  Remote Parking Agreement. If a remote parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement among the owners of record shall be required. All remote parking agreements shall be approved by the City and thereafter recorded. A remote parking agreement may be revoked by the parties to the agreement only if off-street parking is provided under Table 16-6-4.1, or if another alternative parking plan is approved. 
c.  Parking Assessment Districts. When the City has established off-street parking facilities by special assessment district, all or a portion of the off-street parking spaces required by Table 16-6-4.1 may be waived when the subject building or use is located within the boundaries of the special assessment district, or other district that City may determine. The City Manager or designee, with the assistance of the City Traffic Engineer or Transportation Planner, shall determine to what extent and on which lots the required parking may be waived. In no event shall the total number of such waived parking spaces exceed the total number provided by the publicly owned parking facility. 
d.  Valet Parking. The City Manager or designee may authorize valet parking as a means of satisfying some or all of otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. 
e.  Transportation Demand Management Plan. The City may authorize a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for large developments or uses (those otherwise required to provide more than two hundred fifty (250) parking spaces) that institute and commit to maintain a transportation demand management (TDM) program, according to the following standards: 
(1)  Required Study. The applicant shall submit a study to the City clearly indicating the types of transportation demand management activities and measures proposed. The study shall be provided in a form established by the City. 
(2)  Transportation Management Activities. There shall be no limitation on the types of transportation management activities for which reductions may be granted from otherwise required off-street parking ratios. The following measures shall serve only as a guide to eligible transportation management activities: 
(a)  Posting and Distribution of Information. The distribution and posting of information from transit agencies and other sources of alternative transportation may, in combination with other TDM measures, be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(b)  Transportation Coordinator. The appointment of a transportation coordinator with responsibility for disseminating information on ride-sharing and other transportation options may, in combination with other TDM measures, be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. In addition to acting as liaisons, transportation coordinators shall be available to attend meetings and training sessions with the City or transit providers. 
(c)  Off-Peak Work Hours. Employers that institute off-peak work schedules, allowing employees to arrive at times other than the peak morning commute period, may be eligible for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. The peak morning commute period is defined as seven-thirty o'clock (7:30) A.M. to nine o'clock (9:00) A.M. 
(d)  Telecommuting. Employers that adopt a specific telecommuting policy for employees may be eligible for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(e)  Van and Car Pools. Provision of regular, employer-sponsored ride-sharing measures, such as van and car pools, may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(f)  Transit Head Facilities. Provision for convenient employee connections to transit head facilities (e.g., bus transfer stations or park and ride lots) may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(g)  Preferential Parking. The provision of specially marked spaces for each registered car pool and van pool may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(h)  Additional Bike Parking/Amenities. The provision of bicycle parking in an amount substantially greater than otherwise required by this Title and/or the provision of showering and changing facilities for bicycle-commuting employees may because for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(i)  Financial Incentives. The provision of cash or in-kind financial incentives for employees commuting by car pool, van pool, and transit may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable parking requirements. 
(3)  Reporting Required. Any development or use that institutes a TDM program and receives a reduction of off-street parking spaces under this subsection shall submit a written status report to the City at the end of each calendar year. The report shall provide tracking and other information that substantiates implementation of the TDM program and consistent or growing use of the program's measures by employees. 
I.  Vehicle Stacking Areas and Design Standards for Auto-Oriented Uses. The development and design standards of this subsection shall apply to all drive-in and drive-through facilities and other auto-oriented uses unless otherwise expressly approved by the City:

6.  It is recognized that because of the wide variety of types of developments and configurations associated with them, the City may grant minor deviations whenever such deviations are more likely to satisfy the intent of this section. 
H.  Alternative Methods of Compliance. 
1.  Purpose. It is recognized that because of the wide variety of development configurations, the City Manager or designee may on a case-by-case basis consider minor deviations to this Subsection whenever such deviations are more likely to satisfy the intent of these regulations. Alternative compliance is a process that allows modifications to existing regulations due to unique site conditions. In cases where the percentage of required landscaping or compliance with other standards may not be practical or feasible, the applicant may submit an alternative compliance landscape plan. 
2.  Alternative Compliance Landscape Plan Criteria. The City Manager or designee may review and approve the proposed plan if the alternative is consistent with the general intent and purpose of this Section. The proposed alternative compliance plan shall include information that substantiates the reasons for the requested modification. In addition, the City may approve the alternative compliance plan if it determines the proposed plan will more adequately comply with the intent of this section, or if it determines that one of the following conditions exist regarding the subject property: 
a.  The strict application of these standards is not possible due to unique site conditions such as location of structures, configuration of the lot, topography, existing landscaping; or 
b.  Safety considerations are involved such as site distance, pedestrian circulation; or 
c.  The property has space limitations that exist as a result of the location of existing structures, paved areas, and other built features. 
3.  Fee-In-Lieu. 
a.  Applicability. Fee-in-lieu shall apply only to development, redevelopment, renovation, remodel, or expansion in the following zone districts and/or to the following uses: MU-B-1, MU-B-2, I-1, I-2, commercial and more than four (4) multi-unit dwellings uses in the M-1, M-2, M-O-2, zone districts and nonresidential uses in the MU-R-3-A and MU-R-3-B zone districts. Within these zone districts, fee-in-lieu shall not be eligible for: 
(1)  Landscape requirements for Off-street Parking Lots or Screening between Uses or Districts. 
(2)  Landscape requirements between the principle structure and curb. 
(3)  The Street Perimeter Buffer in industrial zone districts. 
b.  Amount of Fee-In-Lieu/Accounting. Only after it has been determined by the City that an alternative compliance plan is not practical or feasible, a fee-in-lieu equivalent may be considered. The fee-in-lieu shall be based on a fee amount set by Council and calculated based on the square footage shortfall of the total required landscaped area. The fee shall be paid to the City and an accounting shall be made for landscaping and beautification of areas as determined by the City.

16-6-8: - Storm Water Drainage and Erosion/Siltation Control. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  General Applicability to All Development. All subdivision plats, Planned Unit Developments, or any other proposed construction submitted for approval shall include adequate drainage system design. Plans, engineering analysis and calculations, diagrams, drainage reports and other data shall be submitted, as required by the City Manager or designee with each development proposal or application for permit. 
2.  Applicability to Development in a Special Flood Hazard Area. Proposed development or improvements in a special flood hazard area shall meet the requirements of Chapter 16-4 EMC - (Floodplain Regulations). The flood hazard study shall be in the form of a final drainage report and shall include all such computations necessary to show that the requirements of Chapter 16-4 EMC - (Floodplain Regulations) are met. 
B.  Storm Water Discharge for Construction and Other Land Disturbing Activities. 
1.  The Federal Clean Water Act requires that storm water discharges be authorized under storm water discharge permits. A general permit issued by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment, Water Quality Control Division, covers storm water discharges from the City of Englewood. Construction site storm water runoff control is one of the minimum measures that Englewood must address in order to be in conformance with the Colorado Discharge Permit System, or CDPS, under Regulation 61. 
2.  A storm water management plan (SWMP) for the site must be developed and submitted to the City to obtain a construction or site-grading permit. This plan will identify the site-specific control measures necessary to prevent and control soil erosion, sedimentation, and water pollution that may degrade receiving waters downstream. 
3.  In addition to the minimum requirements stipulated in EPA Storm Water Phase II, the City has instituted the following requirement: Site disturbances that require the removal of existing vegetation from any property that will cause areas of soil to be exposed for more than sixty (60) days are not permitted unless an SWMP is approved by the City. All SWMPs shall comply with applicable standards adopted by the City of Englewood. 
C.  Restoration of Disturbed Areas. Disturbed areas shall be restored as natural-appearing landforms, with curves that blend in with adjacent undisturbed slopes. Abrupt angular transitions and linear slopes shall be avoided. As necessary, cuts and fills shall be supported by retaining walls made of masonry or stone materials. Areas disturbed by grading shall be contoured so they can be re-vegetated and shall be re-vegetated within one growing season after construction. Topsoil shall be stockpiled and placed on disturbed areas. 
(Ord. 04-5; Ord. 8-13,  8) 
16-6-9: - Underground Utilities. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  General Rule. These standards shall apply to all new development, and to expansions of existing residential buildings as described in the following paragraph, unless inconsistent with more specific standards applicable to a particular type of development. 
2.  Applicability to Expansions of Residential Buildings. These standards shall apply only to expansions, alterations, or enlargements of principal residential dwellings that increase the existing habitable gross floor area of the dwelling by thirty-three percent (33%) or more. 
B.  General Requirements. All electric and communication utility lines and services, and all street lighting circuits, shall be installed underground in a manner consistent with all applicable utility specifications and adopted safety codes, except for: 
1.  Transformers, switching boxes, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, ducts and other facilities necessarily appurtenant to such underground and street lighting facilities, which may be placed above ground within a utility easement, or within a public right-of-way in a location approved by the City. 
2.  Facilities reasonably necessary to connect underground facilities to existing or permitted overhead or over-ground facilities. 
3.  Overhead electric transmission lines and distribution feeder lines over 110KV, and overhead communication long distance, trunk, and feeder lines. 
4.  Existing utility facilities and structures, which shall not be required to be removed or replaced. 
5.  Any utility facilities or structures approved for above ground location pursuant to Section 16-2-16 EMC, "Zoning Variances," because unusual circumstances would make undergrounding of utilities an unreasonable hardship. 
Property owners are encouraged to install appropriate location indicators or tracers with all utilities placed underground. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-6-10: - Design Standards and Guidelines. 
A.  General Purpose. This Section's design standards and guidelines are intended to assure quality new development in the City of Englewood that provides variety and visual interest in exterior building design, is compatible with existing and desirable built patterns and materials, provides human scale detailing at the street level, and contributes to pedestrian-oriented streetscapes. 
B.  Residential Design Standards. 
1.  General Purpose. These residential design standards and guidelines are intended to ensure that infill, redevelopment, and renovation within Englewood's residential neighborhoods respond to the established character and variations within each neighborhood by utilizing complementary building design, setbacks, and massing. 
2.  Applicability. 
a.  Applicable Zone Districts. These residential design standards shall apply in the following zone districts: 
(1)  R-1-A; 
(2)  R-1-B; 
(3)  R-1-C; 
(4)  R-2-A; 
(5)  R-2-B; 
(6)  MU-R-3-A; and 
(7)  MU-R-3-B. 
b.  Applicable Development. 
(1)  Within the zone districts listed in subsection 2(a) above, these residential design standards shall apply to development of a new residential dwelling, or to the substantial expansion or alteration of an existing residential dwelling. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection only, "substantial expansion or alteration" shall mean construction that is equal to or greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the principal dwelling's existing gross floor area (including attached garages, but not including detached garages), or five hundred (500) square feet, whichever is greater. 
3.  Review Process. These residential design standards shall be applied during the normal process for residential Site Improvement Plan review, as stated in Section 16-2-9 EMC. 
4.  Alternative Compliance. 
a.  Applicability and Criteria. At the applicant's request, the City Manager or designee may approve an alternative approach to compliance with all or part of this Section's residential design standards. Alternative compliance is intended to apply in unusual circumstances that might arise where an alternative approach would provide a result that is equal to or superior to that provided by an approach fully complying with the standards in this Section. Economic factors or considerations shall not be a basis for granting alternative compliance. The City Manager or designee may accept alternative compliance with the residential standards in this Section if: 
(1)  The configuration of the lot or other existing physical condition of the lot makes the application of these standards impractical; and/or 
(2)  The proposed alternative is consistent with the general purpose of these residential standards and accomplishes the intent of the subject design standard(s) equally well or better than an approach that fully complies with the standard(s). 
b.  Applicable Procedure. The City shall process a request for alternative compliance as an Administrative Adjustment according to the procedures stated in Section 16-2-17 EMC. However, instead of the review criteria for Administrative Adjustments stated in Section 16-2-17.F. EMC, the review criteria in subsection 4(a) above shall apply to all requests for alternative compliance with these residential design standards. 
5.  Front Lot Coverage. 
a.  Maximum Front Lot Coverage. 
(1)  Lots With Rear Alley Access. 
(a)  General Rule. The maximum front lot coverage shall be twenty-five percent (25%). The remainder of the front lot shall be landscaped according to the standards stated in Section 16-6-7 EMC. See Section 16-6-1.A EMC for rules of measurement regarding front lot coverage. 
(b)  Incentive for Front Porches. The maximum front lot coverage may be increased to thirty-five percent (35%) when the dwelling includes a front porch that meets the following criteria: 
(1)  The front porch is covered but not enclosed; and 
(2)  The front porch has a minimum gross area of sixty (60) square feet, and a minimum dimension of five feet (5'). 
(2)  Lots Without Rear Alley Access. The maximum front lot coverage shall be forty-five percent (45%). The remainder of the front lot shall be landscaped according to the standards stated in Section 16-6-7 EMC. 
6.  Residential Garage Placement and Design. 
a.  Intent. Locating the garage to the rear or side of the home, as is typical in many parts of the City's residential districts, allows the architectural details of the home and front yard to define the character of the street. Recent residential development has introduced designs where garages, and often driveways, dominate the public street. To protect the established character in many residential neighborhoods, garage placement and scale should be carefully considered to minimize visual impacts upon the street and surrounding development. 
b.  Garage Placement and Design-Garages on Front Building Facade. 
(1)  Applicability. This subsection shall apply to garages that are attached to the front facade of the principal dwelling structure. 
(2)  Maximum Length of Garage Door as Percentage of Total Facade Length. Street-facing garage doors shall not comprise more than the following percentage of the total length of the front facade of the principal dwelling structure: 
Lot Width Maximum Total Cumulative Width of Street- 
Facing Garage Doors as % of Front Building 
Facade Length Less than or equal to 50 Feet 40% More than 50 Feet 45%  
For purposes of this provision, the width of the street-facing garage door(s) shall be measured as the linear distance between the outer edges of the door(s), including any support or wall area between two (2) or more garage doors that is less than three feet (3') wide. Where two (2) or more street-facing garage doors are located on the front facade of the building, but are separated by more than three feet (3') of support or wall area, the width of each garage door, not including the separating wall area, shall be added together to determine the numerator for this formula. 

Commentary to Figure 16-6(12) [above]: This figure illustrates an acceptable attached garage design for the front facade of a one-unit dwelling, wherein the width of the garage door, measured edge to edge, does not exceed forty percent (40%) or forty-five percent (45%) of the entire length of the building's front facade. 
(3)  Design Standards for Side-Loaded Garages. Side-loaded garages shall have architectural details or windows on the sidewall of the garage facing the street that are consistent with the features of the living portion of the dwelling. 

Commentary to Figure 16-6(13) [above]: This figure illustrates an acceptable design and level of detail for the street-facing side wall of an attached side-loaded garage. 
(4)  Guidelines for Garages on Corner Lots. It is strongly encouraged that one-unit dwellings on corner lots be built with garages (either attached or detached) that are accessed from the alley or the longer side lot line. 
7.  Articulation of Street-Facing Building Facades. 
a.  Intent. This subsection's standards are intended to provide variety and visual interest in the exterior design and massing of residential buildings, and to respect prevalent neighborhood design patterns that generally provide a rich variety of approaches to articulating building planes. Tall, boxy forms should be avoided, as should long expanses of blank wall visible from public ways. 
b.  Applicability. This subsection's articulation standards shall apply to all dwelling types subject to these residential standards, and specifically only to such dwellings' elevations that face a public street, but not including elevations that face only a public alley. 
c.  Articulation of Wall Surface Required. All building elevations that face a public street shall employ varied articulation of wall surfaces, when such surfaces exceed twenty-five feet (25') in length (including any attached garages). For every twenty-five (25) linear feet, wall surfaces shall be articulated through use of three (3) or more of the following techniques: 
(1)  A change in texture or material, provided all exterior wall textures and material are consistent with the overall architectural style of the dwelling; 
(2)  Use of offsets, reveals, insets, bays, or other similar architectural features; 
(3)  Use of balconies, overhangs, or covered patios; 
(4)  Variations in rooflines, such as a gable or dormer; 
(5)  Window placement, provided windows are similar in size, shape, and orientation as those found on most of the dwellings on the same block; 
(6)  Use of exterior trim; or 
(7)  Incorporation of stoops or front porches related to entrances. 

Commentary to Figure 16-6(14) [above]: The house to the left in this figure incorporated a level of street-facing building facade articulation that complies with the standard of Section 16-6-10.B.7(c), while the house on the right presents an unacceptable, unarticulated facade to the street that does not comply with the standard. 

Commentary to Figure 16-6(15) [above]: This figure illustrates how a house design that at first does not comply with the street-facing facade articulation standard in Section 16-6-10.B.7(c) above, can be redesigned to comply with the standard without significantly changing the basic layout, size, or massing of the house. 
C.  Special Building and Site Design Standards Applicable in the MU-R-3 Zone Districts. 
1.  New high-density residential and office projects should be sensitive to the character of adjacent development. The siting of vertical structures should respect the topographic features of the land. 
2.  High-density residential and office development should be located on land parcels of sufficient size to ensure proper site design and identity and to warrant the installation of desirable amenities. 
3.  Where possible, the view of the mountains should be preserved and buildings oriented in such a way as to maximize the occupant views of the mountains. 
D.  Reserved. 
E.  Design Standards and Guidelines for Large Retail Buildings. 
1.  Purpose. This Section is intended to set standards for retail development with community-wide or regional impacts to ensure that the proposed development fits with the expectations and needs of the community, and to encourage retail development that contributes to Englewood as a unique place by reflecting and adding appropriately to its physical character. These standards and guidelines require a basic level of architectural variety, compatible scale, pedestrian, and bicycle access, and mitigation of negative impacts. The standards are by no means intended to limit creativity; it is the City's hope that they will serve as a useful tool for design professionals engaged in site-specific design in context with surrounding environment. 
2.  Application and Procedure. 
a.  These standards and guidelines apply to all new projects that include development of one (1) or more large retail buildings, as defined in Chapter 16-11 EMC, as a use-by-right or within a Planned Unit Development without equal or more stringent retail design standards and guidelines. "Standards" are mandatory. "Guidelines" are not mandatory, but are provided in order to educate planners, design consultants, developers, and City staff about the design objectives described herein. The standards and guidelines are intended to be used as a design aid by developers proposing large retail buildings in use-by-right zone districts or in Planned Unit Development zone districts that may be proposing retail development without appropriate design standards. This Section is also intended to be used as an evaluation tool by the City in the review processes. 
b.  The City is empowered to grant exceptions to the mandatory standards under the following circumstances: 
(1)  The strict application of the standard would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of the affected property; or 
(2)  The alternative site planning and building design approach meets the design objectives as stated in the standard, equally well or better than would compliance with the standard; and 
(3)  In either of the forgoing circumstances, the exceptions may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good. 
3.  Aesthetic Character. 
a.  Facades and Exterior Walls. 
(1)  Guideline. Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual interest that will be consistent with the community's identity, character, and scale. The intent is to encourage a more human scale that Englewood residents will be able to identify with their community. 
(2)  Standard. 
(a)  Facades greater than seventy-five feet (75') in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least three percent (3%) of the length of the facade and extending at least twenty percent (20%) of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed seventy-five (75) horizontal feet. 
(b)  Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along no less than forty percent (40%) of their horizontal length. 
b.  Smaller Retail Stores. 
(1)  Guideline. The presence of smaller retail stores gives a large building a "friendlier" appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and expanding the range of the site's activities. Windows and window displays of such stores should be used to contribute to the visual interest of exterior facades. The standards presented in this Section are directed toward those situations where additional, smaller stores, with separate, exterior customer entrances are located in large retail buildings. 
(2)  Standard. Where principal large retail buildings contain additional, separately owned stores that occupy less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances: 
(a)  The street level facade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of three feet (3') and eight feet (8') above the walkway grade for no less than sixty percent (60%) of the horizontal length of the building facade of such additional stores. 
(b)  Windows shall be recessed or be extended and should include visually prominent sills, bays, or other such forms of framing. 
c.  Detail Features. 
(1)  Guidelines. Large retail buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce massive aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. The elements in the following standard should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint. 
(2)  Standard. Building facades shall include a repeating pattern that shall include at least three (3) of the elements listed below. At least one (1) of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than thirty feet (30'), either horizontally or vertically. 
(a)  Color change; 
(b)  Texture change; 
(c)  Material module change; 
(d)  Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less than twelve inches (12") in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib. 
d.  Roofs. 
(1)  Guideline. Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large retail buildings. Roof features should complement the character of adjoining neighborhoods. 
(2)  Standard. Roofs shall have one (1) of the following features as appropriate to roof type: 
(a)  Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment such as HVAC units from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the height of the supporting wall and such parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third ( 1/3 ) of the height of the supporting wall. Such parapets shall feature three-dimensional (3-D) cornice treatment. HVAC equipment shall be concealed from public view through the use of parapets or other similar screening devices. HVAC equipment shall be painted to blend with the roof color. 
(b)  Overhanging eaves, extending no less than three feet (3') past the supporting walls. 
(c)  Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the supporting walls, with an average slope greater than or equal to one foot (1') of vertical rise for every three feet (3') of horizontal run and less than or equal to one foot (1') of vertical rise for every one foot (1') of horizontal run. 
(d)  Three (3) or more roof slope planes. 
e.  Materials and Colors. 
(1)  Guideline. Exterior building materials and colors comprise a significant part of the visual impact of a large retail building. Therefore, they should be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and colors used in adjoining neighborhoods. 
(2)  Standard. 
(a)  Predominant exterior building materials shall be high-quality materials. These include: 
(1)  Brick 
(2)  Sandstone 
(3)  Stucco 
(4)  Other native stone 
(5)  Tinted, textured, concrete masonry units 
(b)  Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth tone colors. The use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors is prohibited. 
(c)  Roof materials shall be of high-quality materials. These include, without limitation: 
(1)  Metal 
(2)  Concrete 
(3)  Tile 
(d)  Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors. 
(e)  Predominant exterior building materials shall not include prefabricated steel panels. 
f.  Entryways. 
(1)  Guidelines. Entryway design elements and variations should give orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the large retail building. The standards identify desirable entryway design features. 
(2)  Standard. Each principal large retail building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less than three (3) of the following: 
(a)  Canopies or porticos 
(b)  Overhangs 
(c)  Recesses/projections 
(d)  Arcades 
(e)  Raised corniced parapets over the door 
(f)  Peaked roof forms 
(g)  Arches 
(h)  Outdoor patios 
(i)  Display windows 
(j)  Architectural details such as tile work and moldings that are integrated into the building structure and design 
(k)  Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting 
Where additional stores will be located in the principal large retail building, each such store shall have at least one (1) exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above requirements. 
g.  Back and Side Facades. 
1.  Guideline. All facades of a large retail building that are visible from adjoining properties and/or public streets should contribute to the pleasing scale features of the building and encourage community integration by featuring characteristics similar to the front facade. 
2.  Standard. All large retail building facades that are visible from adjoining properties, light rail and/or public streets shall comply with the requirements of facades and exterior walls section of these design standards and guidelines. 
4.  Site Design and Relationship to the Surrounding Community. 
a.  Back and Sides. 
(1)  Guideline. The rear or sides of large retail buildings often present an unattractive view of blank walls, loading areas, storage areas, HVAC units, garbage receptacles, and other such features. Architectural and landscaping features should mitigate these impacts. 
(2)  Standard. The City may allow the placement of screening walls closer to the street than the minimum required building setback, provided the building facade is in compliance with standards set forth within the "Facades and Exterior Walls" standards in subsection 3(a) above. 
b.  Outdoor Storage, Trash Collection, and Loading Areas. 
(1)  Guideline. Loading areas and outdoor storage areas exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. These areas, when visible from adjoining properties and/or public streets, should be screened, recessed, or enclosed. While screens and recesses can effectively mitigate these impacts, the selection of inappropriate screening materials can exacerbate the problem. Appropriate locations for loading and outdoor storage areas include areas between buildings, where more than one (1) building is located on a site and such buildings are not more than forty feet (40') apart, or on those sides of buildings that do not have customer entrances. 
(2)  Standard. 
(a)  Areas for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or compaction, loading, or other such uses shall be screened from abutting streets. 
(b)  Loading docks, truck parking, outdoor storage, utility meters, HVAC equipment, trash collection, trash compaction, and other service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the large retail building and the screening or landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets, and no attention is attracted to the functions by the use of screening materials that are different from or inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape. 
(c)  Non-enclosed areas for the storage and sale of any inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences. Materials, colors, and design of screening walls and/or fences and the cover shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the large retail building. If such areas are to be covered, then the covering shall conform to those used as predominant materials and colors on the building. 
c.  Delivery/Loading Operations. 
(1)  Guideline. Delivery and loading operations should not disturb adjoining neighborhoods, or other uses. 
(2)  Standard. No delivery, loading, trash removal or compaction, parking area cleaning, or other such similar operations shall be permitted between the hours of eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M. and seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. unless the applicant submits evidence that sound barriers between all areas for such operations effectively reduce noise emissions to a level of forty-five (45) decibels, as measured at the lot line of any adjoining property. 
d.  Pedestrian Flows. 
(1)  Guideline. Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the neighborhood, thereby reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This Section sets forth standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation systems that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian safety, shelter, and convenience within a development that includes a large retail building. 
(2)  Standard. 
(a)  Sidewalks at least six feet (6') in width shall be provided along all sides of the lot that abut a public street. 
(b)  Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than six feet (6') in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry points, and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees, shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers, or other such materials for no less than fifty percent (50%) of its length. 
(c)  Sidewalks, no less than six feet (6') in width, shall be provided along the full length of the building along any facade featuring a customer entrance, and along any facade abutting public parking areas. 
(d)  Internal pedestrian walkways provided in conformance with subsection 2(b) above shall provide weather protection features such as awnings or arcades within thirty feet (30') of all customer entrances. 
(e)  All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways. 
e.  Central Features and Community Spaces. 
(1)  Guideline. Buildings should offer attractive and inviting pedestrian scale features, spaces, and amenities. Entrances and parking lots should be configured to be functional and inviting with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be considered as integral parts of the configuration. Pedestrian ways should be anchored by special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, pedestrian light fixtures, bollards, planter walls, and other architectural elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces. Examples of outdoor spaces are plazas, patios, courtyards, and window shopping areas. The features and spaces should enhance the building and the center as integral parts of the community fabric. 
(2)  Standard. Each development subject to these standards shall contribute to the establishment or enhancement of community and public spaces by providing at least two (2) of the following: 
(a)  Patio/seating area, 
(b)  Pedestrian plaza with benches, 
(c)  Transportation center, 
(d)  Window shopping walkway, 
(e)  Outdoor playground area, 
(f)  Kiosk area, 
(g)  Clock tower, 
(h)  Water feature, 
(i)  Public art, or 
(j)  Other such deliberately shaped area and/or a focal feature or amenity that adequately enhances such community and public spaces. 
Any such areas shall have direct access to the public sidewalk network and such features shall be constructed of materials that are similar in durability to the principal materials of the building and landscaping.

The supporting structure or bracing of a sign shall be omitted from measurement, unless such structure or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign. 
(1)  Sign Area Computation. The area of all signs shall be computed by use of standard mathematical methods. An unlimited number of lines may be used to enclose the extreme limits of the sign, including all frames, backing, face plates, non-structural trim or other component parts not otherwise used for support. 
(2)  Sign with Backing/Background. The area measurement of a sign that is enclosed by a box, framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for the sign display shall be determined by the area of the entire sign including the background material. 
(3)  Signs without Backing. The area of signs comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements shall be determined by the sum of the area of each separate element and shall include all the display areas, including the open space between the elements. 
(4)  Three-Dimensional (3-D) Signs and Devices. The area of three-dimensional, spherical, free form, sculptural and/or other nonplanar signs or advertising devices, shall be determined by multiplying the length times width of the object's largest profile. The measurements shall be taken with the object at full extension. 
(5)  Sign Faces. A sign face is the display surface available for displaying a message. The number of sign faces used to calculate the area of a sign shall be determined by Table 16-6-13.2 EMC - (Sign Face Computations to Determine Sign Area).

1 Provided the separation between faces is no greater than eighteen inches (18") and no sign is displayed on the separation surface. 
2 Back-to-back signs shall be regarded as a single sign only if mounted on a single structure, and the distance between each sign face does not exceed eighteen inches (18") and no sign is displayed on the separation surface.  
b.  Sign Height. 
(1)  Ground Signs. The height of a ground sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from the normal grade at the base of the sign or its support structure, whichever is lower, and the topmost portion of the sign or the structure supporting the sign, whichever is higher. 
Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction; or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. 
In cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street. 
(2)  Projecting and Marquee Signs. The height of projecting and marquee signs shall be computed as the vertical distance from the lowest grade below the sign or its support structure, whichever is lower, and the topmost portion of the sign or the structure supporting the sign. 
c.  Sign Clearance. Clearance for all signs shall be measured as the vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments. 
d.  Projections. Wall and projecting signs shall be measured from the building facade to the farthest aspect of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments. 
e.  Measurement of Street Frontage. For the purposes of this Section street frontage is the length of the public street abutting the parcel on which the sign is located. For the purposes of determining allowable sign area the following shall apply: 
(1)  An alley shall not be used to calculate street frontage. 
(2)  A City-approved private street may be used to calculate street frontage. 
(3)  For corner lots, the frontage of all streets shall be cumulative. 
f.  Measurement of Building Frontage. For the purposes of determining allowable sign area the following shall apply: 
(1)  The frontage of a building shall include only the elevation(s) facing a public street. 
(a)  If a building has more than one (1) elevation facing a public street, the cumulative building frontages shall be used to determine the maximum sign area. 
(b)  An alley shall not be used to calculate building frontage. 
(c)  A City-approved private street may be used to calculate building frontage. 
(2)  Building frontage is determined by measuring a straight line, paralleling the street-facing elevation, between the two (2) most distant ends of the building. 
(3)  In the case of an irregular elevation surface, a single straight line approximating such elevation shall be used to measure the elevation's length. 
(4)  Building frontage used as the basis of determining allowed sign area for one use may not be used again as the basis for determining the permitted sign area for another use. 
(5)  Multi-Tenant Buildings. The portion of a building that is owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit. The building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party walls defining the building unit. 
g.  Final Determination and Appeals. Final determination of measurements and computations for signs and advertising devices shall be made by the City Manager or designee. Appeals shall be made to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
[Editor's Note: Requirements for the South Broadway Sign Area have been merged into the overall Sign Code.]

D.  Prohibited Uses in the TSA District. Drive-in or drive-through uses, either as a principal use or as an accessory use, are prohibited in the TSA district. 
E.  Mix of Principal Uses Required. 
1.  Use Categories. For purposes of this subsection, each principal use allowed in the TSA district by Section 16-5-1 EMC, "Table of Allowed Uses," is grouped into one of the following five (5) general use categories: 
a.  Residential uses; 
b.  Commercial uses (other than limited offices); 
c.  Commercial limited office uses; 
d.  Light industrial uses; and 
e.  Public/institutional/transportation uses. 
2.  Applicability/Plan Requirement. A mix of land uses shall be required on any development site in the TSA district that is three (3) acres in gross land area or larger, and shall be depicted in the application for a Site Improvement Plan Review. 
3.  Required Mix and Proportion of Land Uses. 
a.  The Site Improvement Plan for the site shall include at least two (2) of the five (5) use categories listed in subsection E.1 above. 
b.  No one use category listed in subsection E.1 shall comprise more than ninety percent (90%) of the Site Improvement Plan's net land area. "Net land area" for purposes of this provision means gross land area less dedicated public rights-of-way. 
c.  All residential development provided as part of the required mix shall be provided at the minimum density required in subsection F. below. 
d.  Subsequent Site Improvement Plans may include only one principal use, provided the applicant shall give assurances to the City's satisfaction, including but not limited to restrictive covenants, that subsequent phases of the development will include a mix of uses according to the approved Site Improvement Plan. 
F.  Minimum Residential Density. 
1.  Applicability. The minimum density requirement stated in this subsection shall apply to all new residential development in the TSA district, except for expansions of a nonconforming residential structure allowed by Chapter 16-9 EMC - (Nonconformities). 
2.  Minimum Residential Density. Thirty (30) dwelling units per acre, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Station Area Standards and Guidelines. 
3.  Calculation of Residential Density. Residential density in the TSA district shall be measured as the total number of dwelling units divided by the gross land area of the total development parcel shown in a Site Improvement Plan. 
G.  Requirement for First Floor Active Uses Adjacent to Light Rail Station. 
1.  Applicability. This subsection shall apply to the block frontages immediately adjacent to a RTD light rail passenger loading station (including adjacent public open space such as plazas), which is at least partially intended for development of retail or other commercial uses to serve light rail commuters. 
2.  First Floor Active Uses Required. The first floor of all buildings, except transit station buildings and parking structures, developed within the applicable area described above shall comply with the following standard: 
a.  The first (ground-level) floor shall be constructed to permit future occupancy by any of following principal uses: 
(1)  Live/work dwellings, provided the commercial activity in the dwelling is located primarily on the ground floor and the primary entrance to the commercial activity is oriented toward the light rail station or adjacent public plaza/open area. 
(2)  Commercial uses, except for parking and/or commercial storage of operable vehicles. 
(3)  Public/institutional uses, except for religious assemblies and educational institutions of any type other than trade or business schools for adults that operate on a year-round basis and offer day, evening, and weekend classes. 
b.  While the City encourages immediate occupancy by the active uses listed in subsection (a) above, immediate occupancy of the first floor upon completion of construction may be for any of the principal uses allowed in the TSA district, except parking and/or commercial storage of operable vehicles. The City may condition zoning approval upon the applicant's good faith and best efforts to provide active ground-floor uses consistent with this subsection within a reasonable time period. 
3.  Building Code Compliance Required. Typically, in order to meet the standard for active first floor uses in this subsection, first-floor construction will need to satisfy current building and fire code requirements for future occupancy by commercial uses, including eating and drinking establishments. An applicant shall meet with the City prior to submitting an application for Site Improvement Plan or other development planning approval, and again prior to submitting an application for the first building permit, to discuss and assure compliance with this subsection. 
H.  Building Setbacks and Build-To Lines. 
1.  Building Setbacks and Build-To Lines.

(2)  Maximum Front Setback-Applicability: 
(a)  The maximum front setback requirements of this subsection apply only to the lower thirty feet (30') or first two (2) stories, whichever is less, of a principal building, and higher portions of the building may be stepped back further from the lot line. 
(b)  The maximum setback standard shall not apply to a surface parking facility that is the principal use of a site. 
(3)  Maximum Front Setback: Fifteen feet (15'), measured from the front property line. To encourage pedestrian-friendly streets, the City encourages principal nonresidential buildings to be set back zero feet (0') from the back edge of the public sidewalk, except as necessary to allow room for outdoor seating and service areas, outdoor sales and displays, landscaping, and similar pedestrian and customer amenities. 
(4)  Side Setback-Principal Buildings and Uses: 
(a)  Minimum Side Setback: Zero feet (0'), except that where a side yard is provided from an interior lot line, the minimum shall be five feet (5').

Chapter 7 - TELECOMMUNICATIONS 

16-7-1: - Statement of Purpose and Intent. 
    In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, the Council finds that these regulations are necessary to: 
A.  Establish a local policy concerning telecommunications providers and services; 
B.  Promote competition in the provision of telecommunications services; 
C.  Minimize unnecessary local regulation of telecommunications providers and services; 
D.  Establish guidelines, standards and time frames for the exercise of local authority with respect to the regulation of telecommunications providers and services; 
E.  Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the residents and businesses of the City; 
F.  Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and siting standards; 
G.  Avoid potential personal injury and damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements; 
H.  Encourage and maximize the use of existing and approved towers, buildings and other structures to accommodate new wireless telecommunications antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community; 
I.  Assure that all telecommunications carriers providing facilities or services within the City comply with the Englewood Municipal Code. 
J.  Secure fair and reasonable compensation to the City and its residents for the use of any appropriate public property for use as a site for wireless telecommunications facilities; and 
K.  Enable the City to discharge its public trust consistent with rapidly evolving Federal and State regulatory policies, industry competition, and technological development. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-7-2: - Applicability. 
A.  General Applicability. Except as specifically provided below, these provisions shall apply throughout the city limits of the City of Englewood, and no tower, antenna or telecommunications facility shall be permitted except in compliance with these provisions. In case of any conflict between the requirements of this Section and any zoning district regulations, the provisions of this Section shall control. 
B.  Amateur Radio and Receive-Only Antennas. This Section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, owned and operated by a Federally licensed amateur radio station operator in accordance with FCC rules, or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas, so long as all other requirements of the zoning districts are met. 
C.  Pre-Existing Towers, Antennas, and Telecommunications Facilities. Any tower, antenna or telecommunications facility for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this Section shall not be required to meet the requirements of this Section, other than the requirements of Section 16-7-6.C through 16-7-6.H and Section 16-7-13 EMC. Any such towers, antennas or telecommunications facilities shall be referred to in this Section as pre-existing towers, pre-existing antennas, or pre-existing telecommunications facilities. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-7-3: - Application. 
    A building permit shall be required for all towers, antennas, and telecommunications facilities. All applicants for a building permit shall apply with the City on forms to be provided by the City, which shall include information and supporting site plans, technical reports, and materials as specified by the City. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-7-4: - Amendment. 
    Each applicant shall inform the City, within sixty (60) days, of any change of the information provided in the application. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-7-5: - Colocation Encouraged. 
    All applicants shall submit a narrative and map description of the applicant's existing or then current land use application for proposed telecommunications facilities within the City, and outside of the City within one thousand feet (1,000') of its boundaries. In addition, the applicant shall inform the City generally of the areas of the City in which it believes telecommunications facilities may need to be located within the next three (3) years. This provision is not intended to be a requirement that the applicant submit its business plan, proprietary information, or make commitments to the location of facilities in various parts of the City. Rather, it is an attempt to provide a mechanism for the City and all applicants for telecommunications facilities to share general information, assist in the City's Comprehensive Planning process, and promote colocation by identifying areas in which telecommunications facilities might be appropriately constructed for multiple users. The City shall maintain a list of telecommunications facilities and update the same from information furnished by all service providers. By submitting an application, all applicants acknowledge that the City may direct future applicants to discuss colocation with an applicant that has disclosed to the City the possibility of locating telecommunications facilities in a given area; provided however that the City is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-7-6: - General Guidelines and Requirements. 
A.  Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and other ancillary telecommunications facilities may be considered either principal or accessory uses. Towers, unless specifically accessory to the use of a property, shall be considered a principal use of property. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna on such lot. Where a new lot or leasehold parcel has been created from a larger parcel, for purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the larger lot from which the new lot was created shall control. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
B.  Aesthetics; Lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection B shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this Section. Where options for aesthetic treatment are provided, the City shall direct which option is to be utilized. 
1.  Towers either shall maintain a galvanized steel finish, or subject to any applicable FAA standards, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
2.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related telecommunication facilities shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the telecommunications facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
3.  The City may require all antenna(s) be appropriately screened to safeguard surrounding property provided that such screening will not interfere with the transmission and/or reception capabilities of any antenna located on the tower as required in subsection F. 
4.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting telecommunications facilities must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
5.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the City may review any available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. Lighting must be shielded or directed to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the amount of light that falls onto public rights-of-way or nearby properties, particularly residences. 
6.  No portion of any antenna array may extend beyond the property line. 
7.  Ancillary telecommunications facilities shall be no taller than the maximum height in the zoning district where the facilities are located and shall be compatible with the surrounding area. 
8.  Ancillary telecommunications facilities in areas of high visibility shall, where possible, be sited either below the ridgeline, amidst groups of trees, or designed (e.g., placed underground, depressed, or located behind earth berms or otherwise effectively screened) to minimize their profile. 
9.  As part of the conditional use application process, the City may require a special design of any telecommunications facility where findings of particular sensitivity are made. 
C.  Federal Requirements. All telecommunication facilities must meet or exceed the current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the Federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunication facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the telecommunication facilities governed by this Section shall bring such telecommunication facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the time frame mandated by the controlling Federal agency. Failure to bring telecommunication facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the telecommunication facilities at the owner's expense. 
D.  Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes; the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time; and all applicable codes adopted by the City. 
1.  In addition to any other applicable standards and requirements, the following shall apply to all towers and telecommunications facilities: 
a.  Sufficient anti-climbing measures must be incorporated into each facility to reduce potential for trespass and injury. By way of example, and not of limitation, security fencing pursuant to Section 16-7-10.F EMC, together with a lack of pegs on the bottom portion of the tower, shall be considered sufficient anti-climbing measures. 
b.  No guy wires employed may be anchored within the area in front of any primary structure on a parcel. 
c.  At least ten feet (10') of horizontal clearance must exist between any antenna and any power line, unless more clearance is required to meet Colorado Public Utilities Commission Standards. 
d.  All telecommunications facilities must be designed and/or sited so that they do not pose a potential hazard to nearby residences or surrounding properties or improvements. Any tower shall be designed and maintained to withstand, without failure, the maximum forces expected from wind, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other natural occurrences, when the tower is fully loaded with antennas, transmitters, and other telecommunications facilities, and camouflaging; or, in the case of pre-existing towers, when the tower is loaded with the antennas, transmitters, and/or other telecommunications facilities at the time of passage of this Section. Initial demonstration of compliance with this requirement shall be provided via submission of a report to the City prepared by a structural engineer, licensed in the State of Colorado, describing the tower structure, specifying the number and type of antennas it is designed to accommodate, providing the basis for the calculations done, and documenting the actual calculations performed. Proof of ongoing compliance shall be provided pursuant to any applicable codes. 
2.  If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a telecommunications facility fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of a telecommunications facility, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such telecommunications facility into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such telecommunications facility into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the City may remove such telecommunications facility at the owner's expense. 
E.  Radio Frequency Standards. All applicants shall comply with Federal standards for radio frequency emissions. At the time of permit application, the applicant shall submit a project implementation report that provides cumulative field predictions of radio frequency emissions of all antennas to be initially installed at the subject site, and which compares the results with established Federal standards. In response to any written complaint regarding radio frequency emissions, the operator of a telecommunications facility shall, within a reasonable period of time after receiving notice of the written complaint, submit a report to the City indicating whether all radio frequency emissions generated by that entity's telecommunications facilities are within Federal standards. If, in response to such written complaint, it is determined that the emissions from the facility are within allowable Federal standards, the entity providing the report shall not be required to make a similar response to further written complaint for a period of at least one (1) year from the date of the prior complaint. If the report indicates that emissions exceed Federal standards, the City may require corrective action within a reasonable period of time, and if not corrected, may require removal of the telecommunications facilities pursuant to Section 16-7-9 EMC. Any reasonable costs incurred by the City, including reasonable consulting costs to verify compliance with these requirements, shall be paid by the applicant. 
F.  Signal Interference. All towers, antennas and telecommunications facilities must be designed and/or sited so as not to cause interference with the normal operation of radio, television, telephone and other telecommunications services utilized by adjacent residential and nonresidential properties; nor shall any such facilities interfere with any public safety telecommunications. 
G.  Modification. Existing antennas on an approved telecommunications facility may be modified, and the power output of existing antennas on an approved facility may be increased, provided the standards and procedures outlined in ANSI Standard and C-95.1 or any amendments or revisions thereto, OST Bulletin No. 65 and Electronics Industries Associations EIA-RS 222(E) or the latest revision or amendment thereof; or such current standards as may be approved by the FCC are complied with. 
1.  The City shall be notified within fourteen (14) days of any change in or addition of antennas whose power output exceeds one hundred (100) watts E.R.P. of radio frequency power output. The City may request copies of plans depicting such modification and other evidence necessary to demonstrate that such modifications are in compliance with the provisions of this Section, and a permitted use approval. A subsequent field report, prepared by a qualified radio frequency engineer, quantifying a projects radio frequency emissions and exposures, and comparing them to adopted Federal standards, may be requested by the City upon project installation. 
2.  The City must be notified at least thirty (30) days prior to any modification which increases the wind or weight loading capacity, height or footprint of a tower, and may request copies of plans which depict such modifications and indicate compliance with the provisions of this Section, and with the permitted use approval. Depending upon the nature of the modifications, such modifications may require conditional use approval pursuant to Section 16-2-12 EMC. 
H.  Prohibited Use. Advertising or communication of any visual messages from a tower or antenna is prohibited, with the exception of safety related messages.

B.  A change in ownership or tenancy of a nonconforming use, structure, or lot shall not affect the ability of the new owners or tenants of the use, structure, or lot to continue to use such land or buildings in the same manner, and for the same uses, existing on the effective date of this Title, except as otherwise set forth in this Chapter 16-9 EMC. 
C.  The owner or occupant of a use that was existing on the effective date of this Title and was designated as a use by right prior to the adoption of this Title, but is designated as a conditional use or limited use under this Title, shall be deemed to have a valid conditional use or Limited Use Permit for such use, and the City shall issue written confirmation of such status upon request. 
D.  No use that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after the principal nonconforming use ceases to exist. 
E.  Repairs and normal maintenance required to keep nonconforming uses, structures, and signs in a safe condition shall be permitted. All repair and normal maintenance shall be subject to the limitations set forth below regarding expansion and enlargement of the structure, use, or sign.

If a nonconforming structure, or a portion of a structure devoted to a nonconforming use, becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to a lack of repairs and maintenance and it is declared by an authorized official, as designated by the City Manager or designee, to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall thereafter be restored, rebuilt, or repaired only in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(Ord. 04-5) 
16-9-2: - Nonconforming Uses. 
A.  Nonconforming Use of Building or Structure. 
1.  The nonconforming use of a building or structure may be continued, except as otherwise provided herein. 
2.  A nonconforming use in a Special Flood Hazard Area may be modified, altered, or repaired to incorporate floodproofing measures, but shall not be extended or expanded. 
3.  The nonconforming use shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use. 
4.  The nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use. 
5.  The nonconforming use shall not be extended or expanded. An "extension or expansion" shall include any increase in the floor area of the building or structure in which the nonconforming use is conducted or any expansion or relocation of the nonconforming use, in whole or in part, to a different part of the building or structure. 
6.  The permitted accessory uses to a nonconforming use shall be those existing on the effective date of this Title, and the initiation of additional accessory uses shall not be permitted after that date, except as follows: 
a.  A nonconforming residential use in any zone district shall be permitted to initiate a single home occupation, subject to all applicable standards stated in Section 16-5-4.C.1 EMC, "Home Occupations". 
b.  A nonconforming residential use shall be permitted to construct a residential garage or carport that otherwise complies with this Title. 
7.  A nonconforming multi-unit dwelling containing two (2) units shall be permitted to add a separate water and sewer line for each unit, and such addition shall not be deemed to constitute a change to a different nonconforming use or an extension or expansion of the existing nonconforming use. 
8.  If the nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or more, regardless of any intent to resume operations, any future use of the buildings or structure must be a conforming use. 
9.  If a conforming building or structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed or damaged to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of its value, as determined pursuant to the method of valuation of buildings for the issuance of a building permit, any future use of the rebuilt or restored building or structure shall be a conforming use. However, a legal nonconforming one-unit dwelling, on the effective date of this Title, located in a business or industrial zone district, may be rebuilt or reconstructed and used as a one-unit dwelling if a building permit for the dwelling unit is applied for within one (1) year after the destruction or damage occurred. Further, a legal nonconforming dwelling containing two (2) units, on the effective date of this Title, located in an R-1-A, R-1-B, or R-1-C residential zone district may be rebuilt or reconstructed and used as a two-unit dwelling if a building permit for a multi-unit dwelling containing two (2) units is applied for within one (1) year after the destruction or damage occurred. 
B.  Nonconforming Use of Land 
1.  Except as otherwise provided herein, a nonconforming use of land may be continued if no building is involved and if the nonconforming use is the principal use. 
2.  Such nonconforming use of land shall not be extended or expanded either on the same or adjoining properties. An "extension or expansion" shall include any increase in the area of land used for the nonconforming use, and any relocation of the nonconforming use, in whole or in part, to an area of land different from the area used on the date the use became nonconforming. 
3.  If the nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or more, regardless of any intent to resume operations, any future use of the land must conform to the requirements of this Title. Seasonal uses must be used each consecutive season, and missing a season will indicate abandonment of the use. 
4.  The nonconforming use of land shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use. 
5.  The nonconforming use of land, if changed to a conforming use, may not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use.

The owner or owners of the land on which the nonconforming use is located shall register such nonconforming use by filing with the City a registration statement for such nonconforming use on forms provided by the City. Such registration may be made on behalf of such owner by any person, firm, corporation or other entity that has a legal or equitable interest in the designated land or any structure or structures housing said nonconforming use. A copy of each registration statement shall be returned to the person or entity that filed it, a copy retained by the City and a copy of each original registration statement shall be recorded by the City in the Office of the Arapahoe County Clerk and Recorder. The City shall accept, lodge, and record all tendered registration statements, but the acceptance, lodging, and recording of the statements shall not constitute an authorization to operate an unlawful use. The filing of a false registration statement shall constitute a violation of this Title. 
2.  Annual Check by City. The City may send annually to the person or entity that has registered a nonconforming use, a questionnaire by mail, inquiring as to the operation, status and other details concerning the nonconforming use. If such notice is not returned, completed, within ninety (90) days, the City shall record in the Office of the Arapahoe County Clerk and Recorder a notice that the applicable nonconforming use is presumed to have been abandoned. A copy of this notice shall be sent to every person, firm, corporation or other entity shown by departmental records as then having a legal or equitable interest in the property; provided, however, if it is established to the satisfaction of the City that the applicable nonconforming use has not been terminated, the City shall record forthwith a certificate withdrawing the notice that the nonconforming use was presumed abandoned. 
3.  Time Extension. Nothing herein shall be deemed to grant an extension of the time required for registration or termination of nonconforming uses under a previously existing ordinance.

1.  Principal one-unit residential dwellings existing on the effective date of this Title, and which as of that date are not in compliance with the minimum setback standards established in Chapter 16-6 EMC, shall not be considered nonconforming structures due solely to the dwelling's noncompliance with the minimum setback standards. Such dwellings are "grandfathered," and shall be considered legal, conforming structures for the purposes of sale and development under this Title and other City building and safety regulations. All future expansions and alterations of such grandfathered dwellings shall comply with all applicable standards of this Title, including minimum setback standards, unless the City grants a variance. 
2.  Multi-unit dwellings existing on the effective date of this Title, which are not in compliance with the required minimum lot area per dwelling unit standards, shall not be considered nonconforming due solely to noncompliance with the minimum lot area per dwelling unit standards.

However, all future expansions and alterations of such grandfathered dwellings shall comply with all applicable standards of this Title, including minimum setbacks standards, unless the City grants a variance. 
B.  Nonconforming Building or Structure. 
1.  A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used, except as otherwise provided herein.

a.  The reconstructed building or structure shall not be more nonconforming than the structure as it existed immediately prior to the reconstruction. Redeveloped or reconstructed buildings or structures shall be allowed up to, but not to exceed, the density of the nonconforming building or structure as it existed immediately prior to the redevelopment, whichever is greater. 
b.  The reconstructed building or structure shall be brought into compliance as much as practicable with existing zoning standards of this Code (Examples: setbacks, parking, landscaping, bulk plane, etc.). The determination of "practicable" will be made by the City Manager or designee based upon the proposed use and design of the structure, site conditions, and current industry methods and standards. The City Manager or designee shall consider not only what is possible, but also what is reasonable based on the unique circumstances of the building or structure, proposed use, and site conditions. 
c.  If the damage to the nonconforming building or structure was caused by the intentional act or criminal conduct of the owner of the nonconforming building or structure, or the owner's agent or representative, the building or structure shall only be rebuilt in compliance with this Title and shall not be considered grandfathered under this Section, and furthermore shall not be eligible for redevelopment under Section 16-9-3(C) EMC. 
d.  Regardless of any waivers or lessening of standards otherwise required in this Title, all new development (including reconstruction of nonconforming buildings or structures) shall meet the applicable building, fire and safety codes in effect at the time of application for a building permit. 
D.  Application Process. 
1.  Reconstruction of a nonconforming building or structure shall follow the Site Improvement Plan Review process identified in Section 16-2-9 EMC, unless variances are requested for other dimensional or development standards. In such cases, variances shall follow the Zoning Variance process in Section 16-2-16 EMC. 
2.  A building permit application for reconstruction of a damaged or destroyed nonconforming building or structure shall be submitted within one (1) year from the date of the event that caused the damage or destruction.
